<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and loans through banks and secondary lending institutions but it will</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">also consider direct equity finance as well as facilitating franchising</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mechanisms over the longer term, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MISA has established through exhaustive research that lack of access</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to capital in the region remains a serious impediment to the development</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of a free, independent and pluralistic media. Samdef is intended to fill</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can no expect to build a strong civil society or promote</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ideas and information is hindered&quot;, said Leepile, who expressed the hope</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - The High Court in Tanzania has acquitted a journalist</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">charged and convicted of contravening the 1970 National Security Act,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reports MISA-Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freelance journalist Adam Mwaibabile was on February 28, this year</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">convicted to one year imprisonment by the Ruvuma Magistrate Court for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">being found in possession of a &quot;classified&quot; government document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwaibabile was, however, released on bail on March 21. The High Court</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">quashed the conviction and acquitted Mwaibabile on Tuesday, April 29.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(See further background and chronology of events below).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his ruling, Judge Dan Mapigano said that the Ruvuma Magistrate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Court which had convicted Mwaibabile &quot;had a misconception of the scope</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and spirit of the National Security Act of 1970.&quot; Mapigano said that the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">document Mwaibabile was found with &quot;had nothing to do with state</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">security.&quot; He explained that the National Security Act basically</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pertains to matters such as &quot;espionage, sabotage and activities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">prejudicial to the welfare and interests of the state.&quot; Judge Mapigano</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">went on to say that the document said to have been &quot;classified&quot; was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">itself &quot;an unlawful&quot; because it was meant to deprive Mwaibabile lawful</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">means of earning a living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BACKGROUND AND CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwaibabile was found in breach of the 1970 National Security Act for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">being found in possession of what the state had classified as &quot;a secret</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">state document&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter was, however, from the Ruvuma regional commissioner's</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">licence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - Sierra Leone. Lassa fever re-emerged as a public health</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">problem in Kenema in eastern Sierra Leone during 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From January to 19 April 1996, 799 cases with 148 deaths (CFR 18.5%)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">were reported. In the endemic Lassa fever situation an annual average of</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">40-50 cases normally occurred in this region. An elevated number of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lassa fever cases has continued to occur in 1997 with 45 cases reported</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in January, 75 in February and 147 in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increased occurrence is closely related to massive population</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">movements with subsequent crowding, poor sanitation, unsafe food</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">handling and storage practices combined with an increase in the rat</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">population. Furthermore, with the improving political and security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">situation in Sierra Leone, the populace is moving about more freely to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">access health care facilities resulting in increased case reporting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry of Health, WHO, the Centers for Disease Control and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prevention, USA and MERLIN, United Kingdom have worked together to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">monitor the outbreak and to mitigate its impact. Patients are brought to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and treated at an isolation ward established in Kenema which has been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">expanded to accommodate the increase in cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several workshops have been held to train health staff and to educate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the general public about measures to avoid contact with rodents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supplies of ribavirin, the antiviral drug used to treat Lassa virus</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">infections, were nearly depleted. The Red Cross was contacted regarding</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this need and the Chinese Red Cross responded with a donation of 120,000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">doses of the drug to the Government of Sierra Leone. WHO is working with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the pharmaceutical industry on a long-term solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Based on a report from WHO representative in Sierra Leone.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comment: Transmission of the Lassa virus in the community is mainly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">due to contact with rats of the genus Mastomys. Infected rats</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">continually shed viruses in their urine and humans are infected by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ingestion of food contaminated with rat urine or inhalation of virus-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">containing aerosols. Minimizing contact with rodents by the safe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">handling and storage of food or restricting access of rats to homes,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">remains therefore the most effective preventive measure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Person-to-person transmission occurs primarily in health care</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">institutions caring for Lassa patients. Nosocomial spread can easily be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">prevented by managing patients in isolation wards and with appropriate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">protective measures (barrier nursing). The risk of transmission during</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">international travel is low unless the traveller is in contact with a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">severely ill and bleeding case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent incident involving a virus which causes a similar clinial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">syndrome occurred in South Africa where a nurse was infected with Ebola</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">virus while caring for a patient from an endemic area. This underscores</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the importance of health care staff awareness and use of special</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">precautions when treating patients who have travelled abroad.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">upgrading training graduated here on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the course of the programme, some 20 journalists working with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the bureau were given theoretical and practical lessons on television</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">news and programme script writing, filming, sound and film editing and</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International Development authority (SIDA).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The training is organized by the regional women's affairs office in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It really deserves praise</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late in the week it was reported that the foundation established</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">after the late Aklilu Lema had signed an education and research</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cooperation agreement with the Addis Ababa University. During the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">agreement it was indicated that outstanding students and researchers in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">about seven faculties of the University would be offered scholarship and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">financial assistance every year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was also learned that as of next year upto 20 outstanding students</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would be assisted besides five researchers who would be entitled to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">receive 10,000 birr each year to help bring their research projects to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">success. One more point, students selected for their academic excellence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will also be given a stipend of 150 Eth. birr a month, a supply of books</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and settlement of payments for tutors on condition that the former keep</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their outstanding records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is worth noting here is that no matter how modest in financial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">terms the incentive given to researchers and outstanding students may</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">be, yet the idea and intention of it can not go without being commended</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">especially considering the need of the country for self-sufficiency and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">self-dependency. No question, Ethiopia has a hard working people but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unless hard-working is supported and upgraded by Education it will only</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have a limited impact on the overall development endeavours. to keep the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">country going on the road towards economic self-dependency, an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">indigenous innovations and creative are something we cannot afford to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ignore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this is only possible by way of a capacity building inn all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">aspects of life and the introduction of appropriate reward and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">incentives mechanisms for all those who go for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though implicitly and at times explicitly, what had destroyed the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">country during the past regimes was its erroneous application of reward</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and punishment mechanism which, as it should, was capable of nothing but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">an incessant fratricidal war and a primordial economic crisis. What</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">happened in plain words was that consumption was rewarded while</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investment-punished, intelligence was condemned while mediocrity-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">blessed, research results that would boost production and overcome</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">crises was practically taken as an outmoded fashion while irrelevant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">say-sos were taken as a mark of excellence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The price for such inverted mechanism was high-we had to begin from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the scratch and do whatever we can within our capacity to re-introduce</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the proper reward and punishment mechanism. it is with this in mind and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on such a ground that the aforementioned foundation really deserve</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recognition and praise.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the crowd were rushed to Matikwane Hospital and almost immediately</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">transferred to the Nelspruit Private Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sibuyi, who was shot in the head by police while addressing a crowd</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of roughly 2 000 demonstrators, was released after receiving treatment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for the flesh wound.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three other injured protesters are reportedly in a serious but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stable condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violence began when more than 10 000 protesters who had arrived</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at Pauliana Stadium in Bushbuckridge's CBD spilled into the surrounding</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">streets after Constitutional Affairs minister Valli Moosa failed to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">arrive at a scheduled Worker's Day rally.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to Mpumalanga. Almost 40 000 residents supporting the transfer have,</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">immediate militant response from youth in the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chanting &quot;Moosa, Moosa - Liar, Liar&quot;, the protesters streamed out of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the stadium and began re-erecting barricades on the R40 linking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bushbuckridge with Nelspruit and Marite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The barricades, consisting of trees and old vehicles, had earlier</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">other travelers were trapped in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White police officers also pushed reporters from African Eye News</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Service (South Africa) and SABC Radio News around while they attempted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to cover the burning of a police 4x4 bakkie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the officers screamed that &quot;we don't fucking care if you're</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reporters, we want all kaffirs out of this area&quot; when the reporters</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">protested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police also questioned other spectators and asked whether they were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pro- or anti- the transfer to Mpumalanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who answered 'yes' were beaten with fists and R4 rifle buts by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the policemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd dispersed during the tear gassing but later youths began</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">congregating on street corners and stoned police patrols.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bushbuckridge was quiet but tense after police began arresting</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Committee of the Cape Town City Council, is determined to bring the arts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to a wide spectrum of audiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have spent practically half my life improving my skills and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">talents, starting as a front-of-house worker welcoming audiences to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nico Malan Opera House,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have enjoyed every minute of it and I want to give back some of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the expertise to the land of my birth. It is going to be a challenge to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">run a theatre in a new South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't believe in doing it alone and I am sharing my ideas and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">different views with others. I network regularly with directors from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">other theatres and we hope to find a workable formula. We are confident</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">we will find the right formula for bringing audiences flocking back to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the theatre. We are seeking to captivate a new audience because the old</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">audiences we had are fast disappearing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phillips said he was prompted to leave Australia &quot;partly because my</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12-year-old daughter, Aileen, and my wife, Gillian, were always</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hankering to return to Cape Town to meet our relatives&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tripping down memory lane, he vividly recalled how his career began</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with a job as &quot;front-of-house&quot; worker at the Nico Malan Theatre. There</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he sought to carve a career for himself in theatre administration, &quot;but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to my great dismay I discovered there was nowhere in Cape Town or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">anywhere else in South Africa that one could train for such a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">profession&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After obtaining a Bachelor of Commerce degree at the University of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town, he applied for post-graduate course in London. He mastered</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">his craft and became sought after by &quot;headhunters&quot; in the theatrical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to being technically and artistically knowledgeable,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phillips also gained a wealth of experience from appointments to top</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">posts such as the administrative head of the Nico Malan Opera House, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Port Elizabeth Opera House, deputy general manager of the State Theatre</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Pretoria and chief executive to the Natal Performing Arts Council</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Napac), which he was credited with transforming and opening up for all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He held his Napac post for several years before venturing overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I left our shores out of frustration at the slow pace of change and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the general gloom and doom in what was then, unbeknown to everyone, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tail end of the apartheid era,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was appointed general manager of the Lyric Opera of Queensland in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brisbane and held the position for five years before being chosen from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">more than 100 applicants for the Sydney post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, after seeing many changes and experiencing the new</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">political climate while on a holiday in Cape Town, he decided to return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was heartened by the positive vibe and new spirit and was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">overwhelmed by a desire to return to my roots and plough back some of my</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">skills in the cultural development of the land of my birth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Baxter, which had not had a subsidy for its day-to day</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">operations for 19 years under the previous government, last year gained</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">its first small grant from the Department of Arts and Culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have no illusions about what is expected of me in a new South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa. It is a great challenge and I have a great opportunity to build</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Cape-based black investment grouping Ukhozi has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">successfully negotiated with two other up-country partners for a 51</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">percent stake in Nasionale Pers' City Press newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The up-country groupings are Durban-based Dynamo Investments, which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is headed by former Inkatha Freedom Party secretary general Oscar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dhlomo, and New Season's Investment, a company chaired by former</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KaNgwane chief minister Enos Mabuza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Dhlomo told the Cape Argus that the consortium had bought the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stake for R110 million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ukhozi will own 10 percent of City Press, with 20 percent going to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dynamo and 10 percent to New Season's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remaining shares will be made available to City Press staff, six</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">percent, and distributors, five percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naspers will retain the other 49 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal's tax efficiency was recently confirmed by the Receiver of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All that remained to be done was for the parties to sign</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">documentation authorising the sale, Dr Dhlomo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City Press has a weekly circulation of over 250 000 and ranks third</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">after top-selling Sunday newspapers the Sunday Times and Rapport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negotiations for the sale of the paper have been going on for close on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ukhozi managing director Lizo Ngcokoto said he was delighted that the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">deal had received the green light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The deal broadens Ukhozi's media interests. It gives us an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opportunity to have a sound asset base in the media industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sale also means that the consortium acquires Gauteng-based Khaya</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FM, a radio station in which City Press holds a stake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ngcokoto said Naspers had given the consortium pre-emptive rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to buy magazines Drum and True Love if they are sold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funds to acquire the City Press stake had been raised with a South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African financial institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We engaged one of the biggest banks in the country and the financing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mechanism is structured in such a way that it achieves the goals of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">black economic empowerment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ngcokoto would not name the bank or give details of the financing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mechanism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The City Press deal is the fourth empowerment acquisition in as many</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">months. Other newspapers that black investors have bought into include</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Sowetan, Sunday Times, and more recently, Enterprise magazine.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Osaka - The scene: a small confectioner's store in a residential</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">neighbourhood of Osaka, Japan. I am trying to find out what the shelf</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">life is of the cakes and chocolates on display. Nobody understands me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An elderly Japanese gentleman enters and translates. He asks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">conversationally: &quot;So, where are you from?&quot; I reply: &quot;Cape Town, South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa.&quot; &quot;Ah,&quot; he says, &quot;Cape Town 2004, the Olympic city.&quot; He</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">translates for the shopkeeper, who raises both thumbs in delighted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the many surprises which a Capetonian might encounter in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bustle of modern Japan, perhaps the most agreeable is the discovery that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town enjoys far wider, and far more positive, name recognition than</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Johannesborregi&quot; or, for that matter, any other city in Africa. And,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">almost invariably, it is because of Cape Town's bid for the 2004 Olympic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many encounters with Japanese during a visit to Japan last month</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for the launch of the first South African Airways service to Japan, I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">found &quot;Cape Town&quot; and &quot;2004 Olympics&quot; to be almost synonymous. The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Japanese knew about Table Mountain, the city's old identifying icon, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">they especially knew that Cape Town was one of the five finalists in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">race to host the 2004 Games - and they were intrigued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their interest is understandable and, to some extent, selfish. And it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">could be ominous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Osaka, Japan's second largest city, is a huge, wealthy and sharply</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">focused contender for the 2008 Olympics. So is Yokohama (which,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">confusingly, is also described as the country's second largest city),</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and the two are now embroiled in an thunderous face-off. And, of course,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tokyo hosted the 1964 Olympics and Nagoya will be hosting the next</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">winter Olympics. So, Japan is Olympics-sensitive to a degree which few</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">other countries are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Osaka, there seemed to be a pervasive belief that Cape Town would</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">be knocked out of the 2004 race by Athens or Rome, and that Osaka (or,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">they reluctantly concede, Yokohama) would face Cape Town in the battle</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for the 2008 Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now we are comrades in the struggle,&quot; Takashi Onodera, general</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">manager of Osaka's Olympic Bid public relations department told me, &quot;but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">we may be opponents in 2008 - and we take Cape Town very seriously as a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">potential rival. That would be what you might describe as Osaka's worst</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nightmare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His colleague, Shigeyuki Matsushita, felt Cape Town enjoyed vastly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">more international recognition than Osaka. &quot;In the Far East, Osaka is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">well known. But if you mention Japan to the average European or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American, or African, they think of Tokyo. We are trying to change that,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">but we do not have a Table Mountain, or an Eiffel Tower or a Golden Gate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bridge, or anything which can distinguish us in the minds of people as a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">city in its own right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cape Town used to be like that. I think some people used to think</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that Table Mountain was in Johannesburg because Johannesburg was the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African city we then knew most about. But your Olympic Bid has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">given you a lot of recognition. Ah, people say, the city with that big</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">flat mountain is Cape Town, it is fighting for the Olympics in 2004, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">maybe in 2008, and that is a battle we understand, which we have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">witnessed before in our own country. Cape Town today is a familiar name,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with its own identity, throughout Japan. It has far overtaken</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg in name recognition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As domestic interest in Japan's Olympic ambitions has grown, so, too,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has interest in Cape Town and other contending cities as tourist</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">destinations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cape Town has had a lot of attention in Japan with the Olympic bid,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and now that there is a direct SAA air link between Osaka and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg and on to Cape Town, there is a lot more interest - mostly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Cape Town,&quot; said Masuji Takagi, a leading Osaka travel and tourism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">analyst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The twice-weekly SAA link, from Johannesburg via Bangkok to Kansai</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Osaka's new and breathtaking airport), is expected to boost tourism in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">both countries, but Chuhei Sanjo, general manager of one of the largest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">travel companies in Japan, who has been involved in travel to and from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa for more than 33 years, sounds a warning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Japanese tourists are very demanding. They expect good service,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">value added service and, given the fact that the typical Japanese</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tourist has between eight and 10 days a year for a holiday, 12 days at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the absolute most, and that they would have to forfeit perhaps more than</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">two days of that in flying back and forth to South Africa, they want</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">something out of the ordinary; a very special experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, they like Cape Town and they like the game parks of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have the money to travel there, but what is crucial to them is the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">time and the quality of the experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For these reasons, I would caution against expectations of the new</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">air service bringing about an explosion of Japanese tourists at this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stage. There will be more, for sure, but not a sudden deluge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I asked Mr Sanjo what the Japanese tourism industry thought of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">general service quality in Cape Town, the preferred destination of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">15 000 Japanese who now visit South Africa each year. With evasive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">politeness, he smiled and replied: &quot;Cape Town is a beautiful city.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A widely voiced Japanese complaint about visiting South Africa is the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">difficulty of communicating with South Africans, even in English. The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">diversity of South African accents falls confusingly on the Japanese</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ear, even the ears of those Japanese who have studied English and who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">use it fluently in conversations with English-speaking visitors in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has something to do with the way South Africans pronounce vowels,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and the difference in pronunciation between white and black South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africans when they use English. There does not appear to be a standard</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">form of the language in your country. Also, Japanese pronunciation of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">English is sometimes difficult to follow unless you are familiar with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the mistakes we typically make in pronouncing consonants,&quot; a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">professional translator told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The solution is to train more Japanese-speaking guides, and here</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town should take the lead as the city which most Japanese tourists</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">want to visit. To my knowledge, there is only one such guide in Cape</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Town. That's not good enough. Perhaps you should fly in Japanese</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">students during our summer vacations. But something should be done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will more South Africans visit Japan now that there is a direct SAA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">link? They should. Japan is a wonderland of modern efficiency,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">politeness and cleanliness - and safety. And it has a rich history and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tradition which makes it easily as fascinating as any of the present</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">popular destinations in the Far East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What appears to deter many South Africans from venturing into Japan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are the prices and, indeed, it is a very pricey country even by London</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Paris standards. Like all freemarket economies, though, Japan offers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a wide spectrum of prices for just about everything - if you are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">prepared to be adventurous and explore areas of the country where most</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tourists might not venture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subway systems in cities like Tokyo and Osaka, for example, are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">highly accessible to strangers and are the antidote to expensive (and,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">late at night, ruinously expensive) taxis. They are clean - and entirely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">safe. All maps, notices, directions and names are given in Japanese and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">English. There are information kiosks at most of the major stations with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fluent English-speaking assistants. And I discovered that looking lost</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with a map in hand is an irresistible temptation to young Japanese eager</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to practise their English and show off their city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The costly tourist hotels, likewise, can be replaced by &quot;ryokan&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(traditional Japanese inns), or by family-run &quot;minshuku&quot; (guest houses),</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and many Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples offer overnight</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">accommodation. Standards of cleanliness and safety are excellent, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">prices are a fraction of what you would pay in a hotel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cheaper restaurants in the underground malls of larger railway</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stations and shopping centres are not only interesting and authentic,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">but usually are delighted to receive foreign visitors. And the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">traditional night-life areas of the big cities, such as Dotombori Street</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Osaka or the Akasaka area of Tokyo offer excellent and inexpensive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">meals, a bewildering panoply of pubs, sushi bars, hostess clubs, pinball</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">arcades and specialty stores where not many tourists go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Japanese trains are efficient, clean and punctual and one of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">great wonders of the country is the Shinkansen, or &quot;bullet train&quot; which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">flashes across the countryside at an average of more than 400km an hour</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">between Osaka and Tokyo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Osaka offers brilliant shops, symphony concerts, festivals, museums,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">markets, harbour tours and a new waterfront development which contains a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">spectacular aquarium encompassing marine life of the entire Pacific rim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Osaka is also a convenient entry and exit point for a brief stay that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">could exclude Tokyo, an immense but somewhat trying city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kyoto, the old imperial capital, with its magnificent palaces,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">castles and stroll gardens, is a 40-minute bus ride from Osaka. It was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">spared by American bombers during the war and is today a city of immense</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">charm and interest - as is the neighbouring city of Nara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kansai airport, which serves the entire greater Osaka region, is a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dazzling science fiction feat of design and engineering; an airport to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">beat all airports. It offers probably as many connections to other</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cities of Asia and the Pacific as does Narita airport outside Tokyo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Tokyo is a tiring metropolis, it is also most imposing and has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">much to inform Capetonians about the Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we hosted the 1964 Olympics, Japan had no real sense of itself</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as a major economic entity and Tokyo did not see itself as a world</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">city,&quot; according to Hidekazu Morishima, general manager of international</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">planning at the giant Nissho Iwai Corporation. &quot;The '64 Olympics</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">propelled us into the modern world and gave Tokyo a huge economic boost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a milestone in our development.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Turning gangsters into peace-makers is the essence of a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">revolutionary Olympic-related strategy being launched today to enlist</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the underworld in the fight against crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gangs and their members are to be given responsibility for curbing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">violence and lawlessness in terms of a manifesto in which they declare</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their willingness to &quot;act as the protectors of the community&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the drug trade will not be affected by the project at this stage.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strategy, dubbed the Olympic Peace Initiative, will run for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">three-months, with the emphasis on curbing murder, rape, assaults,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">robbery, housebreaking and theft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first project from today until May 14 will be to rid the central</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">city and Bo-Kaap of criminal activity, and clear street kid gangs from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Township children will be taken back to their homes, in terms of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">plan, and those without homes will be taken to child-care centres. Gangs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have undertaken to &quot;use their influence&quot; to halt central city muggings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and other crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The launch of the potentially controversial scheme follows weeks of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">discussions with gang leaders, who on Monday committed themselves to an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">inter-gang peace accord, and to stopping all crimes of violence against</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the community by their members. More details will be announced later</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gangs' commitment to a peace manifesto will be monitored by an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">independent group of prominent community leaders. Ultimately, the aim is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to rehabilitate gangsters and draw them into the mainstream of society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leading figure in the project is Brian Williams, chairman of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town Community Olympic Forum, an independent, pro-bid body</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">representing civics and other organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Williams said the approach carried &quot;huge risks&quot;, but had the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">potential to &quot;dramatically reduce crime&quot;, and deserved support since all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">other strategies had failed. &quot;The gangs will take ownership of the anti-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">crime strategy and be responsible for it. We think this is a coup, to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">get gangsters to become peace-makers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of Justice Dullah Omar had &quot;reacted positively&quot; to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">initiative in a meeting this week. The strategy was also discussed by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Cabinet at its meeting in Pretoria yesterday. Bid Company chief</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">executive Chris Ball, who supports the initiative, was present at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">yesterday's meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conditional support has also been given by the Cape Chamber of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commerce and Industry, and other community organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Williams said Pagad had been informed, adding: &quot;We believe there</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is no difference between our objectives and Pagad's objectives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Schotse Kloof Civic Association representing an area that is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">about 98 percent Muslim has unanimously backed the initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Association chairman Yusuf Larney said: &quot;It's no use fighting and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">killing each other, because the problem will still be there. Our</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">affiliate organisations have backed this 100 percent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Williams said crime and violence constituted the major weakness of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's bid, and this had impelled the Community Olympic Forum to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">launch the peace initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not afraid of the risks of this initiative because my political</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">record is sufficiently strong to sustain me against any kind of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">integrity attacks. All we are asking for is three months, to see if this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">strategy can work. We have tried everything else.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The strategy to engage gangsters directly in a fresh bid</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to curb crime deserves to be given a chance, especially since</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">conventional law and order initiatives have failed to produce results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the view of Brian Williams, one of the key figures in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olympic Peace Initiative, being launched today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is chairman of the Cape Town Community Olympic Forum, an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">independent organisation representing several hundred civics and other</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">community organisations in promoting the bid.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Williams, a former unionist, is the director of the Department of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour in the Western Cape. He acknowledged that the &quot;law-breakers to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">peace-makers&quot; initiative carried &quot;huge risks&quot; but argued that since</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gangsterism was at the heart of much of the lawlessness and violence of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Western Cape, it was foolhardy to assume that a solution could</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exclude gangs themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crime had been singled out as the biggest threat to the Olympic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opportunity, and was a huge cost to the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are asking the public to give this initiative a chance. Let us</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">see what can be achieved. The overall objective is to secure a way to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">integrate gangsters into the mainstream of society, to draw them into</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rehabilitation and vocational programmes and to help them get jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Williams added: &quot;All anti-crime approaches have been on a level</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which excludes direct involvement with gang leaders. What we have done</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is to undertake this as a principled campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also acknowledged there was a measure of scepticism about the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;morality&quot; of concluding peace contracts with gang leaders, a point</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">raised in an otherwise supportive letter to the forum by Alan Lighton,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">executive director of the Cape Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Williams said: &quot;This is an issue, and we will encourage open and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">healthy debate about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While there may be a contradiction in this, we believe the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">initiative has the capacity to propel us towards a solution, towards</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reconciliation, community healing and ultimately the creation of jobs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and the generation of wealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a powerful economic logic embedded in the project which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">compels us to go this route. Every other route has been tried. Law and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">order budgets of the past few years have increased steadily, but so has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So our plea is that we be given the space to attempt this considered</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">route to achieve a reduction in crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The government has announced a drop in the rate of some</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">serious crime and has projected significant breakthroughs in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">delivery of its reconstruction and development promises</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps more so than the promises made by most governments, those</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">proclaimed by South Africa's new and untried administration when it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">first took office were met with acclaim but also with a good measure of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">scepticism. And as the country's many problems - especially the alarming</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">crime rate - continued to grow unabated, the scepticism appears to have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">turned into a cynical pessimism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a mid-term &quot;report to the nation&quot;, the Government has claimed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">progress in delivering on its promises. The report says that the rate of</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">serious crime dropped in nine out of 20 categories last year, including</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">murder, car hijackings and aggravated robbery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also projects imminent breakthroughs in the delivery of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RDP projects, stating among other things that the school feeding</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">programme will benefit some 5-million pupils by the end of the year,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that 200 000 houses will be built, and that the community water supply</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and sanitation programme will serve a further 1,7-million people this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the projected delivery on RDP projects might still fall within</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the definition of promises, the reported national drop in some serious</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">crime has been presented as a fait accompli and appears to be supported</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by available evidence from the police and other sources. This is most</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">encouraging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In several surveys crime has been identified as the single greatest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">concern of most South Africans, transcending even poverty, and whether</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">or not the Government is able to meet the deadline it has set for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">delivery on social programmes this year, progress in combating serious</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">crime should help to reduce the debilitating spirit of cynicism and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pessimism which seems to pervade so much of the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - A small army of about 30 heavily armed Pagad members</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">invaded the Bo-Kaap early today, opening fire on the home of an alleged</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">drug dealer with pistols and shotguns before setting fire to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five occupants of the house were injured, two of them seriously, when</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the fifth and by far the largest attack this week on suspected</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the conflict.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police believe all five attacks were carried out by members of People</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mini-invasion at 3.10am was aimed at three brothers, Noor,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mogamat and Abdurachman Jardien and their families, in the Chiappini</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Street home they shared. It lasted about 15 minutes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was sleeping in my room upstairs when I heard glass breaking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">downstairs,&quot; said Mr Jardien.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The next moment all hell broke loose. Gunshots rang out, they were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shooting through the windows from the outside - and then they lobbed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">petrol bombs through three of the windows at the front, side and back of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the house. We were trapped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I ran downstairs, but smoke and flames drove me back up. The only</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">way out was through a window on to the roof.&quot; The sickly Mr Jardien had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to jump from the roof of the house to escape the fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a miracle nobody was wounded in the gunfire,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The shooting just carried on - my brothers and the women and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">children were hiding under their beds while bullets flew over their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">heads.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile the attackers assaulted the men one by one as they emerged</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from the burning house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mogamat Jardien was pistol- whipped and chased to Rose Street by a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">man wielding a pistol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abdurachman Jardien, 20, was hit over the head and in the face with a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pick handle and collapsed on the ground. Salie Jardien was pistol-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">whipped and afterwards had blood gushing down his face from a deep cut</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A family friend, Patrick Matthews, also had serious head injuries and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was taken to hospital with Mr Abdurachman Jardien.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attackers damaged a minibus parked in the backyard of the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's raid followed four previous Pagad-related attacks in the past</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">five days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Athlone a car was damaged early yesterday after a home-made device</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exploded on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The car belonged to George Smith of Kudu Street. Mr Smith also denied</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he was connected to drug-dealing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two home-made bombs were hurled at homes of suspected drug dealers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">early on Monday and a bomb exploded at the home of an Ottery man on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday, causing severe damage to the house and vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said the home-made devices which were hurled at houses in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cassel Street and Bolton Road, Crawford, did not explode but broke</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">windows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The angry owner of the Ottery house that came under attack early on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday, Hendrik April, challenged Pagad to meet him &quot;face to face&quot; in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">daylight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr April said he had been warned earlier to stop dealing in drugs,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">but still came under attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than R200 000 damage was caused to a minibus, a car, the house</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and garage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile police have intensified their efforts to investigate Pagad,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">drug-dealing and gangsterism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police spokesman Mark Romburgh said police had prioritised Pagad-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">related attacks since the weekend and would would focus their anti-crime</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">plan on these activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captain Romburgh said the continuous attacks on drug-dealers, or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">people thought to be drug dealers, was illegal and could also target</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">innocent people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will leave no stone unturned to bring the perpetrators to book ,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police management appreciates the community's stance against</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gangsterism and drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But people cannot be allowed to take the law in their own hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The community must supply police with information about drug dealing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">or any other illegal activities - then we will act,&quot; said Captain</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - The OAU Secretary-General, Salim Ahmed Salim,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">says parties to the Zairian conflict should seek a negotiated transition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rather than military solution to the crisis in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We (the OAU) have been saying that it is important to put an end to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the war and negotiate a transition that will create a new dispensation</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">half of the country in a six-month military campaign had an advantage,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the talks would however provide a &quot;unique opportunity to discuss the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">question of transition&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OAU chief was accompanied by a 30-member delegation including a</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigerians Friday welcomed reports that their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">soccer star, Nwankwo Kanu, has fully recovered from his heart problem,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">raising the hope that he could feature in the June 7 World Cup African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">zone qualification match against Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's sports minister Jim Nwobodo was philosophical on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hearing the news. &quot;The Lord has done something wonderful for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">country. We should all be grateful,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a welcome development for Nigerian football,&quot; declared Rtd</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Col. Abdulmumuni Aminu, chairman of the Nigerian Football Association</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(NFA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aminu, who led a government delegation earlier this year to see Kanu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at the Cleveland hospital in the U.S. where the player underwent surgery</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to rectify a defective aorta valve, said &quot;Kanu has so much to offer not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">only to Nigeria but the entire soccer world.&quot; The Nigerian government</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sent Kanu 50,000 U.S. dollars to help settle his medical bills for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">heart operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News of the player's recovery featured prominently Friday in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria's vibrant press. The story was competing for space with results</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the British general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kanu For France 98,&quot; screamed the &quot;Nigerian Tribune&quot;, in a reference</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to Nigeria's campaign for the World Cup qualification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Daily Champion&quot; came up with the banner &quot;Kanu Now Fit To Play,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a sentiment shared by most other national dailies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kanu was the skipper of the Nigerian under-23 squad that won Africa's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">first Olympic soccer gold in Atlanta in 1996. He was later voted the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African Footballer of the Year 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But trouble started when the striker decided to change clubs,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">switching from Ajax of the Netherlands following a two-year contract he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">signed with Italy's Inter-Milan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inter-Milan's cardiologists alarmed the soccer world with news that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kanu had a heart problem that could end his career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on Thursday, the Cleveland hospital surgeons, who operated on him</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">five months ago, certified him fit to resume his soccer career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the doctors, John Kramer said Kanu, 20, &quot;is stronger now</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">physically than he was before the operation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Popular opinion in Lagos is that Nigeria's search for a play-maker is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">now over with Kanu's recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without the lanky player, Nigeria's campaign for the World Cup ticket</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has been described as lack-lustre by soccer fans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's next match is against Kenya on June 7 in Lagos. To keep</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">its chances for qualification, the team needs a win, after both teams</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">played a 1-1 draw in Nairobi in the first leg, in Nairobi. Although</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria is currently on top of Group I, which also includes Burkina Faso</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Guinea with 10 points, the Super Eagles need a convincing win</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">against Kenya, which is second, to clinch the France '98 ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aminu says he has no objection to fielding Kanu in that match against</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya, although the decision is for the national team's technical crew</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to make.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian FA sources indicated that the new &quot;Super Eagles&quot; technical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">adviser, frenchman Phillipe Troussier, who is soon to embark on an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">European tour aimed at assembling Nigerian players, is expected to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">contact Kanu for the crucial match on June 7.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. ZAIRE - most information as of 29 April</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 Aid agencies continue to carry out air and road survey missions,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">trying to locate Rwandan refugees scattered in forests south of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kisangani. As reported last week, over 85,000 refugees left their camps</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">estimated to be between 10,000 and 15,000. Arrangements have been made</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that this deadline may not be strictly applied. Authorities have agreed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to open up roads and airports for the repatriation. The plan is to move</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the refugees who are between Kisangani and Biaro to Kisangani and from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">there by air to Rwanda. The refugees who are concentrated between Biaro</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Ubundu will be moved to the airstrip at km 95 from where they will</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">be flown to Rwanda. The first airlift of refugees directly to Kigali</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">took place on 27 April. On 30 April, several hundred refugees were moved</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from Biaro to Kisangani by train, a trip organised by rebel authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These and other refugees arriving in Kisangani are being flown to Kigali</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in WFP and UNHCR planes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 The international airport at Kisangani is now open for aid</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">flights. WFP planes airlifting food from Entebbe in Uganda and Mwanza in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzania started landing there on 30 April, instead of at the Municipal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">airport used so far. From 21 and 27 April, WFP delivered over 550 metric</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tons of commodities to Kisangani. WFP stocks as of 29 April total 1,040</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to Goma, since the beginning of this operation on 15 April. It is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">estimated that the total number of internally displaced persons still</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">remaining in Kisangani is around 6,000 to 7,000 persons, a much lower</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">figure than previously estimated. A new registration exercise is under</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">process, to determine the new caseload for purposes of food</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. RWANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.1 From January to end April, WFP delivered 53,455 metric tons of</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">510 metric tons were provided for distribution to returnees and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">displaced persons, amounting to 2.9 million rations of mixed food</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commodities. WFP plans to move some 14,000 metric tons of food</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commodities to Rwanda during the month of May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.2 WFP has released the first instalment of funds to support relief</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">food distributions by the National Food Committee (NFC). WFP is</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">procurement process is due to be completed by mid May. In total, WFP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will provide up to USD 293,000 to the NFC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.3 WFP is discussing with USAID, FAO and the National Food Committee</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the establishment of a Food Assessment Unit. Discussions have also been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">maintained with SCF-UK related to a Food Assessment Monitoring and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Household Food Security Survey Unit. It is expected that this unit will</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">identify pockets of poverty and areas considered to be vulnerable,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">helping WFP to target programme activities more accurately and assisting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in building the capacity of the Government in the management and use of</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. BURUNDI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.1 WFP has conducted a road transport assessment of the route to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uvira, in anticipation of planned road convoys through Burundi to Uvira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is in view of the expected pre-positioning of food in Uvira for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">returning refugees from Kigoma camps in Tanzania. All clearances have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been received from the Burundian Government and clearances from AFDL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">authorities are now awaited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.2 WFP is considering the provision of short-term assistance in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gatara commune, Kayanza province, after a storm devastated crops in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.3 Current food stocks in Burundi stand at 2,586 metric tons. This</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is sufficient to cover requirements for the next month, except for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pulses which are sufficient to cover requirements for two weeks. From 21</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to 27 April WFP distributed 527 metric tons of food to 173,336</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.1 Close to 7,000 Burundian refugees crossed the Biharu and Kitanga</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">border points and entered Kasulu district in Tanzania, between 21 and 27</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">April. UNHCR is trucking the most vulnerable refugees while the others</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.2 The repatriation of Zairean refugees in Kigoma has not yet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">started, pending clearance from UNHCR in Uvira, Zaire. There are an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">estimated 80,000 Zaireans in Kigoma and 5,000 have already registered</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for repatriation. It is considered likely that if a first group</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">repatriates successfully, most of the others would follow. Food to Uvira</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will be transported either by barge from Kigoma or by truck through</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi, as described above.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.3 Deteriorating road conditions in Kigoma continue to hamper food</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">deliveries. Trucks are stuck 75 km away from Kasulu, heading towards</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lugufu camp. This is affecting the stock position of food commodities in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the camp. Very poor road conditions are also affecting the supply of</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 Security remains uncertain in many parts of northern Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rhino Camp, a Sudanese refugee settlement in Arua was attacked on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">night of 21 April. An NGO compound in Arua was also attacked. In</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palorinya, another settlement for Sudanese refugees located in east</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moyo, refugees and local populations have reported harassment and</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">movements of aid agency personnel and the road between Gulu and Pakelle</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is described as unsafe, with clashes between Government soldiers and</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from Tanzania during December and January, and who are presently in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">camps in south-western Uganda, to repatriate by 15 May. Government</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">officials visiting the camps have been passing this message to the</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">provided after this date. Some 7,000 Rwandan refugees came to Uganda</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 WFP completed distribution of three-month resettlement rations to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">more than 220,000 resettled internally displaced persons in early April</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 A total of 57 rebels have surrendered to local authorities and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">spontaneous demobilisation continues. Although this kind of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">demobilisation is seen as a positive sign, the peace process is at a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">standstill as the power struggle among the rebels continues since the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ousting of RUF founder Foday Sankoh in March. On 29 March, three members</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the Commission for the Consolidation of Peace were abducted by RUF</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - The Swaziland government says it is in the process of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">designing an editorial policy for all government-controlled media, a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">statement issued on April 21 from the Prime Minister's office reads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This policy will take cognisance of the Swazi Nation's interest for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">balanced information instead of being hijacked and controlled by certain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pressure groups,&quot; it states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement has been signed by the Director of Public Policy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coordination Unit in the Prime Minister's office, Meshack Shongwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, privately-owned newspaper, Times of Swaziland, reported that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government's statement was coming barely after reports that authorities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">criticised Swazi Television for its full coverage of opposition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swaziland Democratic Alliance (SDA) demonstrations. The article appeared</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the papers April 22 Edition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SDA went on a demonstration on April 12 against the 1973</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proclamation banning free political activity. April 12 marked 24 years</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the King Sobhuza 1973 Decree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Decree effectively nullified the 1968 Constitution as well as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">free political activity and the right to free expression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swazi Television had covered and broadcast in full police disruption</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the opposition SDA protest demonstrations on April 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior journalist for the weekend state-controlled newspaper, The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swazi Observer, told MISA that about 18 people were brutally assaulted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by the police during the crackdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afraid to be named, the journalist said: &quot;Journalists were barred</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from taking pictures of the police crackdown on demonstrators.&quot; The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">journalist spoke to MISA on Friday, May 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Swazi Observer newspaper reported in its April 23 edition that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Swaziland National Association of Journalists (SNAJ) condemned the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government's attitude towards the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Association's Secretary-General, Banele Ginindza said in a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">statement that censorship, in any form, does not augur well with a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nation that claims to embrace the principals of democratic governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ginindza reportedly said that if what government spokesman, Meshack</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shongwe had said was not dictatorship &quot;then SNAJ does not know what to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">call it.&quot; Adding: &quot;Censorship of the media in any form is self</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">misleading of a government that aspires to develop the lives of its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By attempting to censor the media, Ginindza reportedly went on,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government is leaving the whole nation in the dark about what goes on in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the country. &quot;'Surely,'&quot; Ginindza reportedly said, &quot;'the nation can read</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">between the lines on the kind of governance it will be subjected to if</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the new (media) policies are successful.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gininzda was also reported as saying that &quot;'the question of who makes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the news has never been left at the discretion of the government for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">precisely the same reason that governments are easily dictatorial.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, on April 15, the government issued a press statement in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which it said it was concerned by media reports that &quot;journalists were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not given or afforded the freedom they so deserve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement, however, said the government wished to reaffirm that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">freedom of the press was guaranteed in line with acceptable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">international standards and other relevant conventions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement adds: &quot;It is not the intention of this Government to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dictate media policy for private sector media houses, and in turn, we do</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not expect these media houses to dictate policy to Government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently referring to the April 12 SDA protests, the statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">adds: &quot;It is the responsibility of Government, however, not to promote</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">illegal activities, hence Government owned Media Houses shall not be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">encouraged to promote illegal activities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister for Public Service and Information, Muntu Mswane, issued the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">statement and was aired on Radio Swaziland on April 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MISA-Swaziland has equally criticised government's move saying: &quot;The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">media in Swaziland will be facing yet another pillar of censorship.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Gauteng socialites relocating to Mpumalanga may find the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">experience to be a traumatic trek into a cultural desert where Afrikaans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">folk singers and awkward school plays are presented as &quot;art&quot; by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">municipal theatres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shortage of bookshops and cinemas will also make the move more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">alarming, but the province does have redeeming features which, once</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">found, may turn the trek into a voyage of discovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only is the province home to international tourist destinations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">such the Kruger National Park, Pilgrim's Rest and the Blyde River</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canyon, it also borders Mozambique and Swaziland, two international</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tourist destinations offering a touch of the exotic at cheap prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, being a tourist in Mpumalanga is a lot different to being a</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what do the regular residents do for fun, especially considering</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that the provincial capital, Nelspruit, has only one cinema which has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">three theatres specialising in movies of the Jean-Claude Van Damme and</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who have escaped from Gauteng for whatever reason, say they</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">film society at one stage hired movies from Johannesburg to be watched</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and discussed by society members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, the numerous video shops in town are popular and where those</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">art movies not shown at the cinema are readily available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attempts to promote the Nelspruit Art Gallery were, however, a dismal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">failure, says Voigt, who was also curator at the gallery for eight</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was just no culture in this town. I'd organise an art exhibit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and only 20 people would come, and then they'd all be my friends,&quot; she</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">laughs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nelspruit town council recently built a yellow-brick theatre with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government-style floor tiles which so far has presented numerous school</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">plays, hypnotists, and, overwhelmingly successfully for a conservative</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">town, the Soweto String Quartet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In general however, residents of especially Witbank and Middelburg</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">happily drive the hour-or-so journey to Johannesburg or Pretoria to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">attend the big city theatres and art galleries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those in the Lowveld do so too, but have also found Maputo City to be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a fulfilling attraction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mozambique is very much the in-thing at the moment,&quot; explains Auke</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keyser, chairperson of the Nelspruit Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only does it offer an African-Portuguese flavour, but also pristine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">beaches, unspoilt reserves and some of the world's best fishing spots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The hijacking of visitors to Mozambique hasn't put anyone off either</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- they always believe it will happen to their neighbour,&quot; Keyser</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">explains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One person who frequently socialises in Maputo and has a flat there</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is Orna O'Reilly, an internationally acclaimed interior decorator who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">decorates ambassadors homes in Maputo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I go to lots of dinner parties in Maputo and on holidays or weekends</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">spend time on the beaches where we lie in the sun and drink beer,&quot; she</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We often go to Piggs Peak in Swaziland as well and try our luck at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gambling,&quot; she adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One place in Mpumalanga that is no longer quiet at weekends or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">holidays is Dullstroom, the trout fisher's paradise. Over weekends,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pajeros and 4X4s which seldom hit dirt roads in Gauteng suddenly clog</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dullstroom's main street and the fly and tackle business booms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You'll also find numerous locals waist high in cool lakes and happily</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">throwing a line, despite the intrusion by the loud &quot;city types&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What initially attracts those &quot;city types&quot; to the Lowveld, says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit Publicity Association agent, Christelle Thompson, is the good</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">weather and scenery of the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have about 150 people a day showing an interest in moving here,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">five to 10 percent of which actually relocate,&quot; Thompson says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously the fact that all the big businesses are also in Nelspruit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">plays a big role,&quot; she adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young entrepreneurs and career starters in Gauteng who have kept an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">eye open for business opportunities, soon heard of the Maputo Corridor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and have arrived in swarms to start up small businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially balking at the lack of nightclubs and &quot;hang-outs&quot; the self-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">starters have instead joined local hiking clubs and para-gliding</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">outfits, as well as sport clubs such as the local mountain biking club</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and golf club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The old Nelspruit, a one-horse town surrounded by rich burly farmers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and their burly wives has quickly given way to a more genteel society</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which has learnt to accept that yoga classes are not as evil as the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dominee said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three cars which constituted home-time traffic, has swelled to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">about 50 and the end of month traffic stretches across three consecutive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">traffic lights as the small town groans under the pressure of a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">population explosion last seen during the Gold Rush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit has become a mini city where farmers coming into town for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their monthly shopping sprees have learnt that driving slowly in their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Toyota Hiluxes is just as hazardous as those city types whizzing by in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their Pajeros.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Legal opposition to the Mpumalanga Tender Board's policy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of awarding contracts to provincially based black companies crumbled</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this week after the Pretoria High Court dismissed the only serious</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">challenge to the policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legal challenge, mounted by Tricor Industries in September 1995,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">accused the Tender Board of racism, bias and malpractice for failing to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">award a R1-million sign board contract to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tricor submitted the lowest tender offer but made no attempt to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">comply with the Tender Board's stated policy of favouring companies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which set up local offices or brought in a black joint venture partner.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After loosing the tender, Tricor charged that the Tender Board had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ignored all economic or technical criteria and had instead used its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">affirmative action and black empowerment policies as the sole criteria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High Court Judge Kirk Cohen said on Wednesday that even if the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">original contract was set aside, Tricor would not benefit as the one-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">year contract had already been completed and a second related contract</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">had also recently been lost by Tricor in favour of the same company</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which previously won; Matane Nameplate Joint Ventures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the case was therefore only of academic interest and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that it appeared as if Tricor want to use the issue to build a damages</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">claim against the Mpumalanga Provincial Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ruling is quite a victory for us, as it vindicates our policy of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">trying to empower local black companies. Previously, because we are a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">new and quite rural province, all the large companies operated from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng,&quot; said Tender Board member, Vincent Khoza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This meant that all the potential wealth creation resulting from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government projects flowed out of Mpumalanga. Our policies are designed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to keep that money here, where it does our people the most good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khoza added that the stipulation that companies should include some</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">form of joint venture with black or other disadvantaged companies had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">also been abused by tender bidders who used black faces as &quot;window</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dressing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This use of front men is one of our biggest problems at the moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The policy was designed to force experienced companies to share their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">expertise with emergent businesses but instead, we have a few front men</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">getting rich for doing nothing while the predominantly white companies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">continue doing all the work,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, the Tender Board has just launched a 'Joint Venture Task</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Team' to redesign the criteria for valid joint ventures and now place</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the emphasis on measurable forms of capacity building.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">indiscriminately on protesters in Bushbuckridge this week and threatened</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">journalists, Northern Province police have appealed to the public to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">come forward with information so that an internal investigation can be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">conducted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bushbuckridge residents blocked major roads, including the road to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Kruger Gate of the Kruger National Park, with burnt-out vehicles on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday in an attempt to force the Northern Province and Mpumalanga</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">governments to agree that Bushbuckridge be incorporated into Mpumalanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, police were again sent in when a crowd of about 10 000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">people went on the rampage after Minister of Constitutional Affairs,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Valli Moosa, failed to arrive and address them at the Paulianah stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secretary of the Border Committee, Sizile Ndlovu, said demonstrations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">had been peaceful, until hundreds of police arrived in five hippos, a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">helicopter and police vans.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation got out of control because the police arrived to shoot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and kill, instead of bringing peace and stability,&quot; Ndlovu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Northern Province police spokesperson, Superintendent Phuti Setati,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said the demonstrations were not peaceful, as a complex of more than 10</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home Affairs offices was burnt, as were a tractor, a government van and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a police bakkie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four people were also injured during the shooting, including</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bushbuckridge South councillor, Doctor Sibiya, who was grazed in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">head by a bullet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, two large refrigerated trucks were ambushed and set alight</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by toyi-toying protesters at Marite near Bushbuckridge. Police arrested</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10 people, who are expected to appear in the Bushbuckridge magistrate's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">court on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Moosa said he would not apologise for not addressing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bushbuckridge residents because &quot;I was not invited to address any rally</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Bushbuckridge&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was instead scheduled to address a Workers Day rally at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roodepoort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Superintendent Setati said police were concerned about reports that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">police threatened journalists at the scene with physical violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Sunday Times correspondent was questioned by police for 30 minutes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">before being allowed to take photographs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalists, including an SABC radio news reporter who were standing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">away from the crowd, were fired at with teargas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One policeman shouted at me from a hippo that he would kick my balls</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">off if I took any more photographs,&quot; said correspondent, Leonard</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndzukhula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another policeman said he didn't care if I was a journalist, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that I had to leave because they were trying to get rid of all the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">kaffirs,&quot; Ndzukhula added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians have been accused of being responsible for the past</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">week's violence after three years of haggling over whether Mpumalanga</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">should exchange Groblersdal, Motetema, Tafelkop, Vaalbank and Marble</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hall for greater Bushbuckridge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the mean time, no local government elections have taken place in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">these towns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, the 40 000 residents from Bushbuckridge and the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">surrounding areas of Marite, Shatale, Dwarsloop, Thulamahashe, Casteel,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manyeleti, Acornhoek, Mkhuhlu and Matibite started two weeks of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">demonstrations, in an attempt to expedite their inclusion in Mpumalanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC regional chairperson, Freddy Mathebula said Bushbuckridge was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">supposed to have been included in Mpumalanga by the end of March, 1995,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">according to an agreement reached with the both provincial governments</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in September 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the ANC made a blunder when it tied the Groblersdal issue to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bushbuckridge. Now Groblersdal doesn't want to go to Northern Province</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Bushbuckridge also wants to go to Mpumalanga,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, Northern Province MEC for Local Government, John Dombo,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was stoned and shot at by Groblersdal residents demanding inclusion into</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpumalanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years ago, Northern Province Premier, Ngoako Ramatlhodi, was held</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hostage for more than eight hours by pro-Mpumalanga demonstrators in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bushbuckridge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was only released after Mpumalanga Premier Mathews Phosa flew in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and pledged to incorporate Bushbuckridge into his province.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on Friday afternoon after two large freight trucks were ambushed and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">burnt by pro-Mpumalanga demonstrators in the Marite area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The youths were part of a 2000 strong crowd in the peri-urban</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">settlement who are still demonstrating to demand that the region</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">immediately be transferred from Northern Province to Mpumalanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one was hurt in the ambush but damage to the trucks, from the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kiepersol Banana Farm near Hazyview, is estimated to be worth hundreds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of thousands of rands.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The youths are scheduled to appear in court on Monday, with protest</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">take to the street to show their solidarity with the youths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere in the greater Bushbuckridge region, thousands of residents</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">marched on police stations in Acornhoek, Thulamahashe, Marite, Mkhlulu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Bushbuckridge CBD to hand over memorandums accusing Constitutional</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Affairs minister Valli Moosa of &quot;blatant political betrayal&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insisting that it was unconstitutional for the government to link the</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gangs to fight crime had a setback when four prominent community leaders</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">refused to attend the launch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours before yesterday's ceremony, the four, who had been asked to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">monitor the initiative, had requested a postponement on the grounds that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it was &quot;premature&quot;, said businessman and former political activist Peter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jones, speaking on the group's behalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four community leaders had committed themselves to work for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;significant community peace&quot; and had been approached by Olympic bid</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">chief Chris Ball's team to monitor the initiative.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their refusal to take part in yesterday's launch at the Civic Centre</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was not a snub to the programme, Mr Jones said. &quot;It is not ominous. We</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are not ready,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have not fully satisfied ourselves as to the sustainability of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the initiative in the manner in which it is now being put forward and we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">think it is premature.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group consists of Mr Jones; Nombulelo Mkefa, chief executive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">director of the Community Peace Foundation; Matt Esau, a prominent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anglican cleric in Mitchell's Plain; and Gavin Pieterse, Western Cape</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">president of the Black Management Forum .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to understand fully what is being proposed and what it is we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are supposed to monitor, and the level of seriousness and commitment of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">all parties,&quot; Mr Jones said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At yesterday's launch there was an unlikely &quot;marriage in brothership&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">between Rashied Staggie, a gang leader who says he has reformed, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brian Williams, head of the Community Olympics Forum to make Cape Town a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">safer place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Williams denied any knowledge of the community leaders refusing to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">join the initiative because of the gangster element. At the ceremony,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the gangsters signed an agreement to help slash crime - starting with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the city centre - in the next few months in the run-up to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">announcement in September of the 2004 Olympic Games host city. The new</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">anti-crime initiative was put to the Cabinet in Pretoria this week, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Williams would not divulge details of the discussion and said it was</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Beth Shalom means &quot;house of peace&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was the name chosen by a remarkable young man called Stephen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith, when, in the autumn of 1995, he founded Europe's first dedicated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holocaust Memorial Centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Situated in a serene, sylvan setting on the edge of Sherwood Forest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Nottinghamshire, the centre provides a lasting and functional</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">memorial for the millions of Jews who died in the Nazi death camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Originally a Christian retreat, Beth Shalom was also conceived as a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">place where the Holocaust and its implications for humanity could be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">confronted by Jew and non-Jew alike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Beth Shalom is unique for another reason. It is also the world's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">first such museum to be conceptualised, established and run by a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gentile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unassuming and modest, dignified and articulate, 29-year-old Stephen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith explains how almost single-handedly he established what in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">almost two years of its existence has been universally acknowledged as a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">remarkable achievement for humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born in Derbyshire, Smith &quot;grew up in the coalfields in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nottinghamshire&quot; where he attended a local comprehensive school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he was about 13, his parents took him and his younger brother,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James, to Israel on a holiday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We went as a Christian family to discover the Holy Land, but while</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">we there we discovered that Judaism, which previously had been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">restricted to the Old Testament for us, was alive and well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The experience inspired Smith to embark on the study of theology and,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in particular, the relationship between Judaism and Christianity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It stimulated one big concern for me and that was the history and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">development of anti-Semitism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith then decided to research Christian theological responses to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holocaust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I felt that the Holocaust was a pivotal moment in this relationship,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which involved Jews as victims and Christians as perpetrators, this time</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with even more disastrous consequences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was at about this time that Stephen Smith and his brother James</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">visited Yad Vashem (the Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We went asking: 'What does the Holocaust mean to us as young people</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at the end of the 20th century?'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stunned by what they saw, the two men felt compelled to respond to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">what they had witnessed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I suppose we felt we couldn't see that, understand what was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">happening and then just go on with our lives as if we hadn't seen it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith returned to England, where he was struck by the abysmal lack of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">concern about the Holocaust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the help of his brother, he decided to do something himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a year at the Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith began his Ph D at Leeds University on &quot;the impact of the Holocaust</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on Christian thought and practice&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the years before Beth Shalom first opened, Smith had toured the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sites of the death camps as well as Holocaust institutions in Europe,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the United States and Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I felt this was important because there was little experience in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain on what to create and how to create it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was during this time that the vision for Beth Shalom began to take</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shape in his mind. After attending a four-week Holocaust educators'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">course at Yad Vashem, he held discussions with some Christian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">organisations and lay educators who &quot;failed to show any particular</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">interest&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was with &quot;little money and little hope&quot; that Smith eventually</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">turned to his family for a solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His parents had bought the 19th-century farmhouse in Sherwood Forest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in north Nottinghamshire and had set it up as a Christian retreat under</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a family charitable trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were more than happy to turn the place over to set up a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holocaust education centre.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Helped by his family and a handful of volunteers and with the modest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">family savings as well as the profits from his own confectionery</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">business, Smith established the $1,5-million (R6,7-m) project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idyllic setting, in the heart of Robin Hood country, sheltered as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it was from large urban centres, provided the perfect environment for a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commemorative and educational centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a strange combination, Robin Hood and the Holocaust, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">actually the rural setting and the tranquillity adds quite a powerful</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dimension to it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that it is not only provincial but rural, means that people</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have to make the effort to visit and when they do, they are usually</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ready to engage with the issues&quot;, says Smith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To counter the relative isolation of the centre, Beth Shalom runs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">three travelling exhibitions entitled Another Time, Another Place, which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tell the story of the Holocaust in a manner ideally suited to secondary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">school students approaching the subject for the first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Smith explains why he felt it important to seek financial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">assistance from individual donors and sponsors who were all exclusively</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">non-Jewish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In my reading of Holocaust literature, it became clear that the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">majority of people who were documenting the Holocaust were Jewish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's important because obviously it has a huge impact on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jewish community in this century and will have in the centuries to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But what concerned me was that there had been such a minimal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">response from outside the Jewish community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was very disappointed because society in general, and the church</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in particular, did not appreciate what the Holocaust was as a historical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">phenomenon,&quot; says Smith, who was brought up as a Methodist in a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">relatively religious home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I felt strongly that there should be a significant response to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holocaust from a Christian perspective. It was important for the Jewish</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">community to know that we cared about it; and that we cared enough to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">actually do something. But even more important was for non-Jews to see</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that other non-Jews cared about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During its first year, more than 20 000 schoolchildren visited the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">centre and Smith, who lectures in Holocaust studies at the centre, aims</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to reach many more in the years to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Beth Shalom is not just an education centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Smith: &quot;We want Beth Shalom to live up to its name, to be a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">house of peace for the sake of the survivors and victims.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">o Smith will be the main speaker at a Holocaust Remembrance Day</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">service at Pinelands Cemetery on Sunday at 11am.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The pessimism shown towards Sea Harvest on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg Stock Exchange was understandable but not justified,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">managing director Louis Penzhorn said at the release of the Cape fishing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">company's results yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Sea Harvest's share price tumbled to a low of 400c this week</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">against 525c at the beginning of the year, Mr Penzhorn said the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">company's business was stronger than ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company's results certainly reflect Mr Penzhorn's confidence with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">net profits rising 18 percent to R27,9 million in the six months to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Penzhorn attributes investor pessimism to the uncertainty with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">regard to fishing quotas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody was hoping that this year would produce some tangible</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">results and would bring a degree of finality for the industry - instead</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the industry remains in limbo,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the 1997 total allowable catch of hake was increased to 153 700</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tons, the entire industry has been allocated provisional quotas which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are four percent lower than last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Penzhorn said he was hopeful that Sea Harvest's quota would be set</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at a similar level as last year's once the Quota Board reviewed the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unallocated portion of this year's total allowable catch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Penzhorn remained confident for the company's long-term prospects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have just gone through a huge asset renewal programme and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">continue to diversify our portfolio.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company had just completed a R12,5-million upgrade at its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">processing plant in Hout Bay which was geared to producing seafood and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">other products based on non-quota fish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impact of the upgrade should start flowing through in the second</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">half of the financial year, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We also made a very important investment in an abalone (perlemoen)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">farm 20km east of Port Elizabeth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it would take three to four years to show a return on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investment because &quot;abalone take that long to grow&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They would be sold mainly on the export markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Penzhorn said most of the investment in new vessels and in</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in a general election which has attracted the interest of governments</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and political analysts throughout the world</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain's decline as a world power has tended to obscure the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">country's contemporary contribution to social and economic change around</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the world. It was, for example, the country which conceived and launched</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">privatisation and which was the first to begin to fundamentally</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">challenge the socialist precepts of organised labour and Marxist</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ideology which have so pervasively influenced the world for the greater</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">part of the century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For South Africa, and many other countries which now face the painful</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">transformation that comes with privatisation, welfare reform and budget</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">austerity and which have hitched their wagons to the concept of a market</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">driven economy, yesterday's general election in Britain holds much</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">interest. For the first time in 18 years of momentous change, a new</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government with a new outlook and ethos is in charge of a country which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">played a pioneering role in changing the way modern societies organise</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new British government faces daunting problems that are products</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of this change, and how it deals with them will be of compelling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">relevance to South Africa and other countries which in many important</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">respects have followed the British lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extent to which the new Labour Party government will influence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's fortunes in the field of investment and trade could also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">be significant. It has a longer and closer relationship with South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's ruling party than its predecessor did; it also has a more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">constructive approach to Britain's role in the European Union. These are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">encouraging portents for South Africa, which potentially stands to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">benefit from the change in Whitehall and which also needs friends and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">influence in Europe at this critical stage of its development.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Ethio-American Post-War Relations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We saw last week that Ethiopia's Post-World War II Relations with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain were far from satisfactory, and the Emperor, in the mid 1940s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reduced his contacts with that country. Now read on:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Post-War Reconstruction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1940s and early 1950s constituted an important period of post-war</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reconstruction. Decrees designed for the most part to bring the entire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">country under centralised, and standardised, administration, were issued</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as early as 10 March 1942. Dealing with a wide variety of subjects,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">including significantly enough taxation, they were from that date</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">published regularly, in the Negarit Gazeta, of official gazette. They</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bore the signature of the Minister of the Pen, or official writer of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">proclamations, which gave them the stamp of imperial authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Roosevelt at Bitter Lake</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Development, as the years went by, were based on steadily increasing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American economic, military, and other assistance. Ethiopian ties with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the United States were symbolised by a meeting between the Emperor and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Roosevelt, held by the Suez Canal Bitter Lake at the beginning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of 1945. The British Minister in Addis Ababa, Robert Howe, hearing the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emperor's Egypt-bound aeroplane flying over his legation, before day-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">light, at once investigated the cause of the unusual noise. Ascertaining</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">what this was, and perhaps fearing an Ethiopian opening to the United</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">States, he commissioned a small 'plane to pursue the monarch to Egypt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Bank of Ethiopia, Ethiopian Airlines, and American Silver</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Post-war Ethiopian contacts with the United States had in fact</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">started three years earlier. A new government bank, the State Bank of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia, established in 1942, was run at first by an American governor,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Blowers. A new national currency, inaugurated in 1945, owed its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">successful introduction to the United States. The latter provided the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">silver needed to mint 50 cent coins, whose intrinsic value ensured</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">popular acceptance of thenew paper money. The country's first national</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">air services, Ethiopian Airlines, at first almost entirely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americanmanned, was set up in close collaboration with the American</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">carrier Trans World Airlines, in 1946.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Imperial Highway Authority American financial assistance made</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">possible the establishment of an Imperial Highway Authority, IHA. Funded</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with assistance from the American-sponsored International Bank for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reconstruction and Development, IBRD, it restored old and built many new</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Important Landmark An important landmark in Ethio-American</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">relations was the signing by the two countries, on 22 May 1953, of a 25-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">year Treaty of Amity and Economic Relations. This provided inter alia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for an American communications base, the Kagnew base as it was called,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">just outside Asmara, which was by then under Ethiopian rule. Training of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopian soldiers, by a British Military Mission to Ethiopia, BMME,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">withdrawn in 1951, was carried out, after 1953, by an American Military</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistance Advisory Group, MAAG. American staff, including deans, were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">prominent in the country's institution of higher learning, Haile</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sellassie I University, in educational development and planning, through</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the United States Point Four Program, and in secondary school teaching,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">through the US Peace Corps. The majority of Ethiopian students studying</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">abroad, including many members of the military, went to the United</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">States, and Ethiopian soldiers fought, under American command, in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Korean War, of 1950-3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continuing, though perhaps less consistently than in Menilek's day,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia's old policy of avoiding dependence on any one foreign power,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haile Sellassie's government also made use of foreign assistance, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">expertise, from other lands. The Air Force, the Imperial Bodyguard,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">telecommunications, and schoolbuilding, were thus entrusted to Swedes,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the police to Germans and Israelis, planning to Yugoslavs, and the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">country's principal Military Academy, at Harar, to Indians. Teachers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from the sub-continent were also extensively employed, particularly in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Educational Developments This period witnessed many promising</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">developments in the educational sector. These included the re-opening of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pre-war schools, and the establishment of many new ones. The most</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">prestigious schools in the capital were the Haile Sellassie I Secondary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">School, founded in 1943, and the General Orde Wingate Secondary School,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in 1946. Useful teaching was also given at vocational schools, for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commerce, handicrafts, and technology Education, contrary to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">situation prior to the war, was now extremely popular. Almost every</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">school had a waiting list for new student intake. The Emperor, when</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">driving in his car, was frequently mobbed by children crying, &quot;School!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">school!&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increasing numbers of students were sent for study abroad, mainly to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">English speaking countries: first to Britain, and later to the United</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">States, Canada, and India. The growth of secondary education made</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">possible the establishment, in 1950, of the country's first institution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of higher learning, the University College of Addis Ababa. This</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">educational establishment was later merged with other colleges,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">specialising in agriculture, building, commerce, engineering, public</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">health, technology, and theology, to form the nucleus of Haile Sellassie</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I University, established in 1961 (later renamed Addis Ababa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It subsequently also comprised colleges of business administration,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">education, law, and medicine, a school of social work, and Institutes of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopian Studies, Patho-Biology, and Development Research. The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University's administraion, and some of the faculties, were housed in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the former Imperial Palace, and its well-kept grounds, which the Emperor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">donated for the purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two New Hospitals A number of new hospitals were also established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most presigious was the country's first modern teaching hospital,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">named after the Emperor's daughter, Princess Tsahay, who had served as a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nurse in Britain in 1940, during the London Blitz. This institution,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">founded in 1951, was funded by international subscription, mainly in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain. A Russian Red Cross hospital was also set up, named after</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dajazmach Balcha, who had fought at Adwa, and later in the patriotic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">resistance to the fascist occupation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent statistics of the US Department of Commerce reveal that US</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">trade with Ethiopia show a positive trend in both import and export of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commodities. Mr. Whitaker, Sr. Economic/commercial officer told the</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exported industrial goods to Ethiopia for the most part, during the time</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">period of 1992-1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The said statistics also showed that Ethiopia imports from the US</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">such as parts of aeroplanes or helicopters, of boring or sinking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">machinery and soybean have slightly increased. On the other hand,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commodities like fertilisers, wheat, flour, milk and articles donated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for relief, etc. are imported less in the year 1996 when compared to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">previous four years. It is also noted that during the years 1992-1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the US had not imported from Ethiopia such commodities like wine, bed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">linen of cotton, basket work, wicket work, and as well as statuettes and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">other ornaments of wood etc. But the year 1996 saw the United States</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">importing the said items in a small quantity. The years 1994,1995 saw a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">great increase in the US importing sheep/lamb skins from Ethiopia but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">there was a slight decrease in such items in the year 1996. And</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Kenya Airways Logo says, &quot;Kenya Airways, the Pride of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa.&quot; There is a new enthusiasm at Kenya Airways. Mr. David Tenai,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">area manager Ethiopia, Djibouti and Eritrea talked to Addis Tribune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The area manager said &quot; Kenya Airways traces it's history back to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1946 with the formation of East African Airways Corporation, jointly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">owned by the Governments of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. Shortly after</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the collapse of the East African Community in 1976, East Africa Airways</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was placed under liquidation and it's operations came to an end on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">January 31, 1977.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added &quot;Kenya Airways was incorporated on January 22, 1977 as a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wholly owned government corporation and the flag carrier of the Republic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of Kenya. The first Kenya Airways commercial flight originated from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London on the evening of February 4, 1977 arriving Nairobi Airport the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">following morning. Since then it has continued to operate international,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intra-Africa and domestic routes in and out of Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International Airport.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is with pride that this year, the airline celebrates 20 years of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">continuous operation since it's inception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr. Tenai, &quot;The airline's primary service is to provide</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">air transport for passengers, cargo and mail. The airline is also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">involved in freighting business through it's fully owned subsidiary,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya Air freight Handling Limited, which started operations on April 1,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1978.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya Airways launched it's operations with a fleet of seven aircraft</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- 3 Boeing 707 - 320B's, 2 Fokker 27's, 1 Boeing 720B and 1 McDonnell</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Douglas DC9-30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current fleet consists of 3 Airbus A310-300's, 2 Boeing 737-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">200's, 3 Fokker 50's and the latest addition 1 Boeing 737-300 which was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">delivered on March 27, 1997. The second Boeing 737-300 is expected in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mid May while a third will arrive in May 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new aircraft (pictured) has since been deployed to operate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi-Addis- Nairobi on Tuesdays and Fridays offering convenient</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">connections beyond Nairobi to destination worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The airline turned into profitability at the end of the 1992/93</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">financial year declaring a historic Kshs 237 million (USD 3.6m) profit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the following year, the figure rose to Kshs 662 million (USD 10.1m) and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for the 1994/95 financial year, the airline realized profits of Kshs 886</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">million (USD 16.9m). Profits doubled for the year 1995/96 recording a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">resounding Kshs 1.3 million (USD 24.5m).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This renewed financial health gave the company impetus for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">privatization and assured would-be investors that Kenya Airways was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">indeed worth their money. The birth of the partnership with KLM in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">January 1996 proved indeed that Kenya Airways was a worthwhile buy. The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">airline is now owned 23% by the Kenya Government, 26% by KLM and 51% by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the public who include international investors, major institutions and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the airline's staff in their private capacities and also through a unit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">trust which ensures that each permanent employee owns a minimum of 200</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The airline now has in excess of 110,000 shareholders, the largest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">number in East Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya Airways became the first airline in sub-Saharan Africa to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">attempt transfer of ownership from government to private interests, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">manage successfully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. David Tenai didn't hide that the partnership with KLM gives Kenya</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Airways the opportunity to take it's place in a global alliance of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">airlines providing connections around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From April 1997, Kenya Airways and KLM will be operating joint code</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shares services to and within Africa. this heralds the first stage of a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">long-term strategy to build Nairobi as a world class aviation hub.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Africa and many parts of the world Kenya Airways and KLM are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">setting up joint sales offices, making it even more convenient for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">passengers. These exciting developments means that the pace of change</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will increase over the next few years, hopefully leading to improved</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">business performance and added value to investment made by over 110,000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shareholders during the privatization process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The area manager was enthusiastic sharing his views about the Kenya</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Airways frequent flier programme. Msafiri club, which has now been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">integrated with KLM's successful Flying Dutchman Programme, allowing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">members to enjoy a large variety of special packages, discounts and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">privileges on KLM and her airline and non-airline partners. Former</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Msafiri members are now able to earn points on all Kenya Airways - KLM</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">services and enjoy benefits accruing from frequent travelling including</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">free tickets, upgrades and travel awards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Tenai said, &quot;KLM airline partners include America's Northwest,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain's Air UK, Air Excel and Transavia Airlines while non-airline</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">partners include Inter-Continental hotels, ITT Sheraton, Golden Tulip</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hotels, Avis Car Hire and Amsterdam Airport Shopping Centre.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The special deal involves accumulation of travel points as one</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">purchases air tickets. The number of accumulated points groups members</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">into three categories offering different levels of benefits.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The general election is over, and Britain has a new</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government. I have been asked how far the election result will affect</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia. My opinion is that the result will have only the most marginal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of effect. Nothing, as the saying goes, &quot;to write home about&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One must also take account of the fact that British foreign policy is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">largely framed by the permanent civil service, by the Foreign Office. It</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is only on particularly major issues, that a change of government</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">results in any significant shift in actual policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Historically, as far as Ethiopia is concerned, both parties have had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a poor record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fascist Invasion, 1935-6</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of the Italian fascist invasion, the Conservative</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government was extremely unhelpful to the Ethiopian cause. To cite but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">one example, on 10 September 1935, less than a month before the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">beginning of hostilities, the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Samuel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hoare, met the French leader Pierre Laval, with a view to avoid giving</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">any practical assistance to Ethiopia. Laval later informed the French</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chamber of Deputies that he and Hoare had found themselves</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;instantaneously in agreement upon ruling out military sanctions, not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">adopting any measure of a naval blockade, and never contemplating the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">closure of the Suez Canal - in a word, ruling out everything that might</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lead to war&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Publicly, however, Sir Samuel spoke in very different voice. On the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">day after the talks he declared, in an address to the League of Nations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assembly: &quot;His Majesty's Government and the British people maintain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their support of the League and its ideals as the most effective way of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ensuring peace... this belief in the necessity of preserving the League</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is our sole interest in the present controversy... The ideals enshrined</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the Covenant, and in particular the aspiration to establish the rule</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of law in international affairs, have appealed... with growing force to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the strain of idealism which has its place in our national character,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and they have become part of our national conscience... The League</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stands, and my country stands with it, for the collective maintenance of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">theCovenant (of the League) in its entirety, and particularly for steady</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and collective resistance to all acts of unprovoked aggression... This</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is no variable and unreliable sentiment, but a principle of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">international conduct to which they (the British people) and their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government hold with firm, enduring and universal persistence&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Italian anti-fascist historian, Gaetano Salvemini, later aptly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commented that, if the secret agreement between Laval and Hoare had been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">known, the latter's speech &quot;would have been greeted with a tempest of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">boos and hisses&quot;, but, not being known, &quot;met with an immense ovation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no need to go into the events which followed: Britain's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">insistence on ineffective League of Nations Sanctions against the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">invader; the Hoare-Laval Pact, at the end of 1935, which would have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">partitioned Ethiopia, to Mussolini's advantage; British recognition, in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1938, of the Italian fascist conquest of Ethiopia, and of the King of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Italy as Emperor of Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain, one should never forget, subsequently played a decisive role</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Ethiopia's Liberation, in 1941. However, British intervention would</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not have taken place were it not for Mussolini's entry into the European</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">war, in June 1940. The subsequent British occupation of Ethiopia was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">moreover in from altruistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bevin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Conservative Britain failed Ethiopia, in 1935-8, Labour Britain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was no less of a disappointment. It was the Labour Foreign Secretary,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ernest Bevin, who, in the summer of 1946, proposed that Ethiopia should</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">surrender of the Ogaden, and that the territory should be placed under</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British Trusteeship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was Bevin too, who, in a letter of 31 January 1949, brushed off</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">any British responsibility for assisting Ethiopia in the trial of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fascist War Criminals, and thus, in effect, derailed the course of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Aksum Obelisk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as the recent agitation for the return of the Aksum obelisk is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">concerned, it is worthy of note that the Conservative, Sir Bernard</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Braine, strongly supported restitution. He declared it &quot;incredible&quot; that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;a civilised country like Italy should have turned a deaf ear to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pleas from Ethiopia for the return of the obelisk&quot;. A Labour Member of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the European Parliament. Richard Balfe, later raised the matter in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruxelles, on 2 October 1992, and was told that the &quot;question does not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fall within the competence of the Community&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question was more recently raised with the British Foreign and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commonwealth.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - In Addis Ababa there are at least two broad categories</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of people: those who have money in varying amounts but cannot start up</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">businesses of various types and scales because of bureaucratic and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">infastructural difficulties and bottlenecks; and those who have no money</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">but are willing to start up businesses provided they can find the money</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and the bureaucratic and infrastructural facilities needed for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the scarcity of start-up capital and the bureaucratic and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">infrastructural difficulties could quite legitimately be blamed on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">incompetence of existing government institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why scare away potential investors with bureaucratic inefficiency?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">why not build the basic infrastructures expected of any government at a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">faster pace? Why not help organize and develop capital markets, which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">function is also expected of government, especially in developing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">countries?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The root problem behind this seems to be lack of vision and creative</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and adaptive thinking on the part of government institutions. In turn,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this may well be attributable to lack of awareness or knowledge of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dynamics of economic development. Economic development is a function of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the production of goods and services. The production of goods and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">services is itself a function of the factors of production, namely land,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">labour, capital and enterprise. Paper and coin money was introduced</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">essentially to facilitate the exchange of goods and services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody who has not, to begin with, produced a good or a service can</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">really claim to have earned money. Outside this, the only other legal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ways one can have earned money are through inheritance, gifts and grants</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and credit. The illegal way, as everybody knows, is through stealing of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">one kind or another. He or she who has, through savings, managed to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">accumulate a certain amount of money can legitimately earn money as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">interest or profits, the latter when the accumulated money is somehow</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">invested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Addis Ababa, one can observe several economic paradoxes. People</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">who possess invisible funds incessantly complain about the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unavailability of land, but there are estimated to be 30,000 hectares or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">300,000,000 square meters of idle land in the city!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This difficulty is a direct result of the inefficiency of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government bureaucracy. The shortage of infrustructural facilities such</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as water, electricity, telephone services roads, etc., is also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">attributable to bureaucratic incompetence, because in some of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">critical sectors the rate of implementation of the public sector</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investment programme is sometimes as low as 20 percent!  With respect</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to the problem of developing money and capital markets, the government's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">role so far, especially in the promotion of the development of micro</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">credits, is minuscule. In the area of developing human skills and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">entrepreneurship specifically tailored to income generation, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government's track-record has been quite dismal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let us briefly see what could be done in Addis to improve the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">situation. We shall attempt to broadly address each problem area</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">separately. The problem of land unavailability could be tackled through</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a three-tier organizational structure composed of the municipality of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa, &quot;Wereda&quot; administrations and &quot;Kebele&quot; offices. The use of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the 30,000 hectares of idle land in Addis would be identified according</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the city's master plan and detailed land use plans. Then four mechanisms</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for land distribution may be adopted, namely sale by auction, lease by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">auction grant; by lottery and grants as partial compensating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All major land transactions through the above-cited mechanisms would</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">be handled at &quot;Wereda&quot; levels subject to approval by the headquarters at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Municipality of Addis Ababa. Minor land transactions such as land</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">grants for group or individual low-cost housing on the outskirts of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa may be taken care of at &quot;Kebele&quot; levels subject to &quot;Wereda&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To bybass the deadweight past inefficiency in the Municipality of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa, a new land distribution and administration authority may be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">set up anew as an alternative with the same three-tier administrative</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">structure. In addition to the function of distributing land through the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">four mechanisms mentioned above, the three-tier organizational</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">structure would also handle matters associated with the issuance of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">title deeds and detailed construction blueprints according to the city's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">master and detailed land use and development plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Land reforms along the lines indicated above would increase the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">demand for credit substantially. Loans for the construction of apartment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">buildings, high-rise offices, villas and houses would rise very</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">significantly; So would loans and credits for tree planting, animal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">breeding, horticulture and cottage and small-scale industries. Loans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would also be greatly demanded for the construction of medium- and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">large-scale factory houses, store houses and other physical structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to this huge increase in the demand for credit capital,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">existing banks would expand their branch networks and new private banks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would be opened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big and medium-size investors would have little difficulty getting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">access to bank credit, but small investors would, for reasons that are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">only too well-known, would not be so fortunate. Hence, the need for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">promoting micro-credit institutions. A beginning has already been made</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in this direction through the issuance of a proclamation governing the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">establishment and operation of micro-financing institutions. However,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the response on the part of private investors in this field has so far</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been practically nil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been reported that this lack of response has been due to some</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rather restrictive clauses in the proclamation, including those related</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to the cap on the lending interest rate and re-registration obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the establishment of private mini - banks should be assiduously</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pursued through relaxing the said restrictive clauses, small investors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are in the meantime likely to find other means of financing their micro-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">enterprises, including &quot;ekubs&quot; , provided the basic problem of land</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unavailability is solved satisfactorily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be interesting to witness that a major breakthrough in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">real sector in the form of a progressive land reform would spur</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">activities in the financial sector geared to expanding the supply of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">credit capital, which, as we have pointed out above, is a crucial factor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Entreprneureship and skills are the other major component of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">group of factors of production that are in short supply in Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Land and capital may be available, but without enterprise and skills to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">deploy these factors in the production of goods and services, they would</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">be quite useless. Commercial farming, large and medium -scale non -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">agricultural enterprises and small- scale and cottage industries cannot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">be established and run without entrepreneurship and specialized human</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">skills what can be done to expand thee supply enterpreneurship and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">specialized human skills in the short- and medium-term in an effective</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">manner? This question may be more appropriately posed to the Ministry of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">education in a slightly modified form as follows: a breakthrough has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">just been made on the problem of land unavailability. In response, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">availability of credit capital has improved very significantly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, although people now realize the great opportunity for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">starting all types of businesses and enterprises, they lack the basic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">entrepreneurial expertise and skills required for such ventures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Particularly for Addis Ababa, the following major fields of know-how and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">skills are required in the short-term: tree farming; animal breeding;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">horticulture; bee-keeping; carpentry; masonry; bricklaying; glass work,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cabinet-making; plumbing; electrical work; metal works; automechanics;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tailoring; house painting; cooking; hotel and restaurant management;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">business project identification, analysis and appraisal; business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">management; basic accounting and book-keeping, etc;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what effective and expeditious way can the Ministry of Education</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">respond to this immediate challenge of a hugely increasing demand for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">practical know-how and skills? Let the Ministry of Education and Higher</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Education Commission handle that question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bureaucratic and infrastructural problems are intertwined as most</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">basic economic infrastructures are provided by the state bureaucracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facilities where immediate improvements are needed are water,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">electricity telecommunications and road construction and maintenance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here capital budgets should continue to increases substantially in real</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">terms and implementation rates should exceed 90 percent. All in all, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investment climate in Addis would be considered satisfactory if, for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">example, an Ethiopian micro-entrepreneur in the field of horticulture</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">could expedite the process leading to the commencement of a small fruits</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a grassroots small-scale or micro-entrepreneur could be assisted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as indicated above, there would be very little doubt that big investors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would be given similar, if not better, treatment. And this would be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">perhaps the only way one can assess and ensure the practical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">effectiveness of the Ethiopian bureaucracy. Of course, such efficient</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">effectiveness of the Ethiopian bureaucracy should be matched by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">scrupulous integrity to be brought about through the employment of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">transparent procedures and the principle of accountability. Let every</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is the only reliable path to significant economic prosperity in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the shortest time possible! The choice is ours and ours only, whether to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">languish in the grimy clutches of poverty or to battle our way out on</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - 'The boat, all 42 tons of it, was picked up</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by a wave and literally thrown over the next wave to land</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">flat, down on her side. But she picked up and off we went</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that, in Hurricane Fergus in the Pacific, just three</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">days from Wellington, New Zealand, with the wind gusting up to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">70 knots, was both the most frightening and best experience so</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">far of the BT Global Challenge race for South African Boris</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Webber. Indeed, of his entire sailing career.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And for the 31-year-old Webber, who is skippering</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courtaulds International, the race itself, which involves 14</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">identical 67-foot steel yachts sailing around the world from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">east to west against the prevailing winds and currents, is the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fulfilment of another on the list of the goals that he has set</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">himself since he started sailing in Port Elizabeth at the age</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in Cape Town during the three-week stopover there,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">just a few days before the start of the penultimate leg of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">race to Boston, USA, he explained how he came to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Challenge, with experience including the 1979 Cape to Uruguay</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">race at the age of 14, and in 1985 another Cape to Uruguay</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">race and the doublehanded Round Britain race, both with John</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin on Voortrekker 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After completing mechanical engineering at Port Elizabeth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Technikon, he did the 1993 Cape to Rio race, and finding that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;the sailing bug had bitten again&quot;, then moved to the UK with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a view to getting into the sailing scene there. This proved</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">more difficult than he expected, however, but after several</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;lean&quot; months working in boatyards he met Mike Golding,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">skipper of race entrant Group 4, who in turn introduced him to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chay Blyth, who runs the Challenge Business. He has been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">working for the Business ever since, initially doing charter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">work and now the Challenge itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the event so far Webber said that while he had initially</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pushed hard, it soon became evident that the crew members were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">there to learn as much as possible from the experience and so</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">his philosophy has been to sail perhaps somewhat</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">overcautiously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lying 13th overall at the Cape Town stopover, Courtaulds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has also had her share of bad luck, with a broken spinnaker</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pole in the first leg and then a broken bottlescrew in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">last leg, which resulted in having to sail most of it under</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">jury rig. There have also been numerous crew changes as people</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have left for one or other reason, and this has &quot;set us back</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">quite badly&quot;, said Webber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out of the original crew of 12, only five are still aboard,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">while by the end of the race there will have been no less than</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">40 crew members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless the core crew are very motivated to do well -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as attested by a third place in the Wellington-Sydney leg and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the fact that they were in the lead for the first week out of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sydney until the bottlescrew went - and Webber anticipates two</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">good legs to get up into the middle of the fleet by the time</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the race ends in Southampton in July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Webber said the race has also provided a &quot;huge learning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">curve&quot; in terms of people management and he has a feeling of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;paternal pride&quot; in seeing the growth and achievements of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">crew. He said the hardest part has been to hide his own fears</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and put on a brave front in the worst conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would he do the race again? &quot;When I arrived in Cape Town I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said definitely not,&quot; Webber commented, but yes, he would like</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to do the 2000 race - but as a South African entry with local</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sponsors and full local crew. He also insists that the crew</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">must be mixed so that it is not seen merely as a &quot;white,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">elitist&quot; event, and he has laid the seeds for this by speaking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of his experiences to over 3 000 schoolchildren during the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town stopover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Webber sees sailing as an ideal management training vehicle</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and when his contract with the Challenge Business expires in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">September, he would like to get involved in this field. But in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the longer term, he said, his ambition is to come back to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa and establish sailing as a training base for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">inner-city children and youth in general. These sorts of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">activities are beginning to happen in the UK and Europe - in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France, sailing is part of the school curriculum, he pointed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">out - and it would be &quot;a way of putting back into sailing what</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have got out of it&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next leg of the BT Global Challenge to Boston begins on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday, with Group 4 in first place on overall elapsed time,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">almost a day ahead of second-placed Toshiba. Joining</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Courtaulds for the leg - and, he says, hopefully for the rest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the race - is Capetonian Lytton Coomer, who is filling a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gap after a sudden crew departure due to a family bereavement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coomer, who is also an old friend of Webber's, is a regular</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sailor with his own yacht but this will be his first ocean</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">voyage and he is &quot;fired up&quot; for it, he says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - SOMEONE, somewhere must have the answer to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the conundrum of South African sides failing to go the</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If they do, it's not the South African coaches. The</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">already been sanctioned and no further action is to be taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of Van der Westhuizen, this is patently a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nonsense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But these rules exist and the strict adherence to the book</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by the Australians and New Zealanders may well have been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rooted in the fact that they have been less than happy with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">some of the interpretations by South African referees on their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">away trips here. But they have largely accepted them as just</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">one of the many facets of a complex game; rub of the green if</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">you like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More importantly, the Aussies and Kiwis understand that in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the intensity of a competition as fierce as Super 12, you have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to aim at playing beyond the stipulated 80 minutes in much the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">same way as a top athlete in the 100m dash mentally sets the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tape at 110m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Natal's 39-17 defeat at the hands of Auckland provides a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">glaring example of this. They were well in the game for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">first hour - indeed, Kevin Putt's interception provided the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">first try of the afternoon - but then succumbed to the flood</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of Auckland power in the last 20 minutes. History should have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shown the South Africans that this is a trademark of All Black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rugby. They never stop playing until they have their boots off</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the dressing room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Natal more than most should remember the ignominy of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">surrendering Super 12 matches to Auckland and Queensland at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">home last season in the dying minutes of both games that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">certainly cost them home-ground advantage in the final and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">surely cost them the encounter with Auckland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This weekend, Natal take on Queensland in Brisbane in a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">match that promises to be every bit as tough and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">uncompromising as the meeting with Auckland last Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australians lie at the foot of the log and are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">desperate to pass the wooden spoon on to Otago, who have a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">two-point edge at present. Natal, on the other hand, currently</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lie in fourth place on the log behind Auckland and ACT on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">level points at 27 with Wellington, but well adrift on points</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Auckland game is one that Natal would have budgeted to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lose in their pre-campaign planning. Beating the Blues at home</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is an ideal to strive for, but hardly a bankable commodity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sharks can make no such concessions against Queensland. To</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stay within reach of the leaders, they have to go full out for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">maximum points against Queensland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More especially as Wellington, one of the real form sides</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the competition, have a home assignment against a New South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wales side still reeling from the 56-9 thumping they were on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the wrong end of against the ACT Brumbies in their last</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">outing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equally, the Gauteng Lions have a tough task. Hit by a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">veritable raft of injuries that seems to be their lot, no</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">matter what the team is called - remember Transvaal's walking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wounded tour last season? - they face a Waikato side nursing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the same variety of lower-table wounds as Queensland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng still have a slim outside chance of making the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">four-team semi-finals, but as things stand at present that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will depend more on a total Natal collapse than on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">realistically challenging the other three sides currently in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the top four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At home, Northern Transvaal seem finally to be firing on at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">least 90% of their cylinders after a disastrous start to a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">season that has included player revolts, coaching shenanigans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and the spectre of an administration that is telling them how</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to play when it cannot keep the union's books in order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Blue Bulls face Canterbury at Loftus Versfeld in a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">match that brings them both into the fray on 16 points. But</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Crusaders have recently upped their act to a level where,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">while they might not start favourites in the thin Highveld</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">winter air, certainly doesn't make them rank outsiders to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">produce an upset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No team that owns the kicking talents of an Andrew Mehrtens</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and a pack as mobile and committed as Canterbury can ever be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">taken lightly. And, like all the sides from the Land of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long White Cloud, they will play through the full passage of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the game as if there was nothing more they wanted than to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">continue for another 80.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surely - after the four years of competition if you include</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the old Super 10 - we must have learnt something about the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">effectiveness of this philosophy from our opponents?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then again, perhaps not.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - HAVING travelled with Bafana Bafana to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pointe Noire to experience the inexplicable outbreak of &quot;Congo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fever&quot; which saw the locals' confidant 2-0 predictions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">transformed eerily into reality, it was quite clear that there</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">were &quot;darker&quot; forces at play. A simple stroll around the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">murkier corners of the local market and a once-over of some of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the more inscrutable characters doing the rounds inside the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal Stadium was enough to convince one of that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like their neighbours across the Congo River, the Zaireans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are also renowned for their unorthodox - at least by European</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">standards - preparations for football matches and in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">particular their opponents. Fortunately last Sunday's crucial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">away match against Zaire was moved from Kinshasa to Lome in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Togo because of the civil war. There was therefore no need to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">worry about the local population doing all they could to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unsettle the team. But there was still the thorny issue of</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">those &quot;darker&quot; forces to deal with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Qualifying for the World Cup is serious business which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">relies essentially on co- operation and teamwork. Upon arrival</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Togo I decided that my contribution to Bafana Bafana's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">flagging campaign would be to ensure that in Togo at least,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the gods would be on our side. Clive Barker and his team may</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">believe that it was they who beat Zaire on Sunday but if you</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would care to read on I shall reveal the true reasons for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vodun - perhaps the best known of Africa's traditional</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">religions - has its origins in Togo and neighbouring Benin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from whence it spread, through slavery, to establish itself in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the new world and become better known as voodoo in places like</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haiti, Cuba, Brazil and America. Clandestine channels of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">inquiry finally led us - myself and accomplice Peter Auf der</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heyde, editor of Soccer News - to the domain of Polo Kuma, a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">powerful voodoo priest of the Ewe people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polo Kuma was absent, called away to heal a sick relative,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">but the eldest son, Polo Kodzo, was at home. Bafana Bafana</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">were in luck. Polo Kodzo was the voodoo priest who accompanied</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Togolese national team to Zimbabawe for their World Cup</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">qualifier in January. What was the score? Togo lost 3- 0! It</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would have been seven or eight if not for him, claimed one of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">his adherents. We decide to give him the benefit of the doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe voodoo doesn't travel too well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like everybody else in Togo, Kodzo was aware that Bafana</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bafana were playing in Lome and like everybody else he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">appeared to hold a favourable disposition towards the African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">champions. Even voodoo priests appreciate good football it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would seem. We were invited into his shrine to see whether the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ancestors and trowo - intermediaries of the High God, Mawu -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would agree to intercede on behalf of Bafana Bafana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were two large, dome-shaped oracles in the corner of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the shrine covered with cloths. Kodzo's divination with the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ancestors followed the same pattern throughout. He took a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">small bowl from a larger bowl containing a dark liquid at his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">feet and balanced it on his outstretched palm. The small bowl</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fell back into the larger one and the divination proceeded if</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the ancestors were satisfied. After much tumbling and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">splashing it was apparent the ancestors would be only too</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">happy to assist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only one problem. Powerful charms would be needed to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">overcome the muti that Zaire had already put on the pitch at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Eyadema Stadium. Having arrived three days earlier than</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa, Zaire were the first to train on the field and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">they had already doctored it with powerful juju of their own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More consultation with the ancestors fixed a price of 57 305</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CFA - just over $100 - but time was of the essence. A little</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">more than 24 hours remained to the game and many medicines had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to be bought and preparation would take a long time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A quick taxi trip back to the hotel and Thomas Kwenaite of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Sunday Times was convinced to part with the cash -I can</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">only assume his travel allowance is much bigger than mine. How</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he was refunded shall only be revealed at the next Pickard</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission of Enquiry! After several hours of waiting at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polo shrine all the ingredients arrived, including eight</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">trussed but unsuspecting chickens and roosters. It was not an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">evening for the squeamish as blood flowed liberally in each of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the three different shrines and incantations were made against</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the names of several prominent Zaire players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Auf asked for a scoreline of 2-1 but I, ever mindful of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">goal difference, got greedy and went for 2-0. That Auf and not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">myself was more in tune with the ancestors became apparent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">when we returned to the hotel to the news that his sister in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">law had just given birth to twins - the greatest blessing that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">can be bestowed on an individual in Ewe culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following morning we returned to fetch the muti for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">player rm oots - three different plants, one of which looked</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">distinctly like the seeds from a herb popular with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rastafarians - and finish the preparations for the fetish</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which would go with Kodzo's accomplice, Polo Komi, to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Auf sprinkled the green dust on the players boots as they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">went out to thanks the ancestors demanded we show our</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">appreciation in a more off- up while I ushered Komi - who had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">somehow conjured his way onto the field - to the Zairean</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bench. Satisfied that he had left his spell there I placed him</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">behind the South African goal for the game. Those of you who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">watched on television may think the 2-1 scoreline came about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by mere chance, but of course you didn't see the hand of Mawu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tip Ndombasi's injury-time shot on to the post or hold Phil</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Masinga back so that he was side when Eric Tinkler's shot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">screamed into the net after 90 seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes you have every right to be sceptical but Danny Jordaan,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">newly appointed chief executive officer of the South African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Football Association, was suitably impressed to join us after</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the match in thanking Mawu and the ancestors at the Polo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shrine. As we sat and gav er tangible form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordaan emptied his pockets and offered approximately R120</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in local currency. It was not enough. The little bowl would</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not fall from Kodzo's palm. It finally dropped when the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bidding reached R800. Jordaan whispered in my ear, &quot;I didn't</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">know the ancestors were capitalists!&quot; But then the ancestors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">were on the side of their kin in these negotiations and we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">eventually agreed that should Bafana Bafana qualify for France</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">we would send triple the amount through the South African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Embassy in Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obviously fully conversant with the concept of &quot;A bird in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the hand is worth two in the bush,&quot; the ancestors weren't too</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">keen on that idea he views expressed in this article do not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">necessarily reflect those of but they reluctantly agreed when</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a signed Bafana Bafana jersey was offered to keep them warm at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">night. But when the president of the Togolese Federation began</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">his speech at the post match function with the words, &quot;Your</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">victory is not yours alone. It is also ours,&quot; I knew staright</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">away that he too had been talking to the ancestors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EADLINE the author or Safa. Any queries or complaints should</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">be directed to Mawu, far away in the invisible sky above Togo.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">frequency with which both defences were split open in Lom'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The loud and prolonged cry from South African supporters</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">before the match was for a more attacking approach, a fair</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">enough request considering only one goal had been scored in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the previous four matches. This plea also had its origins in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the disastrous events that unfolded in the Congo, where a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">combination of naked intimidation, overly defensive tactics</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and a lack of commitment led to a humiliating two-goal loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coach Clive Barker, whose strangely timed pre-match comment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that he might quit after the qualifiers even if South Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">won Group 3, was probably a knee-jerk reaction to some ill-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">informed criticism after Pointe-Noire, satisfied his critics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He returned to the 4-4-2 formation which brought the 1996</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African Nations Cup to South Africa, and among the sacrificial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lambs was long-serving captain and central defender Neil</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tovey. Doctor Khumalo was back in midfield, and what an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">inspired move that proved as the man idolised by millions of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africans emphasised that he had the skills to ensure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that Bafana Bafana visit the Eiffel Tower next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philemon Masinga was also back after one of the shortest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">retirements in international football history and his headed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">winner completed a fairytale many fair-minded supporters must</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have dreamt of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, so good. Goals from Khumalo and Masinga taking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa to joint first place with Congo, who came down to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">earth with an almighty bang by losing 3-0 to Zambia at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independence Stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serious football fans watching the Congolese Red Devils</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">literally terrorise South Africa must have realised that here</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was a good team rather than a great one. The result in Lusaka</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">confirmed this viewpoint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while it would be nice to dwell on the predatory nature</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and selfless toil of Masinga and the delicate ball skills of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khumalo (he turned a Zairean so many times before crossing for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the winner that one started feeling dizzy), it would also be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">deceptive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is hard to offer any defence for the defence, save to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">say that none of the incumbents abandoned their posts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">although, come to think of it, where was Sizwe Motaung when</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire equalised? Nowhere near the dreadlocked Zico Tumbu for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 20-year-old son of a member of the Zairean team which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">played in the 1974 World Cup in West Germany could hardly have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">believed his luck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New captain Lucas Radebe needlessly lost possession and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngoy Nsumbu pushed the ball beyond the reach of Mark Fish to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the inrushing Tumbu, who sidefooted past Andr' Arendse with an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ease which belied the fact that he was a debutant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barker later noted that a bus could have been driven</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">through the defence, and he was not referring to a 20-seat</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">minibus either. On a day when South Africa attacked with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">renewed conviction, the defence leaked like the proverbial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sieve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the coach wants to bring Tovey back for the friendly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with England at Old Trafford on May 24 when surely he should</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">work on developing Motaung, Fish, Radebe and David Nyathi into</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a less charitable unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arendse suffered severely from the defensive uncertainty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and at times it was difficult to believe that here was a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">goalkeeper who had entered April without conceding a goal in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">695 minutes of international action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barker admitted later that he died a thousand deaths, many</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of them no doubt triggered by a back four that often lacked</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">even the rudimentary skills of hoofing the ball upfield when</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">under pressure. Your own penalty area is no place for one-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">twos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be fair, it was asking a lot even of Radebe to become</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">defensive kingpin and captain on the same afternoon and he,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motaung and Nyathi had arrived in South Africa only three days</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">before the big match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How much longer can Barker be so accommodating when it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">comes to the release of players from European clubs. Clive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fears a backlash if he plays hardball, but most countries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">insist on the five-day rule being observed with no obvious</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">retaliation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durban - Young women still warm to poets, especially when</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">they are good-looking. So there are welcoming smiles for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Breyten Breytenbach when he enters a tomb-like vault</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">underneath the Sneddon Theatre at the University of Natal in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a green metal box on a shelf on the wall marked</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;40&quot;. Perhaps a man with a gun will come for it later from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coin Security. But more likely it is empty. There is also a</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">huge poster showing William Shakespeare looking enigmatic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the centre of the action is a pile on the floor of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">black electronic gadgetry with flickering lights and two</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">speakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two young women are working on a sound- track that will be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">used every night during the Poetry Africa 97 festival at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sneddon from Sunday May 4. This will be South Africa's first</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">international poetry festival. Poets are flying in from all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">over - Nigerian Niyi Osundare, Zimbabwean Chenjerai Hove,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mexican Homero Aridjis, Indian Sujata Bhatt and others. Some</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the work will be translated line by line. There will also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">be drums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the workroom under the theatre, with the women hovering</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">around, there is gentle music, then a reflective voice takes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">over sonorously from the loudspeakers. The voice has a warm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">assurance. Breytenbach gestures gently. He says he wants the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sounds to &quot;clothe&quot; the theatre as the audience comes in. It</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">doesn't matter if people cannot make out exactly what is being</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said. The poets themselves will be on stage later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The young women agree, but one of them is perturbed about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the &quot;medieval piece&quot;. It is intrusive. How would it be if they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">used for the recording just three poets reading their work,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not more? She says they could loop the tape and come back</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">again to the start. Breytenbach agrees. &quot;The lights will still</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">be on in the auditorium at the beginning,&quot; he says, &quot;people</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will be settling down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Breytenbach is a remarkable man by any standards. He</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">flowered early as one of the country's most exciting young</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">poets. He left the country and settled in Paris. At the height</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of apartheid he shocked Nationalist Afrikanerdom by taking a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vietnamese wife. In terms of apartheid, the woman was, well,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">technically, non-white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later Breytenbach became the world's most unlikely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">terrorist, landing at what was called Jan Smuts Airport</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wearing a beard and heavy spectacles. The political police</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">followed him everywhere. He was sent to jail and wrote rather</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fabulously about that after they finally let him out, and he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">went back overseas. He paints and exhibits his pictures in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">many places. His written work has been translated into many</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">languages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When somebody asked him where his home is now, he was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unsure because he travels so widely. His questioner persisted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Where is your dentist?&quot; he asked Breytenbach. Breytenbach</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">worked it out. &quot;My dentist lives in Paris,&quot; he said.&quot;Then that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is your home,&quot; said the questioner triumphantly. &quot;Paris is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">your home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Breytenbach continues to be peripatetic, but for three</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">months each year now he lives in Durban, as visiting professor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at the University of Natal, where he works at the Centre for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Creative Arts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This itself is a remarkable creation, unique in South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa. Breytenbach has been running creative-writing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">workshops there for several years now. More recently, a well-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">known former publisher and also, himself, a poet, Adriaan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donker, was appointed head of the centre. He and Breytenbach</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">came up with the idea of a poetry festival and began asking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">around. Nineteen poets have accepted invitations to attend, at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">least seven from South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only will there be readings and performances each</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">evening this coming week at the Sneddon, there will also be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">workshops, when locals will be able to sit in on discussions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">among the visitors. They will be talking about writing in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exile, for example, and poetry in translation. The meetings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will be at various venues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will not be a solemn affair. Not all poetry is sad or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">about love and death; some of it is very funny. One of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">funniest poets coming to the festival is Adrian Henri. He</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">comes from Liverpool. &quot;Just like the Beatles,&quot; says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Breytenbach. Henri is eloquent and highly entertaining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I ask Breytenbach how he manages to keep so fit. Does he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pump iron? He says no. He jogs and he does some t'ai chi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, he says, his wife looks after him very well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poetry Africa 97 runs at the Elizabeth Sneddon Theatre in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durban from May 4 to 10, from 7.30pm every evening. Tickets</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are available through Computicket at R7 per performance, or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">phone (031) 304-2753 for credit-card bookings</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In the age of art-as-illustrated-press-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">release, it is all too easy to dismiss the arduous processes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of print-making as being out of touch with current times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still relegated to the bottom rung of the art collector's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ladder, prints tend to regarded as less worthy in art currency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">terms because of their reproduceability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, in the work of Eunice Geustyn (above right) and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alma Eta Vorster (above left), there is the danger of becoming</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">too immersed in the manual virtuosity of their work at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">expense of meaning. Geustyn is the more sentimental of the two</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in her depictions of landscape as a &quot;tainted sublime&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Latching on to the 1990s eco- feminist label, she attempts to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">articulate the current state of chaos and spiritual decline in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the environment through surreal imagery set in fantastical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">landscapes. Archetypal, totemic and sexually suggestive forms</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- igloos, pyramidal rocks and crater- like ravines - abound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The forms are often placed in opposition to each other,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">setting up a dialectic between male and female, sacred and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">profane - and by implication - unsullied innocence and tainted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geustyn's pantheistic preoccupations obviously have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">something to do with those of land artists attempting to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">address issues of environmental degradation and heighten the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">spiritual consciousness of a morally disfigured society. But</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">her passionate intentions get lost in the delivery. Her</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rendition of them is too pristine, too precious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consequently, Geustyn's fictional landscapes remain less</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">indictments of a degraded landscape than pretty fantasyscapes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conversely, the painstaking, complex processes involved in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vorster's work, particularly her collographs, operate far less</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in opposition to her imagery. Her work is located in a kind of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of psycho/cyberspace where pre-history and post-history</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">collide. Through quirky titles and absurdist imagery -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">levitating road signs, screws, cogs, metronomes, bionic beasts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and desiccated bones - Vorster depicts a tragi-comic onslaught</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of information in a world engaged in bulimic rituals of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">consumption and regurgitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact Vorster's work is similar, in its deployment of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">certain imagery, to the futuristic work of Fernand Leger in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the 1930s, whose paintings warned of the dehumanising,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">alienating effects of progress. Vorster's techno-toylands seem</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to show the consequences of that unheeded warning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The works of Eunice Geustyn and Alma Eta Vorster were at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Thompson Gallery</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - IN transporting Henrik Ibsen's 19th-century</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">naturalist drama An Enemy of the People to a local context,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wits University's chairman of African languages, Professor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nhlanhla Maake's adaptation is, in his own words, &quot;a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">prostitute&quot;. But it's a hooker with no sell-by date because</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ibsen's timeless themes of power, corruption and the quest for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">truth are both universal and current.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the original 1882 play, Dr Stockman exposes impurities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the water at the town baths, and in his attempts to save</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the town, discovers that truth can be an unpopular bedfellow.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a romantic salute to individualism in an age where the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">notion of an individual standing alone on principle against</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the odds was accepted as inspirational and possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In stark contrast stands New York theatre writer Charles</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marowitz's 1982 adaptation, where the principled Dr Stockman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ends the play not in triumph, but in isolation. In modern</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">society, according to Marowitz, the lone voice &quot;which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">articulates 'the ideal' has, at best, only a poetic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">significance. The reward for committed idealism is not the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">accumulation of inner strength, but a one-way ticket to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">oblivion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Maake's adaptation, set in the town of Warmbaths,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">falls somewhere between Ibsen and Marowitz. Dr Mish discovers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">water-borne impurities and the rot in the local</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">administration, the media and industry. Maake's intention with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the adaptation is to stimulate debate on whether society</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">should be re-aligning, in terms of itself and the individual,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">within it. He is concerned with society's capacity to question</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and its ability to avoid developing a herd instinct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike Marowitz's bleak ending, Maake's hopeful, if perhaps</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a little sentimental, Dr Mish is shunned by society, but finds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">solace and support in his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the adaptation and the production took into account</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the varying degrees of talent and experience at the Wits Drama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">School, resulting in a production of varying degrees of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Solid performances by Matthews Molefe as Dr Mish and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Litheko Mascola as the mayor, were unable to humanise a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">didactic arena where debate took preference over the human</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dynamic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an adaptation seeking to comment on some of society's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">current concerns, An Enemy of the People is a lone voice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">calling for independent and critical thought in a society of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">factions, affiliations and historically driven power blocs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Power to the People is one of a series of productions</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - As I was leaving Mike Leigh's Secrets and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lies, it occurred to me that the impact of the movie pretty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">much depends on how screwed up your mother was. Or, for that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">matter, exactly how much it screwed your mother up to give</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">birth to this life that would become a shadow for the rest of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">her days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the only way I could justify finding myself moved to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tears at unexpected moments throughout the movie. It was</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">either that or the copious amounts of booze that had flowed at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the opening night cocktail do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In retrospect, most of the movie's emotional clout probably</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has to do with Brenda Blethyn's astounding performance as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cynthia, a white trash factory worker and single mother whose</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">abandoned black daughter, the optician Hortense (Marianne</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jean-Baptiste), tracks her down and resolves to become an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">active part of her destiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's not your standard adopted-kid-goes-through-crisis-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">traces-real-parents kind of thing. It's gritty and beautiful</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and funny and sad and even if you hate experimental movies,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">you really shouldn't let a Mike Leigh go by. He's Britain's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">most admired director - among many critics and a smallish,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">though reverential, fan club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His last three films - High Hopes, Life is Sweet and Naked</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- received accolades and awards. With the exception of Naked,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a brilliant, bleak and generally fucked-up tale of three</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">slackers trying to cope with the alienation of modern times,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leigh sticks to a small urban world centred around the family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What makes Secrets and Lies different, however, is that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leigh is starting to command bigger budgets, thus has more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">time to develop projects. The meticulously real and varied</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">characters and plot in Secrets and Lies attest to a bigger</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">picture and a tastier slice of life than before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As is true of the entire cast, Blethyn and Jean-Baptiste</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(both nominated for Oscars this year) are brilliant tools for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leigh's method. And also for his madness. He enters his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">projects without a storyline, let alone a script, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">improvises. &quot;Mike simply got in touch with me and said he was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">doing a film,&quot; said Jean-Baptiste in a recent interview. &quot;We</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rehearsed for six months, but only in the last stages did it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">become clear who I was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unsurprisingly, not all actors can cope with the method,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which developed from his theatre and TV work. &quot;I could never</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have star actors. Stars only do a film if they've checked the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">script before,&quot; said Leigh in an interview after he and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blethyn scooped the top awards for Secrets and Lies at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1996 Cannes film festival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The method's been down for years; it's the madness that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">really gels here. Leigh has previously been attacked by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">critics for his defensiveness when criticised; his cold view</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of humanity (particularly women) and his romanticised notions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the working class (he is, in fact, himself of a middle-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">class Jewish extract, not working class as he likes to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">suggest).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is these same aspects which inform his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">individuality: the delicious comic tension that develops</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">between his misanthropy and his philanthropy; between his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">users and abusers; and between his upper and lower classes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secrets and Lies opened on circuit on May 1. It was the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1996 Cannes Palme d'Or winner</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Guy Stubbs recalls with visceral clarity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the time he decided to take happy snaps. He'd stumbled across</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a scene that was typical of South Africa during the state of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">emergency: the smell of burning rubber, a smouldering corpse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Close by, policemen were taking notes like traffic officers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">issuing parking fines. A crowd of onlookers listlessly stood</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">around the scene of the tragedy. And the necklace victim's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">child carried on playing the kinds of games that children</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">play, even in a war zone. That was South Africa at its most</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">soulless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a photographer I should have shot that scene,&quot; he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recalls. &quot;It was award-winning material. But I couldn't do it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I couldn't capture pain any more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And looking at his work eight years later, you can't help</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">agreeing that Stubbs made the right choice. Pictures of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pantsulas giving the high five, beaming homeowners in front of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gleaming shacks and tiny, manicured lawns; the white woman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">butcher framed by carcasses, a bunch of wannabe karate kids</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">practising their kartas in the local community centre. Shot in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">intense, dramatic, breathtakingly beautiful colour. All of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">them happy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stubbs would make a great propagandist or police spy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Except for the fact that the man is too disarmingly open, too</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unashamedly positive. He clearly hasn't got an ideological</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bone in his body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stubbs is exhibiting his photographs at the Worker's Museum</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and library in Newtown - a poignant monument to South Africa's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">migrant labour system. Sponsored by the European Union, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exhibition is called Development in our Time: a Celebration</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of Progress. As the title indicates, it arises from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">documenting development projects initiated by the RDP, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mvula Trust, Get Ahead Foundation and other community</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">upliftment initiatives undertaken by NGOs such as the Kagiso</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trust and Independent Development Trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the cynical, the images might look like postcards of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">prettified poverty. To those observers who still believe in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">slogans like powering our future and building a brighter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">future, they are testimonies to the indomitable spirit of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">communities for whom waiting and wanting have been a natural</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as breathing. And they are documents of people who - short-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">changed first by apartheid, then by empty promises - have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nevertheless built modest monuments to pride and dignity from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the everyday scraps of disadvantaged lives</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I simply photograph what I see,&quot; explain Stubbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Communities that for the first time have running water;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">informal settlement dwellers who have tarred roads and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">electricity and cultivate beautiful gardens outside their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shacks ... And although they are still poor, they have a sense</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of pride and dignity, and they don't mind sharing that with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're driving through Ivory Park squatter camp, near</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tembisa, which has mushroomed into a mini metropolis. The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">older section has tarred streets and a latticework of power</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lines forms a safety net between the modest homes. Some of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lines have been pilfered from affluent white streets. Some of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the homes are brick - a sign of middle class aspirations. In</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the newest section, work is already under way to construct</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">roads and introduce electricity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is really where the RDP money is going,&quot; says Stubbs,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">punctuating his colourful anecdotes about shebeens and spazas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with equally expressive forays into onomatopoeic language,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">like &quot;brzzipp&quot; and &quot;whooosh&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stops to give some young guys a ride and bowls them over</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with his fluency in the vernacular and in tsotsitaal. And with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exaggerated hand gestures and body speak. It is easy to see</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">why he takes such friendly photographs. He simply endears</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">himself to everyone he encounters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And watching Stubbs at work, it is evident he is no danger</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">junkie in search of another adrenalin fix. He gets his rush</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from the people he encounters. His life extends way beyond the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">photo frame.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The FNB/Sama (South African Music Awards)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">may have opened well with a gracefully orchestrated medley</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">representing different South African music forms, but by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">time it was nearly over and Dr Victor led a line-up in a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sentimental anthem about not doing crime, a lot of that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">promise had fizzled out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main trouble was the MC, Treasure Tshabalala, kept</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">disappearing and leaving the ceremony hanging in the air. He</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">also failed to deal with his mistake when he started calling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">up Gauteng MEC for Safety and Security, Jesse Duarte, at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wrong time, leaving her halfway up the aisle and not a clue as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to what to do next.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the fact that it wasn't quite all right on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">night, the awards are extremely important to the industry in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">terms of publicity, excitement generated and recognition for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hard work. They're also a marvellous live showcase, in one</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">place, of all the different types of music being generated in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">our country - white rock meets traditional Tsonga meets</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">boeremusiek meets cool jazz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ceremony simply has to reach the point where it's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">slick enough for a live TV broadcast, and it's not there yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The soundtrack for the brief video projections on stage with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">each nomination were inaudible and the only presenters who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bothered to work out a routine were comics Joe Mafela and Leon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schuster. They were marvellous, adapting Hier Kom Die Alabama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to Hier Kom Bafana Bafana, and stealing the show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were two really worthwhile innovations: the lifetime</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">achievement award, given to Ladysmith Black Mambazo's Joseph</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shabalala and an outstanding contribution award, given to one-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">time pennywhistler-turned-producer West Nkosi. While both</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">these men deserved their awards and without intending to take</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">anything from them, there are, in fact, much older people</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">around who deserve them. It would be nice if they were given</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">some recognition before it's too late for anything but a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">posthumous statuette.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps FNB/Sama could look at organising some special</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">events through the year to honour some of these people. Just</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">think of the broadcast opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other interesting feature about the awards is gleaned</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from the programme's list of best-selling albums of the year,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the golds (25 000 units) and the platinums (50 000). These</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rarely intersect with award- winners. Indeed, the Grammys have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">long been criticised for giving awards to top sellers, at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">expense of originality, skill or inspiration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, in a list of 21 gold and 17 platinum sellers, only five</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">won an award - Amadodana Ase Wesile's Ndikhokhele 'O Jehova</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for best traditional gospel, M'du's Ipompe for best</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">township/kwaito dance, Skeem's Waar Was Jy? for best township</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pop, Soul Brothers' Umshado for best mbaqanga performance and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebecca's multi-platinum Uzube Nam for bestseller of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(So there is one commercial category.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were five nominations for awards in the bestsellers -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Hofmeyr's Decade for best adult contemporary Afrikaans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">performance, M'du's Ipompe for best township pop, Thomas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chauke na Shinyori Sisters' Shimatsatsa Number 16 for best</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tsonga music, Abashante's Girls for best newcomer and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebecca's Uzube Nam for best contemporary gospel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Winners like Sibongile Khumalo and Johannes Kerkorrel (best</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">male vocalist, best adult contemporary Afrikaans), haven't</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">even reached gold sales, although Kerkorrel's late release</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">last year may mean big sales this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking at the bestsellers of the year, there are four main</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">categories that hit the jackpot - gospel, Afrikaans, township</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dance and traditional. English and instrumental music don't</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">feature, although again, both Soweto String Quartet and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tananas were released very late last year and may still rack</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">up large sales.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - President Mandela arrived on a donkey cart</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and the Premier, Manne Dipico, on a camel. The president</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">insisted on this - after all this is an important animal in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upington, a town of 60 000 in the Northern Cape, near the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalahari, where the national Freedom Day celebrations were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">held last Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imagine Bill Clinton or Helmut Kohl on a donkey cart?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holding official celebrations in a town whose biggest event is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the annual expo and Roseintjiefees? Upington was excited,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that's for sure. The Danie Kuys stadium had been packed with</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">people of all ages since 7am.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only in South Africa could it happen that the small plane</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">taking us to the event carried in it: Minister of Arts and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Culture Lionel Mtshali, Minister of Health and Welfare</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geraldine Fraser-Moloketi, the Rasta Rebels, the media, Mango</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Groove, Roger Jardine (director general of the Department of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arts, Culture, Science and Technology) and director thereof,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carol Steinberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hysterical schoolkids lined the streets in their gym kits</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and uniforms; the brass band were in their white outfits and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">young drummies in blue, green and red were getting ready to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">walk into the stadium to the strains of Sarie Marais, in what</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was surely the biggest performance of their life. The Truth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Recoinciliation Commission's Piet Meiring was trying to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">preach but had to compete with the excitement of the crowds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">who were obviously more interested in the parachutists</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">trailing red smoke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sure, there were the standard state celebration routines -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">like the marching army men and the 21-gun salute, the South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African Airforce flypast and, of course, the singing of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">national anthem ... But there was none of the cold formality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">one would have expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We could sense Mandela had arrived by the buzz in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">crowd. The marshals were desperately trying to get people to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sit when children started sprinting towards his car. &quot;ANC!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC!,&quot; chanted the crowds; then came the wave of toyi-toyi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">chants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike in apartheid-era state celebrations, the headlined</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">minister was not of defence or something like that, but of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">arts and culture. The idea of rotating the official</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">celebration from province to province (instead of keeping it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">entrenched in Pretoria) is to showcase each province's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">culture. It was the Department of Arts and Culture that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">organised the event nationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upington was surely the right place to do this. There were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Upington 14 freedom fighters who narrowly escaped the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">death penalty in the 1980s and received copies of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">constitution from the president at the celebrations. And talk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">about cultural diversity: in this province people speak</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afrikaans, Xhosa, SeTswana and Nama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I felt like crying when Mandela insisted on shaking the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hands of the schoolchildren who gave him messages from the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">heads of all the provinces. A 14-year-old girl in a wheelchair</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">had not been wheeled towards him, so when she was wheeled</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">away, Mandela said: &quot;stop, I want to greet that child.&quot; He</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">came down from the podium to speak to her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the day was genuinely moving, especially the Nama</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">praise-singer using a language that is not documented and in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">danger of dying. Mandela made the state of the nation address</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the province's lingua franca: Afrikaans. The small-town</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">courtesy was refreshing after the plastic PR people of the big</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a lunch for VIPs Mandela signed a local artist's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">painting and walked around among the people. There was a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">performance by the !Xu and Khwe San Bushman group, made up of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">children from the Schmidtsdrift Camp for a landless people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the stage, especially erected and fitted with great</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sound equipment, were performers as diverse as the Black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dickies, pantsula dancers from Kimberley, blonde gospel-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">singer Cornel Kuhn and the Savmelana cultural group children</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from Upington. Then there was the boeremusiek of Pieter van</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">der Wetshuizen. Some were good, some bad, but that wasn't the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">point. The crowd gave them so much love. But it was Dr Victor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Mango Groove that drove the crowd into a frenzy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the sun went down the kids, police and officials danced,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">kids made sand castles in the longjump pit and raced along the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">athletics track. One child walked by with a balloon made of a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">condom from the health department stall. It was tied together</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with red and white plastic police barricade tape.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - 'Fashion is not just an industry,&quot; says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British designer Katharine Hamnett. &quot;It exists as a cultural</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">phenomenon; it reflects the underlying thing - what Jung calls</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the collective unconscious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you take the premise that Hamnett is correct then the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saleshouse Vukani! Fashion Awards - &quot;the ultimate in fashion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">design, showcasing the country's most creative talented</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">designers&quot; - held at the carlton Centre on Saturday night,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gave a clear message for the country's collective unconscious:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">get thee all to a shrink.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The invitation clearly stated the starting times as 6pm, on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the dot. Guest speaker, premier Tokyo Sexwale arrived at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.45pm, with a cohort of black guys in suits, curiously</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reminiscent of Reservoir Dogs, and followed by his diminutive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With him came the arts and culture tribe: Themba Wakashe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Firdoze Bulbulia. Queen Mantfombi Zulu was present, with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unctuous attendance being danced by Sonwabile Ndamase,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">president of the South African Fashion Designers Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But where was the piece de resistance, designer Marianne</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fassler? &quot;She absconded, per se,&quot; says Ndamase. Fassler had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">told Ndamase by fax and phone that she could not attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A quick glance at the judges - which included Contralesa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">leader Chief Phatikile Holomisa and Sabrina Walker of Sales</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">house - confirmed my worst fears: not one person who could</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tell the difference between Fortuny and Lagerfeld, darling. No</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">editors, no stylists, no photographers - and no designers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want a South African aesthetic to emerge from this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">country,&quot; Wakashe told the predominantly black audience. &quot;The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">members of the last government wore top hats and tails,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">claimed Sexwale with rampant inaccuracy (cheers). &quot;Nelson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela has broken the stiff ice of the suit,&quot; (more cheers)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he continued. &quot;give support to the small designers not yet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">captured in Paris and Rome,&quot; (near hysteria). Was this an ANC</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">event or what? Of course, all this was forgivable if the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;designers&quot; were good. They weren't. Gone was the bump and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">grind, the tension that should go into a ramp show. In came</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the tame creations of dressmakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be hard to make model Glen Fisher look absurd, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">they succeeded time and time again, in garments ranging from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tyrolean cocktail to Mala Mala on acid. One model couldn't get</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on to the ramp because her shoulder pads were too big; another</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tottered along pulling down a frock so short &quot;pussy pelmet&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would not be a misnomer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the finalists trotted out European fantasies, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">kind of kitsch that does so well in Sandton: crinoline skirts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and bodices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think this event should be more transparent and at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">grass roots level,&quot; a splendidly dressed Zulu matron told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aaron Sepeng, a second year fashion student from Pretoria</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Technikon was the only one to make an original comment and to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">show real talent. Not that he won.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prizes went to the creators of the most conventional</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">statements because those were the ones the judges could</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">understand: first prize to Elaine Buckwater, second to Irene</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viera and third to Esther Nyatho-Mudao. Pity that poor Ms</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buckwater was called up for a prize and then was told they'd</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">made a mistake. Great relief when she won first prize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And where, oh where, did she get that lovely Dralon frock?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - BABALWA NANI (21) has spent the past five</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">years on the streets of Cape Town doing anything and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">everything to survive. Now she is involved in an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">autobiographical radio documentary. She has shifted from being</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a homeless petty criminal to radio producer - part of a new</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">project by a local non-profit organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first night I was on the street I thought, where am I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">going to sleep,&quot; she says. &quot;But that wasn't a problem, friends</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">told me. There's a railway bridge, they said, and in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">middle there's a river flowing. So water wasn't a problem at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">all ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For a living we committed crime. We left Rondebosch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">because the police bothered us. One of us suggested we sleep</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at the graveyard. We decided to break open the top of a grave</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that looked like a house-shape from the outside. Inside it was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">empty,&quot; says Nani in a recording of her autobiography, Think</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The radio project, she says, can rescue her from a past she</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would rather forget: &quot;I want to do something right that I can</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">feel good and proud about myself ... that I've achieved</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">something through hard work,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The training is conducted by Otherwise, a voluntary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">organisation aimed at developing audio and literacy skills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The young recruits are taught script writing, studio and field</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recording and editing. Concentrating mostly on disadvantaged</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">people, Otherwise doesn't delve too deeply into the suffering</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of their recruits, preferring to pass on skills rather than be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">counsellors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the radio documentaries touch on issues such as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">substance abuse, the girls are left to discuss their lives in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a way that's comfortable for them, says Otherwise co-ordinator</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and trainer Kali van der Merwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She adds that it is hard for the girls to &quot;talk about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">things like prostitution and rape. It's very painful for them,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">so we concentrate rather on coming out of it - for this reason</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the pupils named themselves The Breakthrough Girls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Merwe says Nani, who never worked as a prostitute,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has made some &quot;remarkable recoveries&quot; through her involvement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the radio project and adds proudly: &quot;She decided to change</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">her life. She no longer drinks heavily, she no longer commits</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">petty crime for survival, she is finishing her schooling. She</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is learning to be responsible, plan her time effectively and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to budget and handle money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that is not where it ends as the trainees often feel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">there are additional benefits such as self-motivation and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">offering the possibility of a way out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nani is now studying with the hope of completing standard</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">eight and devotes weekends to working on her radio programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The radio programmes completed by Otherwise are funded by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Open Society Foundation, and this enables the girls to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">earn a fee for their work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Otherwise plans to set up a permanent skills training</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">centre, perhaps even a small radio station which could</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">increase the number of people who are reached, says Van der</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Otherwise has completed three programmes so far:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Nonhlupheko, a drama about leaving an abusive home and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">going on to the streets of Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Breakthrough Girls, a documentary about the five</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">girls at Ons Plek and the futures they see for themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Street Educators, a documentary in which youths on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the street are interviewed about their concerns, needs and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">aspirations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programmes have been aired on a range of community</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stations. &quot;But if we are going to survive, we're going to have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to sell programmes to big independents or the SABC. Community</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">radio just doesn't have the budget to buy,&quot; says Van der</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programmes are not all about the streets. Charmain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carrol (19), for example, has been working on preserving her</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">heritage through Grandmother Stories recorded in Xhosa in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eastern Cape and to be broadcast on Radio Zibonele and Radio</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Xhosa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carrol set out to record folk tales passed on from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">generation to generation: &quot;These stories are about the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">peoples' beliefs and they tell it to the younger generation so</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that the stories must not be forgotten as this is the Xhosa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My grandmother used to tell me these stories and it always</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ended up with people telling jokes in bed in the dark,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">laughing. I look forward to telling them to my grandchildren.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carrol, who also lives at Ons Plek and has a baby, is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">studying for matric. Originally from Phillipi squatter camp</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">near Nyanga she was placed at Ons Plek when she was 17 and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">pregnant. However, thanks to the radio programme, Carrol too</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has found some hope. &quot;This radio project has changed my life,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">she says. &quot;I didn't know what to do, what to be. Now I know I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">want to work in radio and to one day have my own radio</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">programme.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In the final part of our guide to Web sites</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Africa, we look at the people who make it happen: the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Internet service providers (ISPs).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa has been a long time arriving on the Internet. South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa and Tunisia were the first countries on this continent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">where ordinary members of the public could get full access to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Internet, back in 1993. They were followed by another 10</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">countries during the next two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya arrived in November 1995 with one 9,6kbps connection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today it boasts many 64kbps connections, and sums up the speed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at which Internet connectivity accelerates in Africa once it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">arrives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the main reason why listings of African ISPs are at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">best out of date, and at worst a woefully inadequate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reflection of the evolution of communications on the</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Local representatives of South Africa's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">leading trade partners regularly suffer from crime, a snap</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">survey by the Mail &amp; Guardian shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff members of foreign embassies and chambers of commerce</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are often at the forefront of deals running into billions of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rands of imports and exports. (Some indication of these are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">contained in trade figures from the Department of Customs and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Excise for the first nine months of 1996.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These diplomats and trade attaches are the very people who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have to sell South Africa as a viable trading partner and a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">land ripe for investment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But many of them, and still more of their employees, have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fallen victim to the crime wave. Some say this will have an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">impact on trade and investment; but others are not as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JAPAN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imports: R8,7-billion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exports: R6,3-billion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three members of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce have had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their cars hijacked. According to a chamber representative,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Japanese embassy has increased awareness among Japanese</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nationals about crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police need to be strengthened and become less corrupt,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The director of the Japanese External Trade Organisation in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg, Shintaro Matoba, had his car stolen in Sandton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City. He believes that the reasons for the current crime are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the high unemployment rate and the poor quality of policemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investments from Japan are &quot;half-and-half&quot; affected by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">crime level, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AUSTRALIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imports: R2,6-billion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exports: R1,5-billion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noel O'Brien, a director of the Australian South African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business Association, has had a personal experience of local</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">crime. Four months ago, two robbers held a knife to his chest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the garage of his office building in central Johannesburg</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and grabbed his portable computer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the past six months, three other employees have been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mugged, one was hijacked and the bakkie of the association's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">driver has been stolen twice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year the association moved its offices to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">suburb of Parktown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Brien says that he has lived in South Africa for 22</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">years, but crime has grown worse in the past three years. &quot;The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">police can't cope with it anymore. It's a war zone out there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's why I think troops should be patrolling the suburbs at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">night, or at least there should be roadblocks or control</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">points on the streets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Brien says Australians are not keen to invest in South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa: &quot;The security situation, the labour unrest, low</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">productivity and the high level of taxation in South Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are the main concerns from Australian investors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why should they look at South Africa as a good investment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">area? They would rather go to Asia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GERMANY:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imports: R16,2-billion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exports: R4,5-billion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A German study last month found that one in five local</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">managers had one or more murders reported among staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey by the German Chamber of Commerce in South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa, representing 82 companies with more than 35 000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">employees, found that, on average, every 18 months the family</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of a managing director of a German company in South Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">becomes a victim of crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than three-quarters of the German companies say that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their future growth is endangered by the high crime level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the managers surveyed said: &quot;We see the present</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">state of anarchy, lawlessness and escalating violent crime as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a major threat to the survival of our business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another manager warned: &quot;The whole economy is being damaged</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by the virtual non- existence of a criminal justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crime is eroding consumer confidence, forcing many people to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">leave the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only 15% of German companies claimed they would not change</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their future plans because of crime. This group employs 47% of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the total workforce - and this indicates that smaller</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">companies are more likely to change their investment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">strategies owing to crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNITED KINGDOM</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imports: R12,3-billion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exports: R12,3-billion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The experiences of British diplomats include the hijacking</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British High Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Britain - South Africa's largest trading partner - is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not discouraged by the high crime rate. The press</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">representative at the High Commission, Andrew Noble, says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">crime is not &quot;a significant factor&quot; in Britain deciding about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investment in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What matters are the business prospects and British</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investors feel that they are very good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The High Commission is encouraging trade, investment and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the establishment of more businesses in South Africa, says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noble. &quot;We are very committed to this place.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pretoria, says that staff as well as consular representatives</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in both Pretoria and Johannesburg have suffered several thefts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and attempted hijackings. Alarm systems at the embassy and at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the homes of staff have been improved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes that criminals should be sentenced more</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a year ago, as a result of a dispute with</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although no research has been done, they believe that Dutch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">companies are discouraged by the &quot;poor South-African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investment climate&quot;, of which crime is one factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, at least one highly placed diplomat - who did not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">want his nationality to be identified - says that anxiety</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">about crime is just a storm in a teacup. &quot;There are too many</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">diplomats with too little to do, leaving them with too much</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jenny Cargill of the consultancy BusinessMap says investors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">display many shades of opinion concerning the impact of crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's certainly a factor in the decision to invest foreign</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">funds, but ii is only part of a good investment backdrop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign investors are also looking for sound macro-economic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">policies, incentives and a strong regional market. However,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;consistent reports of reduced crime&quot; will only mean greater</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In the fifth part of our series on economic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">policy, Asghar Adelzadeh and Mathane Lethale of the National</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Institute for Economic Policy consider whether government</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">policies have positioned the economy towards job creation,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">poverty reduction and sustainable growth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Growth, Employment and Redistribution strategy's (Gear)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">success is not going to be based on whether the government</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">meets the deficit target, or whether exchange control is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">removed or on whether tariff barriers come down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead for most people, it's about whether these and other</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">policies are going to lead to reductions in the unemployment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rate, poverty reduction and sustainable economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government's expenditure and revenue policies are among</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">policy instruments that can potentially play a significant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">role in achieving the ultimate goals of the Reconstruction and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Development Programme (RDP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this year's Budget centres around adhering to Gear's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">specified fiscal policy regime - reduction of the size of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Budget deficit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three questions must be raised with this year's Budget:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Will lower fiscal deficit lead to the ultimate targets of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the RDP?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* How is the deficit reduction achieved in the 1997/98</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Budget?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* What are some of the implications of this year's Budget?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first question has been addressed in detail in previous</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">articles of this series. The rest of this article therefore</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">focuses on the last two questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From the 1997/98 Budget we are able to make the following</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">observations as they relate to how the deficit reduction is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">achieved in this year's Budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the national level:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* When one compares this year's revenue to the last, total</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">revenue as percentage of GDP is left unchanged with no</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">significant changes in the composition of revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In real terms, total government expenditure is expected</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to decline by 3,48%, from R176,070-billion in 1996/97 to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">R169,940-billion in 1997/98.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Real deficit reduction of 25,8% (from R30,262 to R22,541-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">billion) will mainly be achieved through expenditure cuts. In</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fact, more than 85% of deficit reduction is owing to the cuts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in expenditure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Cuts in the overall expenditure are mainly secured</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">through significant reductions in capital expenditures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current expenditure is reduced by R884- million (a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reduction of 0,62%), while total capital expenditure is cut by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">R5,62-billion (a reduction of 33,62% relative to last year's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Budget). The share of current expenditure in total expenditure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is to increase from 89,5% in 1996/97 to 92,8% in 1997/98.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The share of capital expenditure, on the other hand, is to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">decrease from 10,5% of total expenditure in 1996/97 to 7,2% in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1997/98. (See note.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In terms of the budgets of government departments, seven</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">out of the nine main departments have received real cuts in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their budgets. The exceptions are the budgets for housing and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">welfare where their allocations have increased by 133% and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12%, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the cuts in departmental budgets are severe. For</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">example, budgets for health, land affairs, water affairs,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">agriculture, transport and education are cuts in real terms by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">54,2, 17,8, 17,1, 15,2, 9,3, and 7,9 percentage points</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">respectively. Most other departmental budgets have also been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">trimmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the provincial level, examination of the White Books,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">presented by each of the provinces on their planned</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">expenditure for the financial year, shows that most will have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to tighten their belts too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Total financial allocations to nine of the provinces,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">where data were available, has been cut by 3% in real terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the provinces, the Eastern Cape's budget has received</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the highest cut of 9,9% relative to last year's budget, while</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Northern Province budget was cut the least by 1,6%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Budget cuts of the other provinces fall within this range.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng and the Northern Cape are the only two provinces</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">whose budgets have increased by 4,2% and 1,4% respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Looking at the budget allocations for five of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">provinces, where we have data on their current and capital</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">expenditures for this year and last year, together their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">budget for capital expenditures has been cut by 14,1% while</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their overall current expenditure cut amounts to 1,93%</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">relative to the 1996/97 allocations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of KwaZulu-Natal, while the budget for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">current expenditure has increased by 2,55% relative to last</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">year, the overall budget has been cut by 1,58%. This is owing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to more than one-third cut in the capital expenditure budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation in Gauteng is different in a sense that the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">increase in the overall budget for the province of 4,2% is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mainly going to a corresponding increase in current</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">expenditure of 5,17%. The figure for the current expenditure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">growth is higher because the budget for the capital</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">expenditures in the province is reduced by 6,5%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Interesting observations can also be seen in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">composition of budgets for education, transportation, welfare,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">health, public works, agriculture, and local government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overall budgets of the nine provinces for education,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">transportation, public works and local governments have been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cut, while allocations for welfare, health and agriculture</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have increased. However, all nine provinces have cut capital</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">expenditures in all the above areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of education, the allocations for seven provinces</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have been reduced, save for the North-West and Gauteng.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Budgets for transportation of all provinces are cut in real</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">terms, except in the North-West and Western Cape. The health</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">budgets of six out of the nine provinces are cut. In the case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the welfare budget, the budgets of half of the eight</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">provinces have been reduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Budget allocations for public works are cut for all the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nine provinces in real terms. Except for a small rise in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Northern Province's budget for local government and housing,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the corresponding budgets for the other eight provinces is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">also cut significantly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What are some of the implications of this year's Budget?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Elsewhere in this series concern was raised that the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">adoption by Gear of a fixed deficit/GDP target as its primary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fiscal policy instrument is likely to result in the trimming</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of public investments than their expansion to a desirable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year's Budget validates this argument where there has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been less than 1% cut in the overall current expenditure,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">while government's capital expenditures has been cut</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">significantly in real terms in order to adhere to Gear's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">deficit/GDP ratio for this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Budget is an indication, Gear's fiscal strategy that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seeks to combine the achievement of a fixed deficit/GDP target</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ratio with an expansion of public investment levels is prone</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to disappointment, unless public investment levels are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">protected by an institutional mechanism that allows them to be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">planned in conformity with macro-economic needs instead of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">short-term budgetary limits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Given the relatively larger output and employment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">multipliers associated with government capital expenditure,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the direct and indirect effects of this year's cuts in such</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">expenditures will be a reduction in government contribution to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">economic growth and employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year's cuts in the main government departments'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">budgets also raises concern as to whether fostering</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">redistribution through social and infrastructural investment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is feasible under the current budgetary constraints and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This should be of major concern in the South African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">context where achievement of sustainable economic growth is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not possible without significant improvement in income</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">distribution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Given that an objective of government policy is to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">attract higher private investment, a significant cut in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government's investment expenditure goes against all cross</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">country evidence that higher public social and infrastructural</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investment it leads to higher private investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, since there is no sign of reduction in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">interest rate (and there has been more talk of an increase in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the rate), it is unclear how the current fiscal policy is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">expected to attract private investment, even within the Gear</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">framework.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Elsewhere in this series it has been argued that South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa is not over-taxed and that a fiscal policy to promote</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">both redistribution and growth needs to increase the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">progressivity of the tax structure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far very little has been done in this direction with a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">result that planned total government revenue relative to GDP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">remains unchanged, leaving the burden of deficit- reduction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">policy on expenditure cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government's role is to create access to social</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investment for those people inadequately served in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The private sector cannot be expected to provide the necessary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">public goods essential for shared growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Free markets consistently fail to provide adequate levels</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of education, health care, housing, and physical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">infrastructure, causing unemployment and poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These results are derived from a data set where complete</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">allocations of funds between current and capital expenditures</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">were available</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;well-versed in finance, work organisation and conflict</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">resolution&quot;, says Bobby Maree, programme co-ordinator of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Development Institute for Training, Support and Education for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour (Ditsela).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Years of negotiations have made them wily deal-makers who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">can think on their feet and who know the cut-and-thrust of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">business. &quot;They're also skilled in creatively developing</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">strategy,&quot; says Maree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These qualities have meant that trade unions have become</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">key recruitment centres for three layers of government in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">past three years: national, provincial and local.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But unions are also happy hunting ground for business, who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not only employ skilled staffers, but also secure smoother</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">negotiations with employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it is national figures like Safety and Security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Sydney Mufamadi and former National Union of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mineworkers deputy general secretary Marcel Golding who are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">often counted as key losses to the union movement, it's the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gaps left at provincial and local branches which have been the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">widest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the brain drain has been stemmed, while human resource</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">practitioners point to many talents they're finding on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shop floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no leadership vacuum; the calibre of shop</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stewards is very good,&quot; says labour consultant Andrew Levy. He</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">says that Cosatu has worked fast to seal the cracks more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">successfully than the National Council of Trade Unions which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has also lost officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The older unions like those in the mining, engineering and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">chemical sectors have managed to train new officials quickly;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">but the weaker unions like those in the construction and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">security industries are struggling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosatu representative Nowetu Mpati says the federation has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">invested R1-million in a training programme stretching from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shop stewards to general secretary Sam Shilowa. &quot;Remember that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">those people who left Cosatu were not born leaders. It's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">through Cosatu training that they could be released with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">confidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To keep more of their staff, the federation has decided</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that those elected to local government can wear their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">councillor, or even mayoral, caps while remaining in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">service of trade unions. Cosatu's campaign co-ordinator, for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">example, is also the mayor of one of Johannesburg's councils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trade unions have also watched their turf alter radically</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the past three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Militant anti-government campaigns have given way to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tripartite negotiations with business and government. Wage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">negotiations demand new skills as access to company</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">information often makes the old system of demands and offers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">obsolete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ditsela director Chris Bonner says the institute is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">currently planning a new approach to company information which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">goes beyond teaching unionists how to read balance sheets, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">teaches them to use company information to win gains for their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New legislation throws up new challenges: Ditsela is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">currently running courses on the new Labour Relations Act, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">its main task is to create a career path for unionists to keep</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">them in the labour movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karl von Holdt is the co-ordinator of Cosatu's September</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commission which is planning policy to take the federation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">into the next century. The commission has identified the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">management of trade unions as an area of great need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trade unions must pay better, offer greater benefits and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">create the atmosphere in which people will flourish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while Von Holdt also points to the many new bright</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">young things in Cosatu's trade unions, he says &quot;it's difficult</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to rebuild the experience and skills built up over a number of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">years&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Laurent Kabila's Zairean Rebel Alliance for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic Forces has terminated De Beers's contract to buy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the output of the country's diamond parastatal Miba (Societe'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miniere de Bakwanga).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This blow to De Beers's control over central African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">diamond production follows two weeks of talks between the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rebels and senior De Beers executives. De Beers's London</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">office acknowledged this week that the contract had been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rescinded, though its Johannesburg headquarters declined to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebels - who now control Zaire's diamond-producing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">regions - had previously warned they wanted to end De Beers's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">monopoly in Zaire and with it cut President Mobuto Sese Seko's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">last source of revenue. His income has been derived mainly</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from diamonds over the past few years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alliance late last week put De Beers on three months'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">notice for the Miba contract, citing its ties to Mobuto and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">corrupt business practices - a charge denied by Andrew Lamont,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">representative for De Beers in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Beers is also hedging its bets in Zaire. For the present</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobuto is still president, and De Beers is still contracted to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">his government. &quot;The situation in Zaire is still fluid ... (De</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beers will) ride with the change,&quot; Lamont said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Beers is still talking to Mawampanga Mwana Nanga,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila's designated finance minister, on sales from Miba when</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the contract ends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The corporation's drubbing in Zaire is the latest in a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">series of blows to its control over the gem industry, which it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exercises through its Central Selling Organisation (CSO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CSO has contracts to buy the bulk of world diamond</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">production, and artificially buoys prices by controlling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But of the top seven diamond producers in the world - who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">account for 80% of the world's rough diamond supply by value,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">according to De Beers's latest annual report - four are now no</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">longer securely in the organisation's net.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia's Argyle diamond mine, the world's largest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">diamond producer by volume, quit the CSO last July, claiming</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it could secure better prices on the open market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russia, long a thorn in De Beers's side, leaking high-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">quality diamonds worth $1- billion a year onto the market, has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">also still to renew its sales agreement with the CSO, 14</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">months after signing a memorandum of understanding with De</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beers that it would.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire punches another hole in De Beers's control over low</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">quality gems. Its neighbour Angola - a top-quality gem</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">producer - has already reduced its dependence on the CSO,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seeking other buyers alongside De Beers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such moves could prompt a radical reshape of central</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African diamond supplies, with De Beers, uncharacteristically,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">having to follow rather than lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three other main producers are South Africa, Namibia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Botswana - where De Beers maintains close control over all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The output from Miba is industrial and near-gem diamonds -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6,5-million carats last year valued at $80-million. De Beers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is also a shareholder in Miba, through its stake in Sibeka, a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belgian company which owns 20% of Miba .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Miba's output is only a fraction of Zaire's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">estimated diamond production of $350-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is difficult to calculate Zaire's diamond wealth: much</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the production is sold locally to the licensed buying</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">offices or smuggled out to Antwerp. An unknown proportion of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this consists of smuggled Angolan diamonds, much of which come</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from the Unita opposition party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Beers closed its four buying offices in Zaire -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kinshasa, Kisagani, Mbuji-Mayi and Kahema - as the rebels</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">advanced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation then refused Alliance requests that it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reopen the offices - a move which left the field open to Jean</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boulle's America Diamond buyers, currently the only licensed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">diamond buying office in Kisangani, which is buying gems worth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">about $100 000 a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Beers's manipulation of low-quality diamond prices via</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">several harsh price cuts has enabled it to combat Argyle's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">defiance, and may go some way to cushioning it against Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angola is a different story, however. Its mainly gem-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">quality diamonds were valued at around $1-billion last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CSO was forced to buy $800-million of these gems on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">open market to underpin the prices it was targeting through</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">its normal cartel operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Beers chair Julian Ogilvie Thompson said in the latest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">annual report that De Beers had been hit by the &quot;increasing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">uncontrolled outflow of Angolan diamonds to the major cutting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">centres ... Angolan diamonds tend to be in the categories that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are in demand.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The bullet slammed into the lioness and she</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">spun in the air, falling against the electric fence behind</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which she was confined. Standing on the other side of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fence were her three young cubs - she had been separated from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">them an hour earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another shot was fired by the overseas hunter. She slumped</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to the ground in a crumpled heap. Both times, the hunter shot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from a vehicle. He then posed with the dead lioness and pulled</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at her mouth to show her teeth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, in the skinning shed, as the lioness's coat was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">removed from her body to become a &quot;trophy&quot; for the hunter,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">milk from her teats mingled with her blood on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have documentary evidence of the horror and brutality of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this hunt. On May 6, 10- million television viewers in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Kingdom will see it too, when it is exposed by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investigative programme The Cook Report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cook Report is a hard-hitting documentary series that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">goes for the jugular of issues. Among the allegations it has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investigated is that hunting operators have lured lions out of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Kruger National Park to be shot by high-paying clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme dealing with hunting on May 6 is the first of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a seven-part series. The seventh programme will deal in part</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with what has transpired since the lion breeding and hunting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">industry was first exposed. It is my hope that the last</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">programme will report an end to this sordid industry in South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings of The Cook Report investigation were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">presented for comment this week to representatives of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African government in London. In documentary and video</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">form, its findings will also be presented to the Minister of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Affairs and Tourism, Pallo Jordan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apartheid is dead, but now South Africa urgently needs to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">evolve its inhumane outlook and policies towards wild animals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International criticism could soon mount against a country</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which has freed its people, but whose wildlife is still left</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at the mercy of a utilitarian philosophy of &quot;if it pays, it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stays&quot;. The colonial conservation culture from which the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">concepts of &quot;homeland&quot; reserves and &quot;game&quot; reserves evolved is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">still too entrenched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For several months, as a consultant for the International</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fund for Animal Welfare, I have been looking behind the veil</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the lion breeding and hunting industry in Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What I have seen has left me shocked and enraged. The lethal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">use of wildlife in South Africa is a bloodthirsty, money-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hungry blot on the national landscape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today in South Africa, an industry exists in which lions in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">captive conditions are bred for the hunter's gun. The demand</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to shoot lions is enormous, as is the economic return for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">providing the client with a lion to shoot. More than 300 lions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">appear to be caught up in this sordid industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have testimony from witnesses of lions having been bought</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from a zoo, transported to a Lowveld game farm and then</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;hunted&quot; in confined areas by high-paying clients; of an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">elderly German hunter, who was unable to hunt on foot, being</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">driven into an enclosure and shooting his &quot;trophy&quot; from the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">vehicle; of lions being hunted in confined areas with bows and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">crossbows; of lions being tranquillised, then removed from the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;breeding camps&quot; and taken to where clients are able to shoot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is an account of a lioness being shot by a client's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">son (the boy was cajoled into shooting her) and taking 16</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shots to kill her; of a client shooting a male lion 12 times</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">before it died, with not one bullet aimed at the head,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">presumably so that he did not damage his future trophy; of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exotic, non-indigenous species, such as black panthers, being</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">offered for hunting at incredible prices in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Namibia, I was told it is a well-known fact that &quot;trophy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hunters&quot; often pay large sums of money to shoot a trapped</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cheetah or leopard. I was also told that if a hunter wants a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">leopard really badly, he will pay up to R7 000 to shoot it in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a cage, because hunting cheetah and leopard in the wilds in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Namibia is regarded as difficult. A reliable source said &quot;big-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shot hunters don't have the expertise for it, and most are not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fit enough anyway to follow these cats. So they pay the farmer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to let them shoot one in a cage&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Returning to lions and South Africa, it seems that if this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lion breeding and hunting business is not outlawed, white lion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hunts could also be on offer. Lion breeders are simply waiting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to build up enough &quot;stock&quot;. The commercial price for a white</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lion is rumoured to be in the region of R300 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some operations have two very separate faces: tourism on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">one side, the &quot;canned&quot; lion industry on the other. The tourism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">face is of lodges, game drives, bush walks, and fine cuisine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and accommodation. &quot;Orphan&quot; cubs might be seen gambolling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">around the grounds of the lodge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, unseen to the local and international tourists, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">same place may be breeding lions to be shot by high-paying</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tourism operation might even advertise its lion-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">breeding project as being of service to conservation - in that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the lions could replace those of wild populations should they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">become affected by disease. But they won't tell you the real</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reason why the lions are being bred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One breeder I spoke to, however, did not try to justify his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">breeding of lions with pro-conservation arguments. He simply</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">told me he was in the business to make money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He explained that over the past few years, there has been a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tremendous growth in the demand for lions and he is simply</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">capitalising on that demand. He was clearly emotionally</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">detached from the lions and saw them as commodities from which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to profit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are legal &quot;canned&quot; hunts and illegal ones. The fact</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that some are legal does not make them right; it's just that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the law sanctions such practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laws are in place that allow one to release a lion in, say,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a 1 000ha fenced area to be hunted. The absurdity of this is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that, because the area is fenced, the lion can not escape. To</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">me, such laws are window- dressing for &quot;fair chase&quot; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">legitimise a purely money-making exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the money is big. Generally, to kill a lion, one must</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">first pay for a full 10-day to 14-day hunt, costing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">approximately $5 000 to $10 000. To hunt and shoot the lion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">costs an additional $7 500 to $10 000. These amounts do not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">include the cost of the client getting to and from the game</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">farm, the costs of shooting other species, taxidermy, packing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and shipping of trophies, the daily tariff of people</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">accompanying the client.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A hunt for a lion alone is generally not offered as the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hunting operator does not gain from the accommodation and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">other fees. But one-off hunts do sometimes occur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am aware of one where the client paid R8 000 to R10 000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to shoot a lioness. On another one-off hunt, the operator</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">charged $9 000 as a deposit to shoot a male lion, with a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">further $9 000 payable when the hunt was completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African Tourism Board (Satour) could easily be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seen to be promoting this industry where lions are bred to be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shot. It lists such operators, along with others, in its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hunting Directory: South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bearing in mind the horror of the &quot;canned lion&quot; industry,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">imagine my surprise when I saw in the foreword of this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">directory: &quot;Satour supports practices that enhance the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">conservation of our country's wildlife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a Satour advertisement entitled, &quot;Go for the ultimate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">trophy and score in South Africa&quot;, it is stated: &quot;Where the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big Five ... roam free over magnificent, unspoilt bushland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is hardly a description of the situation where a lion is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bred to be hunted, and is held captive in a fenced area while</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">waiting to be shot, with no chance of escape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advertisement ends: &quot;It is always in season in South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa, where the world's finest hunting is in the bag.&quot; Well,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the proverbial cat is now out of the bag, and lobbying will</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">intensify until the lion breeding and hunting industry is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">outlawed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe this industry could potentially threaten our</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">country's tourism potential. What if an international tourism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">boycott became a reality in reaction to The Cook Report?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nature conservation authorities and the professional</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hunting associations are aware of this kind of lion hunting,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as are those in the ecotourism industry, and Satour lists the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">very places involved. Yet, despite the threat this industry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">poses to tourism, it seems there has been little opposition to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it from these quarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have been told that the video of the hunt I described at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the beginning of this article was shown months ago to Pallo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordan. Yet the killing continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People seem to have forgotten that trophy hunting is not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">part of African environmental culture. Hunting almost purely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for sport is part of the culture of Western secularism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African environmentalism has been eroded by recent human</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">history, politics and the entrenched colonial conservation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">outlook prevalent in South Africa today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa is being raped by outsiders demanding ivory and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rhino horn, and by the exotic pet trade, the wild bird trade,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the trade in seal penises and other wildlife products. These</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">demands are not coming from Africa, but from the Middle and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Far East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africans and non-Africans who respect authentic African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">environmentalism must now rally together for the sake of our</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wild animals. Why, as Africans, are we allowing such hideous</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">crimes to be inflicted upon lions and a myriad other species</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as a result of the foreign culture of trophy hunting, and the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">foreign demand for the body parts of our wild animals?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - You can see it in the sadness of her eyes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leah Shibambo would love to believe this strange American's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">promises of how his new game reserve filled with wild animals,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">marinas, lodges, luxury resorts and tourists aboard a steam</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">train will bring peace and prosperity to her village in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">southern Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in one lifetime she has experienced an almost complete</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cycle of oppression: forced labour as a child on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Portuguese plantations; the grinding poverty of failed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">socialism under Frelimo; and then one of the most brutal civil</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wars waged anywhere in the world this century. It is easy to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">understand why her face is a portrait of blighted hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have come to Zitundo, a tiny settlement where 160 people</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">live by gathering wild fruits and fishing in the beautiful</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lake nearby, to hear what the villagers think about an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">extraordinary decision of the Mozambican government to grant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American billionaire James Blanchard exclusive rights to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">convert 236 000ha of southern Maputo province - a stunningly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">beautiful piece of land the size of Israel - into a multi-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">million-dollar mecca of tourism.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now,&quot; says Shibabmo, &quot;it is the time of peace. But it is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">just peace by word and not by practice. We have no jobs and no</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">food. Even in the colonial times it was better because then we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">could buy some cloth and rice. This new government does not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">understand the situation of poor people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a refrain that is often heard in parts of Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">these days. Colonialism was bad, but it was better than life</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">under a government incapable of fulfilling the promise of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">economic development after independence. And into the void</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">steps people like James Ulysses Blanchard III.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1980s, the flamboyant free-marketeer helped bankroll</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">an insurgency led by right- wing Renamo rebels against the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">left-wing Frelimo government. Blanchard stipulated his money</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was for education, propaganda and medical aid but there is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">little doubt it helped the rebel army conduct a reign of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">terror as barbarous as that of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. As</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a result the area around Zitundo, near Mozambique's southern</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">border with South Africa, became one of the country's killing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fields: a land wasted by atrocities, landmines, and an almost</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">complete exodus of the survivors to refugee centres in South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the war is over and Blanchard has, some say in exchange</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for supporting the Mozambican peace process, been given a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">generous concession to help reconstruct this undeveloped tract</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the south-east corner of one of the world's poorest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plans of his company, Blanchard Mozambique Enterprises</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(BME), are breathtakingly ambitious. It has rights to develop</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">several hotels, a marina, a golf course, and a series of bush</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and beach lodges. The heart of this tourism wonderland will be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">an exclusive game reserve, restocked with all of the wild</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">animals that roamed the area before colonial times, on 15</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">000ha of land on the Machangulo Peninsula. The promontory on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which this nature reserve will be created juts into the Indian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ocean south of Inhaca Island and is surrounded by coral reefs,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">whale sharks, manta rays, humpback whales, dolphins and some</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the last dugongs - mammals who gave rise to the legend of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the mermaids - left in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further south, the company has the right to expand and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">restock the Maputo Elephant Reserve, currently home to a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">relict herd that once migrated freely across the border into</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KwaZulu-Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concession, which stretches inland to the Maputo River</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and down to Ponta Do Ouro on the coast, covers an incredibly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rich area of plant diversity known as the Maputaland Centre of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Endemism because some 4000 species grow only there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Blanchard's extraordinary vision is achieved, this will</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">literally be the only place in the world where it becomes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">possible to scuba dive on coral and cavort with whales and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dolphins in the morning before climbing onto a Land Rover to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">see elephants and the rest of the &quot;big five&quot; in the afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, to prevent spoiling the area with a network of roads,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">visitors will be ferried around this wonderland in flying</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">boats and on a steam train that runs on a light rail network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the scheme has attracted fierce criticism in Maputo. It</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is seen as an invasion of Mozambique's sovereignty. Sceptics</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ask why a man who helped bring the country to its knees should</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">be rewarded in this way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mozambique is being given away and its people don't even</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">know about it,&quot; land expert Jose Negrao was quoted as saying</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in a spate of critical media reports earlier this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also fears that many of the 10 000 residents who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">live in the area will be removed and denied access to their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sacred forests and ancestral graves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eugene Gouws, a South African consultant helping Blanchard</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">implement the programme, sits in Zitundo's central meeting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">place under a rag-tag Renamo flag that flutters next to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">failed icons of African socialism on Frelimo's pennant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He tells the people of Zitundo these criticisms are based</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on misconceptions. The contract between BME and the Mozambican</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government stipulates that tourism profits must be used to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">benefit the region's residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will be given a 7,5% share in the company. Tenders</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will be awarded to lodge developers with strong social</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">responsibility programmes and schemes to include rural people</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in joint venture companies. Jobs will be reserved for locals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modern residential townships will be built with schools,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cr ches and other services of the kind that exist in few parts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will be no removals. Access to sacred places will be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">guaranteed and encouraged. One of BME's aims is to respect and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">restore indigenous culture so that it can act as an attraction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for visitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modern game fences will be installed to prevent wild</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">animals from entering the villages. All of this, says Gouws,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will be done in a way that protects the environment,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reintroduces game species that were shot out of the area a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">long time ago and generates the most vibrant local economy in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the entire country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My colleague Jim Day, a postgraduate journalism student</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">visiting from America, is disbelieving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not yet convinced that the Blanchard School of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regional Development - with its key lessons in free-market</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">capitalism and the past bankrolling of armies like Renamo and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Nicaraguan Contras in the fight against communism - is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">necessarily the best thing for the impoverished people of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">southern Mozambique,&quot; he says in a despatch written after the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">visit. &quot;And when you push Gouws for details on how exactly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">these benefits will be channelled to the people, what</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mechanisms will be set up so that they actually see a share of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the profits, he has only vague answers and a general comment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that 'These are things that still need to be worked out'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Hatton, an academic and independent consultant from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maputo, says the Mozambique state is too weak to enforce the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">social responsibility clauses in Blanchard's contract. There</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is only one non-government organisation, the Swiss-based</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Helvetus, working to protect peoples' rights in the area. And</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">local government is factionalised between a Frelimo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">administrator, a Renamo administrator, and the traditional</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">chiefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far the only impact of Blanchard's scheme on the</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Imagine the life of Sergeant Van der Merwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He comes home after a hard day at work, switches on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">television to relax and gets yet another detective drama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only do his glamorous counterparts get to solve crimes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the space of an hour, but they're surrounded by state-of-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the-art law enforcement technology. With a touch of a computer</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">key, they can get information on a suspect. At the scene of a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">murder, forensic experts give them minute details on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">causes and time of death. And going to court is a streamlined</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No wonder Van der Merwe goes to bed depressed, having spent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">his day laboriously taking down statements with pen and paper:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African police are the poor relations of international</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is why the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Technology's 1997/98 budget, presented to Parliament last</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">week, allocates R10-million to various science councils to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">develop crime-busting technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what do those guys in the white coats know about the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rough and tumble of law enforcement? And can we be sure that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">they will come up with workable solutions rather than esoteric</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hi-tech systems that would completely phase Van der Merwe?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such questions were thoroughly examined by a panel of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">experts earlier this year, when the councils presented their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">plans for helping law enforcement. In the end, the panel gave</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the bulk of the R10-million to the Medical Research Council,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Council for Scientific Industrial Research and the Human</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sciences Research Council for a series of joint projects,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mostly in the area of information technology and statistics</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gathering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The emphasis is on assessment: working with police, victims</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of crime, communities and court officials to find out what</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">they need. The Department of Justice will be consulted in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">designing an improved court management system, and police</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stations will be analysed to see what kind of communication</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and information technology will be most useful. Alongside</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">developing the technology, other projects will look at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">training ordinary individuals to use it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other projects will collect information on the spread of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">crime across the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The comet Hale-Bopp has made a spectacular</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">entry into southern skies, 4 300 years since its last visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first sighting in South Africa was at Sutherland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observatory, at sunset on April 21. Cape Town spotted it two</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">days later, and now it's visible all over South Africa, even</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in smoggy Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comet - really just a big snowball of ice, dust and gas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hurtling through space - is easier to see in the countryside,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">but even through the haze, city-bound South Africans should be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">able to see it, if you know where to look.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Caldwell, a senior astronomer at the SA Astronomical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observatory in Cape Town, offers these directions: &quot;Start by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">looking at Orion, go down about 20 degrees towards the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">horizon. When you get to the star Aldebaran, look to the lower</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">right ... you can see the comet as a fairly bright fuzzy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">object, just after the sun sets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comet is in our skies all day, but it is only visible</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">during a &quot;window period&quot; - the orange hours of dusk after the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sun has set. In Cape Town, you can see it just above the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">horizon at about 7pm, and the further north you are, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">earlier you'd have to scan the skies. In Gauteng, try it out</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at approximately 6.20pm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Northern Hemisphere, the comet has been visible</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">since late July 1995. Astronomer Alan Hale discovered it from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Massachusetts on July 22 - the same night that Tom Bopp, an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">amateur skywatcher, noticed the bright presence. The comet,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which was then far away from Earth, near Jupiter, has since</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been named after them both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hubble space telescope, the Nasa satellite that circles</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the earth taking photographs of deep space, has a year's worth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of pictures of Hale-Bopp and astronomers are using these to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">study the mechanics of comets. They are looking at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dynamics of the nucleus that propels it on its heady course,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">what kind of chemicals it's made up of, and the rate of its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">evaporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their observations suggest that the nucleus is huge - about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">30km to 40km across, about twice as large as Halley's comet -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and gives off brief and intense bursts of activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite their reputation as bright harbingers of disaster</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">or good fortune, comets are just space dust, born at the same</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">time as the universe. Sometimes this dust and ice gets pulled</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">into orbiting another object of a star - in this case, our</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sun's - and begins to circle around it, like the earth orbits</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the sun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from having a huge nucleus, Hale-Bopp also has two</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tails, whose length is about 90-million kilometres. One tail</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is composed of ion gases and looks blue, the other is of dust</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and looks white or yellow-white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will it hit us? No, although that's not a stupid question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Astronomers believe that either a comet or an asteroid struck</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earth 65-million years ago, causing the extinction of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dinosaurs. That comet would have been about one-third of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">size of Hale-Bopp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hale-Bopp will not be getting quite that close. It has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">already passed the earth in its orbit, rounded the sun and is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">moving away from our part of the solar system towards its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">outer fringes. It will be back again - in 2 300 years this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">time, rather than 4 300. This is because it passed too close</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to Jupiter and the planet's gravity pulled it off its course</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">into a different orbit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although it is on its way out, its exit will be more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">spectacular than its entrance. Caldwell says the comet's going</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to be the brightest over South Africa next week (May 5 to 10),</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and then it's going to fade from our view until it's virtually</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">invisible in mid-June.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - I often meet students I have taught over</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the years who ask me nervously: &quot;how are things at Wits?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am always cautiously upbeat. I realise, of course, that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for some of us it was more comfortable to struggle for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">democracy than to have to live in one! But on balance, at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">chalk face, I believe the quality of teaching has risen and we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have not lowered our exit standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vast bulk of my colleagues welcome the demographic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">transformation of our classrooms. It is the fulfilment of a</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">struggle for a genuinely open university that goes back four</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">decades. These new students have improved our ability to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">understand and appreciate &quot;difference&quot;. Instead of social</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">homogeneity, we now face a classroom that is increasingly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">representative of the diversity of our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has enriched teaching and learning. It is a decisive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">step towards teaching excellence in the faculty. To take</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">advantage of this opportunity, we, as teachers, need to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">develop new skills: language, mentoring and a sensitivity to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the knowledge and life experiences of a new constituency of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This demographic transformation presents us with a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">challenge. Many of these students speak English as a second or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">third language. They often come from desperately poor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">backgrounds and have been to schools where the teachers were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unqualified, poorly motivated and badly resourced. This is the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">legacy of apartheid. I believe we have responded to this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">challenge in creative ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To begin with, we appointed academic development tutors to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">teach alongside mainstream tutors where &quot;under-prepared&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">students were given a variety of academic skills to off-set</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their lack of preparation at high school level. We soon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">realised this response was inadequate and began introducing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">year-long foundation courses. We hope eventually to be able to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">offer a full foundation year so that students from &quot;under-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">prepared&quot; backgrounds will spend a year making up for lost</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ground in their high school education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To date, we have been unable to afford a full foundation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">year. But it is gratifying to note that the Department of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Education's recent White Paper argues for strengthening</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">academic development structures to promote quality teaching</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and learning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our decision to put major resources into these areas arose</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">out of a two-fold realisation: firstly, &quot;under-preparedness&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is not a temporary phenomenon that will pass away in a year or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">two. This &quot;myth of transience&quot; was initially widely held in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the faculty. Under-preparedness is not a short-term problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly, an increasing number of under- prepared students</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">were passing, but most in the third class. Foundation courses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">were designed to give them an opportunity to do well by taking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">an extra year over their degree, not simply pass it. We are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">now developing a new generation of postgraduate students</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">assisted by, for example, the research internship system of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Centre of Scientific Development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unexpectedly, the challenge of teaching under-prepared</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">students has raised the standard of pedagogy. When I started</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">teaching at Wits 20 years ago, we seldom used overheads,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">activity-based learning and other interactive styles of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">teaching. Today, all my colleagues are aware of how to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">communicate better in the classroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1990 we created, along with other faculties, a Faculty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teaching and Learning Committee. Most departments have a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">teaching and learning sub-committee. What we initially thought</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was necessary for under- prepared students we now realise is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">simply good practice for all teachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are no &quot;quick-fix&quot; solutions in education. We may</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">only reap the harvest of this human resource investment in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">five to 10 years. Meanwhile, some prizes are not being awarded</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at our annual graduation ceremonies. This has always been the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">case and is not a sign of a &quot;drop in standards&quot;. On the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">contrary: it is a recognition of our commitment to maintaining</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">standards. We do not award prizes to the best student in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">class: we award prizes only when the best student achieves a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">first-class pass. It is a case of &quot;levelling up&quot; and not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;levelling down&quot;. We intend to maintain the same exit standard</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in 1997 as we did in 1977.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, during the period of transformation, we have lost many</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">good students to other faculties, other universities, and,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">indeed, to other countries. This is a regrettable but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">temporary phenomenon. In our concern with &quot;redress&quot;, we may</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have neglected the top 10% of students. This is part of our</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">next challenge - to make our curriculum relevant to a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">multicultural South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are limits to what we can do. There has been a global</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shift from elite to mass education. This puts a strain on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">academic teachers all over the world. We have more routine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">work, larger classes and less discretionary labour time to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">engage in research activities. In spite of this, most of my</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">colleagues retain a steady output of accredited publications</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and some are leading scholars internationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I do not think it is helpful to label the small number who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have resisted these changes as racist. Indeed I think the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">statement from the Department of Education (Mail &amp; Guardian,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">April 18 to 24) is counter-productive as it stifles</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">constructive debate. The allegation of racism is too serious</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to be used in a cavalier fashion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My impression is the vast bulk of the faculty are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recognising the need to &quot;retool&quot; their skills and adapt to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">changing demography of the classroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I observe daily the transformation in the classroom of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">students previously excluded from a good university education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I consider it an honour to be part of this process. I do not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">believe we have achieved teaching excellence in the new</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">circumstances, but I am confident that we are moving towards</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that goal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The recent report that black corporations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">now control 8,6% of values at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">comes as a clear signal of the increasing pace of black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">advancement into the highest echelons of South African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">society. Until now, the most visible aspect of black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">advancement was in the political domain, where the African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Congress victory brought into public office a large</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">number of mainly black activists, now firmly established in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government at all levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was followed by a new cadre of top public servants in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government departments and parastatals and they too became</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">highly visible. And now we have the entry into top positions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the private sector. Soon the pattern will be reflected</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">throughout the professions and other sectors of society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is this what the liberation movement wanted? The answer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">must be in the affirmative. Even if it was not always stated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">explicitly, one of the goals of the liberation struggle was to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">enable black advancement into the highest positions throughout</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">society. Yet some qualifications must be noted. The struggle</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was about the liberation of the black people as a whole, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not just an elite, with the essential corollary that all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sections of society would be liberated from a hateful system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it is appropriate to ask now: is black advancement into</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the top echelons opening up the prospect of liberating all?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer must depend on how the benefits of black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">advancement are to be apportioned, and that, in turn, depends</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on the values associated with the process. Here we are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reminded that a great deal of nonsense has been written about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">black people enriching themselves in the last few weeks. Some</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">black business people deeply resent criticism about their new</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wealth and status ascribing the criticism to racism (if it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">comes from whites) or envy (if it comes from blacks).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For anyone with experience of post- independence Africa,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the phenomenon of the Wabenzi class is old hat. We were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">previously deprived, they say, and now it's our turn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC argued for decades that South African society is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">essentially colonial but with a distinctive feature in that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the colonial ruling class is located within the country and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not in some imperial country elsewhere. The system has been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">categorised as &quot;internal colonialism&quot;. Undoubtedly the system,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with its huge race barriers, its massive polarisation of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wealth and power, and its system of privileges and parasitism,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was colonial in its every fibre. The ANC always argued that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">whites enjoyed exceptional wealth and status, due to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">colonial system, which enabled them to extract additional</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wealth and power way beyond what an ordinary capitalist system</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">allowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is a matter of concern now is not that blacks are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">becoming entrepreneurs and rich, but that their yardstick is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the colonial levels of wealth and lifestyle, including the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">whole panoply of perks that white colonial South Africans gave</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">themselves in addition to their incomes. These include</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">servants, company cars, five star hotels, business class</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">travel, holidays, and all the rest of the consumptionism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">associated with an exceptionally privileged group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is worse, is that even public servants use as a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">standard the incomes and perks of their white predecessors in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">what was a colonial state. What is happening therefore is a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">levelling up of a new aspirant black group in both public and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">private spheres launched on a wave of material aspirations,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and which is pushing up costs right across the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is evidence that in many other countries much richer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">than ours, there are deliberate efforts to inhibit the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">polarisation of society, by such measures as limiting the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">salary gap between top people and ordinary employees, and by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">laying down strict rules about property ownership and the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">like. Equally, politicians in many countries base their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">standard of living on a much lower level of personnel than we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">do. In some countries, politicians still give their whole</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">salary to their party and receive back only what is considered</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">appropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key question, however, is not so much whether there is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">an undesirable thirst for wealth, but how the masses see this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">phenomenon. In my experience all over Africa, the emergence of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the &quot;Wabenzi&quot; was resented principally because it was thought</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that a new class was taking the place of the colonial class</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and behaving in the same way. I fear that we are beginning to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">arouse the same feelings among the mass of the people here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point is, therefore, that while black enrichment may</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">indeed arouse some envy on the part of poorer people, this is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not the main thrust of their resentment. It is rather the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">entry of new personnel into the style of colonials that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">offends.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - There is a long-forgotten picture of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda's Yoweri Museveni, then still a guerilla leader,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shaking hands with then president Bazilio Okella on December</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">17 1985.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders had just signed a treaty to end the civil war</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and create a transitional government in Kampala. A few weeks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">later, Museveni tore the treaty up, took the capital by force</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and declared himself the unchallenged ruler of Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are two lessons in this for students of war and peace</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Zaire. The first is that a victorious peasant army will not</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stop marching until they have broken down the statues of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dictator, ransacked his bathroom and run up the rebel flag</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from the spire of the legislative buildings. The other is that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">one of Laurent Kabila's closest advisors before his army began</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">its unstoppable march across Zaire was Yoweri Museveni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be naive to expect the peace talks which South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa is brokering this weekend to end the conflict in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hopefully, their most immediate impact could be a humanitarian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">one - saving as many lives of refugees and innocent victims</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">caught up in the fighting as possible. But they could be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">extremely important in a deeper process of soul-searching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conflict goes way beyond the removal of Mobutu from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">office. It is part of the very process of Africa remaking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">itself. The springboard for Kabila's extraordinary leap</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">towards Kinshasa was the tangled ethnic and cross-border</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">conflicts of eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spark that ignited Kabila's decades- long insurgency,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">transforming it into a viable challenge to Mobutu, was when</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Hutu militia and Mobutu's troops rounded on the Zairean</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tutsis last year and found themselves faced with a powerful</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and organised grouping of forces who adopted Kabila as the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">figurehead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Museveni wanted to drive his own rebels, who were receiving</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">succour from both the Sudanese and Mobutu, away from his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">borders. The Rwandan government was concerned that Hutu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">militia were using the safety of United Nations camps in Zaire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as a base to plot further genocidal incursions against the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan Tutsis. They both supported a rebel advance that would</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">drive the militia back deep into Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the course of his march across Zaire, the rebel leader</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">forged a coalition of allies with long-standing grudges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">against Mobutu. These included the Angolans, who have had to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bear 20 years of Zairean support for Unita and the destruction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of their country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Kabila's insurgency grew above and beyond those that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">helped send him on his way, or are even serving in his army,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and in a manner that noone could have predicted. As Zaire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">collapsed before him, a path opened to the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Museveni now has severe doubts about Kabila. The Hutu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">camps under his control that were opened to the international</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">scrutiny last week raise serious doubts about his ability to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">control his troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is without a national political organisation, ranged</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">across a land riven by deep ethnic tensions, and surrounded by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nations with their own agendas and age-old enmities. What hope</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has he to govern such a large, amorphous land as Zaire, which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has not had a proper government for decades and where the only</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">instruments of national cohesion will disappear with Mobutu?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simplistic solutions such as multi-party elections could</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">only exacerbate, not resolve, the tensions. You cannot have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">elections until you have drawn up a Constitution to create a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">federal state, to rein in secessionist tendencies, and to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">grant protection and security to minorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next-door neighbour Angola was propelled back to civil war</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by an election that went awry. Multi-party elections can bring</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dictators or demagogues back to power. Democracy in Zaire can</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">help transform the whole continent, but only after the ground</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has been firmly laid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increasingly, African leaders are looking at other</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">priorities, such as the modernisation of the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we are to follow Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and take</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the African renaissance seriously, then Uganda is a key</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">player. Museveni inherited a wasteland from Idi Amin and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Milton Obote, and has made enormous strides in turning his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">country around. Yet he has achieved this without multi-party</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his recent autobiography, Museveni acknowledged that you</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">can't build a sustainable democracy with 92% of your</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">population as peasants. You can't build a modern state without</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a middle class of personal income taxpayers. And democracy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">means nothing when International Monetary Fund and World Bank</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">strictures leave no revenue to pay for basic social amenities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with Eritria, Ethiopia and Rwanda, Uganda has been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">through not just colonial domination, but a post-colonial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nightmare - and has emerged stronger, searching for an African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">solution to its problems, but with few illusions about what a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hard continent this is. Post-Mobutu Zaire could also fall into</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that category.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African aim of searching for an inclusive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">settlement is the correct one.  Pressure has to be brought to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bear on Kabila that he cannot hope to go it alone in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But regional powers such as Uganda, Rwanda and Angola have to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">be brought in to the discussion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - Amid all the horrors of Matabeleland one name</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stands out as being particularly synonymous with human</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">depravity: Bhalagwe camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was originally a base for ex-Zipra troops incorporated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">into the Zimbabwe National Army. But in 1982 the troops there</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">were accused of being dissidents.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The camp was surrounded by paratroop and commando units and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shut down. From mid-1982 it became the country's most</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">notorious detention centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The camp lies less than a kilometre from a main road, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was invisible to it. Nearby is the Antelope mine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was made up of 180 large, round asbestos &quot;holding sheds&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">measuring about 12 metres by six metres and another 36 half</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that size. Roughly 136 detainees were kept in each of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">larger sheds. They slept on the floor, squeezed together on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their sides. There were no beds, blankets, or toilet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children, as well as adults, were kept in Bhalagwe. The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">detainees were trucked in from all over Matabeleland South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Survivors' accounts consistently refer to daily deaths at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">camp. Villagers living near the Antelope mine report there</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">were nightly visits by trucks, with workers tipping the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">corpses down a shaft, and explosions as hand-grenades were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">thrown after them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conditions at Bhalagwe were evoked by one 16-year-old</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">survivor of the camp who was quoted by the commission: &quot;At</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bhalagwe the charge office was full of blood. We had to sit in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lines outside the office waiting our turn to be beaten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you were in front of the line you knew it was your</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">turn next. The beatings started at 5.30am.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw two people being shot and seven being beaten to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">death. Very many died, but I helped to bury only these nine I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">saw die. I dug their graves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) teamed up with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five Brigade to conduct interrogations at Bhalagwe. According</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to the commission, they used electric shock treatment and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">water torture -which involved forcing the subject's head under</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">water, or forcing a shirt into the victim's mouth and pouring</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">water on to it until he, or she, lost consciousness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The perpetrator would then jump on the victim's stomach</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">until she, or he, vomited up the water. This practice commonly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stopped once the victim was vomiting blood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report says there was repeated reference by survivors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of Bhalagwe to &quot;a particularly cruel woman CIO officer who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">used to sexually torment her male victims&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The practice of &quot;forcing sharp sticks into women's vaginas&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was particularly common at Bhalagwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Witnesses refer to women at Bhalagwe adopting a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">characteristic, painful, wide- legged gait after receiving</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">such torture. In addition, men were also subjected to beatings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which focused on their genitalia. The testicles would be bound</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in rubber strips and then beaten with a truncheon ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At least one man is reported as dying after his scrotum</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was burst during a beating. Several witnesses also report</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">being told to have sex with donkeys while at Bhalagwe and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">being beaten when they failed to do so ... &quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - One of the untold horrors of Africa - the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">atrocities perpetrated by Robert Mugabe's troops in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">southern province of Matabeleland after independence -can</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">finally be told.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nightmarish story of how Mugabe's Korean-trained troops</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">put down an insurrection in the early 1980s has been detailed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in a report drawn up by Zimbabwe's Catholic Commission for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice and Peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shock findings were presented to Mugabe in March, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the country's eight Catholic bishops have backed off a pledge</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to release it publicly. A copy has, however, been obtained by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Mail &amp; Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report is based on testimony gathered from more than</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1000 people over a five-year period. It sweeps aside a curtain</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of silence which has seen families being refused death</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">certificates for corpses of their loved ones, because</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">officialdom refuses to recognise their murders. Only one</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">member of Mugabe's Cabinet has ever expressed the slightest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">regret for the atrocities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission focused its investigation on two case-study</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">areas, the Tsholotsho and Nyamandlovu districts in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matabeleland North and Matobo in Matabeleland South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matabeleland in the early 1980s was the centre of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">antagonism between Joshua Nkomo's Zipra and Mugabe's Zanla</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">guerrilla armies. Tensions were exacerbated by a South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African-backed destabilisation campaign. Dissidents carried</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">out atrocities in the region - including the killing of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">missionaries - but on a minuscule scale compared to those of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">state security forces acting in the name of law and order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August 1981, 106 instructors arrived from North Korea</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and began training what was to be known as Five Brigade, or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gukurahundi - Shona for &quot;the rain which washes away the chaff</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">before the spring rains&quot;. Made up mostly of Shona-speaking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recruits from Zanla, wearing distinctive uniforms including</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">red berets, armed with AK-47s and driving Korean vehicles,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which quickly fell to pieces in the rough Zimbabwe terrain,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the crack unit was to terrorise Matabeleland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government introduced a series of curfews in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matabeleland, journalists were prohibited from leaving the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">provincial capital of Bulawayo and Five Brigade set to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the words of the report: &quot;Within weeks of being mobilised</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at the end of January 1983 under Colonel Perence Shiri, Five</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brigade was responsible for mass murders, beatings and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">property burnings in the communal living areas of Northern</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matabeleland where hundreds of thousands of Zapu supporters</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Five Brigade passed first through Tsholotsho, spreading</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">out rapidly through Lupane and Nkayi, and their impact on all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">these communal areas was shocking. Within the space of six</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">weeks more than 2000 civilians had died, hundreds of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">homesteads had been burnt and thousands of civilians had been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">beaten. Most of the dead were killed in public executions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">involving between one and 12 people at a time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report offers a chilling recitation of atrocities,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">describing how villagers would be assembled at a central point</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- such as a school, or borehole - harangued and subjected to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mass beatings which were often followed by killings of those</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">whose names were read from death lists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Villagers frequently report being forced to sing songs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">praising Zanu-PF while dancing on the mass graves of their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">families and fellow villagers, killed and buried minutes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">earlier.&quot; Five Brigade would regularly forbid the badly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">injured from seeking medical attention, in some cases</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">returning the day after the initial assaults to finish them</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a tribal belief in Matabeleland that the tears of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the living need to be spilled to release the souls of the dead</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and allow them to be at rest. Five Brigade made a practice of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">forbidding mourning and the commission says there were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">instances of relatives being shot because they wept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burial was also often forbidden, so families were forced to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">watch the corpses of their loved ones rotting in the sun and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">being mauled by scavengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission reports that there were some exceptions to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the depravity and cites, as an example, an instance in early</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1983 when a commander at Ndawana village in Tsholotsho ordered</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">all the inhabitants into a hut and then set fire to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the burning thatch began to fall in on screaming</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">villagers the commander left and another member of Five</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brigade immediately opened the hut door and released the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">villagers before any were burnt to death. He took huge</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">personal risk . &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But otherwise the report contains a litany of atrocity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reminiscent of Rwanda, or the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia. Some</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">examples from the Tsholotsho and Nyamandlovu districts in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matabeleland North:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Neshango line. February 3 1983. Mass beating of villagers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and shooting of two young pregnant girls, followed by their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">being bayoneted open to reveal the still moving foetuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Kumbula school, Pumula village. February 13 1983. Whole</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">village beaten and seven shot dead, including a teacher, after</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">digging their own graves. Witnesses refer to a fountain of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">blood from the pit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Gulakabili. February 12 1983. Whole village abducted from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nearby to the Pumula mission area where they were beaten. Some</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">were then forced to dig a mass grave, made to climb in and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">were shot. They were buried while still moving and villagers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">were made to dance on the grave and sing songs in praise of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zanu-PF. Number of dead given as 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Tangahukwe. February 1983. All the villagers were rounded</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">up and severely beaten. Twelve were selected and shot after</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">being forced into two mass graves . One of the chosen managed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to run away, so his younger brother was killed instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Korodziba. February 1983. Five Brigade came to the school</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and took about 60 pupils aged over 14 years. They were all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">beaten and asked abut dissidents. Twenty to 30 girls were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">raped and then ordered to have sex with some of the boys while</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the soldiers watched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Soloboni. February 23 1983. Five Brigade rounded up</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">entire village to the borehole. Six people were chosen at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">random and were bayoneted to death and buried in one grave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone was then beaten. Five people were beaten to death ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(one) man who wept to see his brother killed was severely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">beaten and died a few weeks later from his injuries. One old</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lady who was found in her hut was raped and Five Brigade then</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">set fire to a plastic bag and burned the old lady with it,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">setting fire to her blanket. She died three weeks later from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the burns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Egagwini. March 1983. One young man was taken by Five</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brigade, badly beaten, returned and while his parents were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">washing his wounds, the Five Brigade came back and shot him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Mkhonyeni. January 1983. The first woman to die in this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">area was accused of feeding dissidents. She was pregnant and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was bayoneted open to kill the baby. She died later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">February 1983. All the villagers were forced to witness the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">burning to death of 26 villagers, in the three huts of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dhlamini.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Bonkwe/Nyanganyuni. A young woman from Bonkwe going to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">buy mielie meal was beaten for wearing her husband's watch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her husband was summoned to Nyanganyuni and beaten to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every bone in his body was broken - he is referred to as being</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;like a cloth&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Tshomwina and Dzokotze. January/February 1983. All the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">villagers of Tshomwina were forced-marched to Dzokotze nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were beaten and five were killed. One man died after</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">terrible mutilations which included having his jaw broken and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">his tongue cut out. This man ran away and was found by his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">family in a neighbouring village. He took eight days to die,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">without medical care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Mpungayile. 1983. The Five Brigade shot dead a mentally</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">retarded boy and then shot three other men. Because the women</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wept they were shot too, four of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Nkwalini. February 1983. A man from here, trying to take</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">his wife away to Bulawayo, was shot dead at Mlagisa siding and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">so was his wife when she cried when she saw him shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Sipepa Area. February 1983. Whole village forced to dig</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">roots, some were then beaten and two schoolboys who looked too</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">old for their class were shot dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission says that killing was less widespread in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matabeleland South, but many &quot;horrific atrocities&quot; were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recorded. &quot;A four-month-old infant was axed three times and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the mother forced to eat the flesh of her dead child. An 18-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">year-old girl was raped by six soldiers and then killed. An</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11-year-old child had her vagina burnt with plastic and was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">later shot. Twin infants were buried alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other specific incidents reported in the south included:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Dry Paddock area. February 1984. A young woman and her</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">father-in-law were asked about dissidents and beaten. They</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">were then stripped naked and told to have sex with each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The father-in-law said he would die first. A shot was fired,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">missing them, and the two were then severely beaten and left</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Donkwe Donkwe. February 1984. Five Brigade rounded</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">everyone in the area to a local school. There were about 200</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">men, women and children. Everyone as beaten and kicked from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sunrise to 10am. Then some were made to dig two graves, while</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">others were made to fight each other. Six men were chosen at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">random and placed in two groups of three. They were then shot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dead. Everyone else was told to sing songs praising Mugabe and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">condemning Nkomo . While some sang and danced, others were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">beaten. Some of the villagers were made to bury the six dead</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and then had to join in the singing while being beaten. At 4pm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">about 19 young men were taken away and another man was shot as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">they departed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Mloyi area. February 1984. Approximately 100 adults and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">schoolchildren were rounded up . they were told they were in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for a treat ... People were then beaten, including a 12-year-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">old girl and her sister and their father. The two girls were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">so badly beaten they were later hospitalised. Their father was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">then shot dead in front of everyone and his children were made</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to search his pockets to see if they could find any evidence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that he was a dissident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Mbembeswana area. February 1984. An ex- Zipra soldier was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">taken from his home in nearby Silonkwe to Mbembeswana. He was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">badly beaten and then his family were summoned to fetch him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had both arms broken and no teeth. He refused to leave,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">saying he was dead already. Five Brigade then shot him in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zipra was the military wing of Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African Peoples' Union and Zanla was the military wing loyal</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Several &quot;third force&quot; trials may not take</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">place because the Transvaal attorney general's office is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">grossly under- resourced. Dozens of former and present members</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the security forces are likely to escape being charged for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knowing that they will not be prosecuted will also enable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">them to avoid applying for amnesty to the Truth and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reconciliation Commission. Few of those being investigated by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the attorney general have applied and the cut-off date for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">doing so is May 10. Until now it is mostly the threat of</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">prosecution which has sent some perpetrators of gross human</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rights violations scurrying to the truth commission for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For more than three years, investigations into the &quot;third</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">force&quot; and apartheid-era crimes have been under way in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transvaal attorney general's office in Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several former police generals, including &quot;Krappies&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Engelbrecht and Nick van Rensburg, have been on the list of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">those who could face prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So have Inkatha Freedom Party leaders Themba Khoza and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phillip Powell, who have faced being charged, with others, in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a spectacular &quot;guns for Natal&quot; trial - using much information</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gathered in last year's successful prosecution of the former</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vlakplaas commander and mass murderer, Eugene de Kock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a third of the senior legal posts at the attorney</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">general's office are unfilled, some for three years. In</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">addition, there have been resignations by senior legal staff</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">involved in the investigations. One advocate was close to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">writing up a docket in what would have been a major &quot;third</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">force&quot; trial; his resignation has put the prosecution on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">back burner, perhaps for ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even worse is the toll the gruelling years of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investigations, which are additional to the normal workload,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have taken on those involved in tracking down politically</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">motivated killers in the police and military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least one deputy attorney general has collapsed under</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the mental and physical strain of untangling the network of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's most sophisticated criminals. This official</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will not be able to continue with the work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two policemen assigned to the attorney general's office as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;third force&quot; investigators have also cracked under the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">physical and emotional stress, and the danger in trying to pin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">down prosecutions against their former colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attorney general's office has about seven major ongoing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investigations, several of which will die out. The tentacles</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of one of the &quot;third force&quot; cases reach into the heart of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's present crime wave. Another huge investigation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is into South Africa's chemical and biological warfare</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">programme, which stretches into illegal international</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">procurement of materials of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attorney general's office has, in the mass of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">documentation it has collected since the Goldstone Commission</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of Inquiry closed down and handed over its files, enough</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">material and leads to uncover substantially the remaining</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mysteries of the &quot;third force&quot; and outstanding apartheid-era</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">murders - and to mount prosecutions. Insiders at the office</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">believe the basic material and confessions collected could</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">expose the modus operandi and funding of a mass of covert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the information is likely to remain locked away in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">filing cabinets and most &quot;third force&quot; killers and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">conspirators will remain safe from prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Transvaal's media-shy Attorney General, Dr Jan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D'Oliveira, in a rare press interview, confirmed this week</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that the whole range of &quot;third force&quot; prosecutions was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">threatened by staff and resource shortages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is taxing, difficult work, it needs experienced</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investigators. And we don't have them,&quot; he said. &quot;We need 10</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">advocates and 10 more investigators for special investigations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D'Oliveira is understood to have made an approach to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Nelson Mandela about his resource problems, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">records show he alerted the Department of Justice three years</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ago to the growing crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said that although the possibility existed of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">engaging lawyers from the private sector to beef up his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">prosecution capacity, the leeway was more apparent than real.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had to work through the Justice Department, whose budget</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was notoriously underfunded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This work needs the most experienced legal minds. It is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">extremely demanding work, stressful. We don't have the money</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to hire senior people,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enver Daniels, special adviser to Justice Minister Dullah</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omar, confirmed there were vacancies in the attorney general's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">office, &quot;but we wanted to fill them with people who were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">representative of the population as a whole. The attorney</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">general's office is not representative of the population. In</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">terms of a recent high court action, we have to submit action</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">plans to fill vacant posts to the bargaining chamber of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Service Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those plans include information on how to fill the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">vacancies. The minister has given the go-ahead for hiring from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the private sector, and Business against Crime has also made</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">an offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The attorneys general (throughout the country) are also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">resisting the establishment of a national prosecution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">authority.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A senior journalist on the Johannesburg</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">newspaper The Star, Norman Chandler, spied for the security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">police during the 1980s, according to two former senior</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">security policemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say a Lesotho daily newspaper, The Nation, of which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chandler was managing director, was partly funded by the South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African security police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One former operative, Vic McPherson, now a superintendent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at John Vorster Square, says he was Chandler's handler. Former</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">spy Craig Williamson says he was the paymaster who authorised</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">funds for Chandler.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Williamson and McPherson say Chandler was a &quot;useful&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">agent for several months late in 1985. He provided important</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">intelligence on the movement of South African refugees and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Umkhonto weSizwe (MK) members in and out of Lesotho.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McPherson says he also provided information about the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lesotho government, in particular its relationship with the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African National Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says while Chandler was employed at the Rand Daily Mail</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">during the early 1980s, he reported on his colleagues and on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;foreign visitors&quot; to the newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian first contacted Chandler for comment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">last week. &quot;That's interesting, that's fascinating,&quot; was all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he repeatedly said when told of the accusations against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, however, he emphatically denied working for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">security police, and said on Wednesday: &quot;I would like to know</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their motivation for saying this. It will destroy me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he used his own funds, part of his severance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">package from the then South African Associated Newspapers, to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">start The Nation in 1985 with a partner, Desmond Sixishe, a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">former information minister. (Sixishe was shot dead in1986 by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">soldiers loyal to the South African-backed military leader</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justin Lekhanya.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Johannesburg-based Freedom of Expression Institute</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(FXI) is investigating whether there is any link between the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">intelligence which Chandler supplied and a South African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">police raid into Lesotho in December 1985. The raid resulted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the killing of nine people: six were ANC members, including</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">two senior MK members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FXI investigation is part of a wider submission on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">press to be presented to the Truth and Reconciliation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Williamson, Chandler worked for the security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">police from the early 1980s. &quot;I considered recruiting him into</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">my operation in the military after I left the police in 1985.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he was doing a useful job for the police, so I left him</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">alone,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McPherson in his turn has told many journalists he helped</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fund a newspaper in Lesotho.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williamson first made the allegation about Chandler when he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was being secretly debriefed by the ANC at the end of 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During those debriefing sessions, Williamson admitted to his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">part in the assassination of trade unionist Jeanette Schoon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and her daughter Katryn in Angola in 1984 , of Ruth First in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maputo in 1982, and his role in the bomb which exploded in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC's London headquarters in the same year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All these stories have subsequently been confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was in that briefing that Williamson made allegations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">about Chandler and other journalists whom he said played</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">various roles in the former government's propaganda war. He</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gave the ANC a strategy document drawn up by the police in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which they analysed the campaign to discredit anti- apartheid</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cleric Allan Boesak in the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chandler's name appears on a list of &quot;friends and sources&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the security police in the media. The names of another 10</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">journalists are on the list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Sullivan, editor of The Star, said this week he could</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not understand why the M&amp;G would &quot;choose to take the word of a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">liar and murderer above the word of a Star journalist who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">claims he is innocent&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Chandler's colleagues in Lesotho, John Mu-kela, who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was news editor of The Nation, said it began operations in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 1985 and closed at the end of the year after the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">chairman of a Lesotho bank, which was going to lend money,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">withdrew funds following a row with Sixishe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mukela said he had never had any reason to suspect Chandler</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was working for anyone other than the newspaper. &quot;He ran a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">good newspaper,&quot; he said. &quot;We had no suspicions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G's editor, Phillip van Niekerk, who first confirmed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williamson's role in the Schoon and First murders and the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London bomb, said he had informed Chandler's superiors about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the allegations against him in February 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chandler continued to cover events for The Star, such as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the trial of mass murderer Eugene de Kock, who was jailed for</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - ABDI Hussein (30) grabs a fistful of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">spaghetti and, with great skill, swings it into his mouth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hussein is one of the 3 000 Somali refugees who have come to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa since their country erupted into civil war six</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I meet Hussein in a hotel that is unlikely to be listed in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">any travel guide. The hotel's Fordsburg address is passed from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">one Somali refugee to the next. The room is full of men</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">watching The Bold and the Beautiful on television, sipping</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shah (sweet tea) and eating spaghetti -a result of Italian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">influence from the days when it administered parts of Somalia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">before independence in 1960.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bowl of spaghetti costs the refugees R4 and it's R20 a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">night for a room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Signs on the wall prohibit smoking and chewing mirra - a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sort of twig that stimulates the senses. Mirra is to East</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African culture what boerewors is to the Free State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hussein's home village is on Somalia's border with Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He recently completed his master's degree in History at Rhodes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University and has been accepted for a PhD in Conflict</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysis and Resolution at George Mason University in Virginia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Africa is going to need those skills,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, they didn't help him last month. The evening he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">celebrated handing in his thesis, he was assaulted. Somebody</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">broke a beer bottle over his head. He boasts a forehead full</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of scars. &quot;I came very close to losing my life,&quot; he recalls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless Hussein claims he is one of the more fortunate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somalis in South Africa. He left the country before the war to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">take up a teaching post in Swaziland and managed to raise</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">enough funds to study. When civil war broke out, many of his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">compatriots fled, leaving behind families and qualifications</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to put themselves at the mercy of foreign governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've crossed many borders to come here and on the way</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">many people contracted malaria,&quot; says refugee leader Mohammed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hirsi (41), who left Somalia in 1992. He travelled along the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">coast from Tanzania to Mozambique and then went to Swaziland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It took him two weeks to get to South Africa. &quot;We travelled</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">without documents and were harassed by officials in many</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">countries. A lot of refugees were turned back when they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reached Tanzania. It's only the lucky few who make it,&quot; he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Somalis in South Africa recently formed a committee to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">represent their interests. Hirsi was given the social</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">activities portfolio and is responsible for looking after</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">newcomers. Why did they choose South Africa? &quot;Because it's the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">most economically developed country in Africa and offers a lot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of opportunities,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are not many opportunities for 60- year-old Mohammed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jama, or MJ as he is affectionately called. He clutches a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">walking stick to his chest and explains that he spends most of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">his time going to hospital to get treatment for his legs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When fighting broke out in his village, he fled on the back</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of an overloaded truck. Soldiers ambushed the truck, killing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the driver. The truck overturned. MJ jumped. His legs were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">crushed. He was lucky, though, because many people in the back</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the truck were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Mayfair, about 8km from the Fordsburg hotel, is the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somali Community Centre. Forty young men are squeezed into a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">small room. The only noise that breaks the silence is the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sound of lips smacking together. Bundles and bundles of mirra</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are stacked in the middle of the room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mirra, which costs R50 a bundle, was flown in from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi and arrived that afternoon at Johannesburg</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International Airport. &quot;It's not illegal,&quot; Hussein says, &quot;they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bring it in as vegetables and cover it in dried banana skins</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to keep it fresh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mirra is farmed in northern Somalia, Ethiopia, Yemen and,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">according to Hussein, is now grown by a farmer in the East</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hussein. who says he started chewing mirra when he was 12,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">peels the bark off the twig and chews the bark strips.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not like dagga or beer, it doesn't make you dizzy or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">aggressive,&quot; he says.  &quot;It's very sociable. It helps you tell</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stories. It's also a painkiller and very good for flu, because</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it keeps you warm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MJ and Hirsi and some other Somali elders are sitting in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">another room, also chewing mirra. Hirsi explains that in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mogadishu he was a wealthy businessman and now in South Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he is a hawker. He says he studied political science for four</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">years in Cuba, before working for Somalia's communist</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government. He switched to a business career in 1984. When the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somali capital turned into a battlefield after faction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fighting erupted, Hirsi fled to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our plight is a hellish nightmare,&quot; he says.&quot;We've come to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa as asylum- seekers and we are only given</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">temporary status. Because of this, we cannot get help from the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Red Cross or any other non- government organisations and we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">struggle to find jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dozen Somalis gathered around the table nod in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">agreement. Hirsi continues: &quot;Some of us are hawkers, some of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">us are security guards and some help out in stores. As casual</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">labourers, we earn between R150 and R180 a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I sell shoes and clothes that I buy from Chinese</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wholesalers. I was chased away from hawking in Secunda because</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the locals there accused me of stealing their jobs. These days</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hawk in Benoni.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hirsi says that most of the refugees who do not have jobs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">spend the day glued to the television set and at night they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">chew mirra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One day while we were sitting in the house, thugs with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">guns came inside. We could not defend ourselves. They stole</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">our money and beat us. We went to the police station, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">because we only had temporary documents we were told to go to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Department of Home Affairs. One policeman said that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">whoever doesn't have a permanent document has no rights in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa. We are powerless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the reasons the Somalis congregate in Mayfair is to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">be near the mosques. They have received some support from the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African Muslim community. &quot;We stick to ourselves. We</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">live in one country, but we are in a different world. You are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the first white person we've had contact with,&quot; says Hirsi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Hirsi, the United Nations High Commission for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees suggested the South African government set up camps</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for the Somali refugees. &quot;But the government rejected the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">whole idea. We don't have the power to contact the big shots</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in government to help us. We are refugees. We share rent and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sometimes 15 people share a room. If a newcomer comes to South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa we help him. We don't even ask R1. We know how tough it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is to survive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I get the impression that the Somali refugees are reluctant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to answer questions about the problems in Somalia. They come</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from many clans, but in South Africa they only have each other</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to rely on, so they stick together, rather than quarrel about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">politics thousands of kilometres away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hussein believes that they will return to Somalia one day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes,&quot; agrees Hirsi. &quot;One day when there's peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Western Cape's police commissioner,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leon Wessels, has defied calls by the government's Independent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Complaints Directorate that he reprimand two officers involved</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the botched Robben Island rape investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wessels this week also retracted the &quot;unreserved apology&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he extended last month to the rape victim, Nomboniso Gasa. He</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">claimed he had &quot;only apologised to Gasa for the perception on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">her part that insensitivity was displayed to her&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He declined to comment on his reasons for retracting his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">apology, but added his decision not to reprimand the two</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">officers represented standard police procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stance represents a major snub for the directorate: its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">report on the high-profile case was among its first</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investigations after it was set up by the Minister of Safety</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Security, Sydney Mufamadi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wessels's decision also fuels concerns that the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">directorate, supposedly a key mechanism in correcting police</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">misbehaviour, is toothless. The directorate itself conceded</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this week that it is powerless to ensure that its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recommendations are implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mufamadi, who publicly lauded the directorate's findings on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Gasa case, was unavailable for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gasa, wife of African National Congress MP Raymond Suttner,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is overseas. But her lawyer is believed to have questioned</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wessels about his refusal to explain why he has not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">implemented the directorate's recommendations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gasa was raped on Robben Island on January 20, but no one</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has been brought to book. As the investigation dragged on,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">police instead leaked reports suggesting that Gasa had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fabricated the story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The directorate began investigating after Gasa and Suttner</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">officially complained about the conduct of the investigating</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The directorate found that the initial investigation had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;lacked competence and professionalism&quot; and that there was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;prima facie evidence of negligence and/or dereliction of duty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on the part of the members of the initial investigating</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">team...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The directorate also found that Constable M McClean and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Captain Kevin Jones were &quot;dishonest in their evidence before</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">us and did not take us into their confidence&quot; and should be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;strongly reprimanded&quot;. It recommended that Wessels apologise</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to Gasa for the &quot;insensitivity displayed to her&quot; - an apology</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he made the following day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wessels said this week that he had implemented the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">directorate's recommendations: Jones and McClean had been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;called in to discuss their conduct in the case, but they were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not reprimanded&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Police Commissioner George Fivaz's office said it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was satisfied with Wessels's handling of the issue, and added</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that the directorate was &quot;effective&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Directorate representative Peter Mothle said it could not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">check whether &quot;people take us seriously&quot; but would be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;incensed&quot; if its recommendations had been ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are setting up regional structures to make sure that we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">can ensure compliance and we are also in constant contact with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the minister's office about the matter,&quot; Mothle said. Such</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">structures could take another year to be established, he</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">places her in a murky ethical area.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no doubt among the children's parents and the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">school's management council that the hostel is providing a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">much-needed service for children who would otherwise be forced</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to travel long distances on public transportation or taxis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law says any education employee with a second job must</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">declare it to the department and disclose any profits to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tax authorities. But the issue is such a new one that even</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng's MEC for education, Mary Metcalfe, is unclear about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the legality and says she would have to look into it, although</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">she praises Burger's efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here's somebody who's prepared to go out on a limb to make</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sure the children are okay,&quot; says Metcalfe. She says Burger</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has a well-established reputation for nonracial, quality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">education and &quot;I don't have any doubt she's doing it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">properly&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the grey area in which the hostel operates makes some</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in education circles uncomfortable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal or not, &quot;morally, it doesn't sound right&quot;, says Don</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pasqualli of the South African Democratic Teachers' Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's like the principal owning the tuck shop at the school.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the face of it, Burger, a self-described &quot;blonde</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afrikaans lady&quot;, who sports lots of jewellery and perfectly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">manicured long pink nails, doesn't appear to be enriching</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">herself. According to her figures, the hostel, operating at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">full capacity, could bring in about R160 000 a year. Profits</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would be slim after subtracting the costs of feeding, bathing,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and cleaning up after 35 children, plus paying the staff and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the bond and repairs on the 100-year-old two- storey house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parents are not balking at the fees, which run from R4 000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to R6 000 a year on top of school fees of R750. The hostel is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">full and has a waiting-list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hostel was originally conceived to deal with the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dangerous commute faced by children ferried from Soweto. Black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">children from the townships were treading new territory when</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the school opened in 1992, and taxis heading into white areas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">were being harassed. Children wore their &quot;civvies&quot; for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commute, only to change into their uniforms of bright purple</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">blazers and hats when they arrived safely at school. The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ritual was repeated in reverse for the homeward trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some taxis would not make the trip back and impromptu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">slumber parties were arranged at the homes of obliging</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">teachers for children stuck in the city for the night. &quot;All</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the children who stayed behind told all the other children</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">what a ball they had,&quot; says Burger, and suddenly &quot;missing&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">your taxi was a popular option. Plans for the hostel were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hatched and approved by the school's council - provided Burger</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">made the purchase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone agrees that Burger, named Gauteng's businesswoman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the year last October by the South African Council for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businesswomen for her work in training adults to set up their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">own businesses in Soweto, used her business acumen to achieve</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wonders on a shoestring budget with the &quot;shell&quot; of a school</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">she took over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Classrooms at the former Afrikaans school, which had been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">serving only about 60 white children, doubled as rubbish</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">heaps. But as Burger set to work, word of mouth about the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;purple school&quot; got around and Malvern Primary was inundated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with applicants. Today, enrolment is just shy of 900 in a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">school originally planned for 500. More than 80% of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">students come from outside the local area, with some making</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">more than 70km treks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the long trek begs a bigger question: &quot;Why should</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">parents want to send children so far? Why not send them just</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">down the block?&quot; asks Johan Potgieter, a law professor at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unisa with an interest in education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ask Reuben Nxumalo, a single father, who jumped at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opportunity to get his 11- year-old son Nkosana &quot;out of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">township life&quot; and into a &quot;quiet, good place to get his life</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in order&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His son has a regimented life in the hostel with set study</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and play times, Bible readings and bedtime at 8pm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I miss him so much, but it's for a good cause,&quot; says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nxumalo, a clerk with the Housing Department who works and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lives in Soweto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hostels such as Burger's will be seized on by people like</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nxumalo, &quot;ordinary parents who go to extraordinary lengths to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">get their children educated&quot;, in Potgieter's words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to be demanding the same high standards in schools</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">everywhere,&quot; says Metcalfe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, as Malvern Primary shows, the stream of children into</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">town will not be staunched until parents feel they can get a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">quality education in their own neighbourhoods.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Only about half of R65-million budgeted for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HIV education, prevention and care has yet been used - - even</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">while the virus continues to spread alarmingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The money, from the Reconstruction and Development</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Programme (RDP), is a major portion of funds made available to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fight HIV. Other finance comes from the European Union and the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health Department's budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Figures from the national and provincial offices of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">department's HIV directorate reveal the reality of what many</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">activists have long claimed: that while programmes and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">policies now on paper could reduce the spread of the epidemic,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the pace of implementation is agonisingly slow.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The R65-million was allocated by the RDP for HIV/Aids</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">programmes in the budget year that ended in March. Of this,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">R18-million earmarked for strengthening counselling, outreach</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and community-care services was promised to the provinces, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is still going through bureaucratic processes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the R4,4-million meant for research into care and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">support has been spent. Only half the R8-million for bringing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government departments into the fight has been used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rose Smart, head of the Aids directorate, said this week</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that she expected all the RDP funds to be spent and there was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">no danger of losing them. She added she was aware that her</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">directorate and many of the provinces were unable to push</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">through HIV programmes as quickly as she would like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're definitely making progress, but often things take</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">time,&quot; she said, emphasising the need to lay the institutional</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">groundwork before programmes can begin. &quot;These things can't be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rushed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as directorate officials struggle to strengthen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">existing programmes and bring new ones on line, Aids activists</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">say other departments and the public remain largely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">indifferent to the epidemic that figures released last week</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">show is expanding at a horrifying rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HIV infection among pregnant women increased 35% last year,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to reach 14%. Health officials believe the annual survey of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">women attending antenatal clinics is an accurate benchmark to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">study the spread of HIV-infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 2,4-million South Africans are now HIV-positive, up</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from 1,8 million last year, a one-year increase of 33%. Some 1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">500 South Africans become infected each day: 90 000 people are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">expected to develop full-blown Aids this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the figures came as no surprise to the experts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tracking the epidemic, one official described the numbers as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;mind- boggling&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest figures show that efforts to stem the tide in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa have simply not been effective, said Kevin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Osborne of the National Association of People Living with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HIV/Aids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously, not enough is being done,&quot; he said. &quot;They've</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">got the money to spend, the programmes are designed, and then</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">they get sent to the provinces and nothing happens.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sarafina II and Virodene &quot;debacles&quot; drained time and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">energy from efforts to implement HIV programmes, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delays had also been caused by the turnover in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">directorate's leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Directorate officials blame delays on late approval of last</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">year's RDP budget for anti-Aids programmes, &quot;time-consuming</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tendering processes&quot;, and restructuring of departments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials and activists repeatedly bring up the model of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda, which has shown that high-level political commitment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to combat the disease can bring down infection rates. That</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">level of commitment is not seen in South Africa, they say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phone calls to several organisations and departments that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">could play a key role in fighting the spread of the disease</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">indicate such a lack of commitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Union of Mineworkers, for example, does not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have an HIV-education programme in place for its members, nor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">any condom-distribution programme. NUM, described as a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">relatively progressive union on HIV issues, has no schedule to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">put any programmes in place, according to Welcome Mboniso, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">union's health and safety coordinator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Training for high school teachers in anti- HIV education is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">due to begin this month. They will then launch a nationwide</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">education programme for schoolchildren.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Welfare Department is only expected to begin evaluating</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">what it can do about the HIV epidemic this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation's prison system has been praised for improving</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">its HIV policies in the past year, but questions remain about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">relatively simple issues like how condoms should be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">distributed. Presently, prisoners must often ask officials for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a condom, a system which discourages their use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With HIV infection already so high in South Africa, some</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">activists say &quot;we missed the boat&quot; on prevention, and that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">resources should now be focused on providing the best possible</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">care. Although that view is a matter of hot debate, it is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">clear that, whatever is done, there will be no quick reversal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the epidemic.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Despite employing 125 000 public servants,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Northern Province wants to set aside R790-million this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">year to pay for consultants and &quot;special services&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The province's Premier, Ngoaka Ramathlodi, said this week</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that its army of public officials had been &quot;mostly trained to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">clerical level&quot; and that the consultants were vital to ensure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">its administration works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The province is burdened with public servants inherited</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from the former homeland administrations in Lebowa, Gazankulu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and Venda and the old Transvaal Provincial Administration, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">new, inexperienced officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The total salary bill budgeted for 1997/98 is more than R6-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">billion. The Northern Province legislature still has to debate</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the officials have been housed in Pietersburg</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hotels and government flats for the past three years - at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">taxpayers' expense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Northern Province has a population of five million, 90%</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of whom live in abject poverty. A public service job is highly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">prized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provisions in the interim Constitution, which still stand,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">make it impossible for the government to dismiss those they do</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first job you have to do is get your administration</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">going because that is how you create yourself and for us, this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">act of creation is far more difficult and complex than in any</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the other provinces,&quot; says Ramathlodi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are starting at the back of the queue and we are going</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to have to work doubly hard just to make up the difference</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">between ourselves and other provinces.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been growing concern about the national</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government's use of consultants: the fears were underlined by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Auditor General Henri Kluever in his annual report on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government finances released in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Northern Province plans suggest Kluever may have merely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">scratched the surface. Kluever said this week he knew nothing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">about the province's consultancy budget. The province's own</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">auditor refused to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consultancy budget includes R15-million for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramathlodi's office, while the provincial Health Department</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has been allocated R328-million to spend on external advisers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and special services. The Education Department has been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">assigned R246,8-million, the Welfare Department R90,7-million</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and the Agriculture Department R12,8-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finance MEC Edgar Mushwana says the departments do not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">necessarily spend every cent on consultants. &quot;Education, I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">know, spends some of that money on books,&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consultants are needed, he says, because the public</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">service is not up to the job. His own department has only just</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reconciled the accounts of the previous homelands'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">administrations - three years after officials began pawing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">through the books. External consultants had to be hired to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">complete the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, the public service's main achievements appear to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have been to over- run Pietersburg and push up property</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mushwana divides the 125 000 public servants into four</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">groups: the old guard, who complain about the government not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sticking to its own rules; former homeland public servants,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">who are unproductive; malcontents, who want to pull everybody</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">down with them; and &quot;comrades&quot;, who are inexperienced but who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">want to get things done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We have no shortage of people who are prepared to work</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramathlodi says the province also has to manage ethnic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">differences between Pedis, Tshongas, Vendas and Afrikaners</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">within the service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The province is unable to quantify the expense of housing</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, soaring property prices - the result of the</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The initial report by the Semenya</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commission into financial irregularities in the Northern</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Province recommends a purge of senior officials - many of them</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">close associates of Premier Ngoako Ramathlodi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior African National Congress members in the province</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">say the report - which Ramathlodi this week decided to keep</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">under wraps - &quot;is heavy on senior officials&quot; who may be fired</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as a result of the irregularities it exposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood that one senior official in the firing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">line is the province's principal accounting officer, Director</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General John Malatji. He was unavailable for comment at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">time of going to press.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several MECs also come in for criticism although it is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">thought unlikely that Ramathlodi - mindful of his support base</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- will fire them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission's findings include dubious property deals,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tender board irregularities and local landlords charging</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">inflated rents to provincial government tenants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also questions decisions taken by senior Public</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Works Department officials whose behaviour includes trying to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">allocate R95-million for a new government complex without</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">budgeting for the expenditure. The expenditure was blocked by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the legislature - a fact not immediately presented to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commission - but it also emerged that R40- million had already</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been paid to the prospective developer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramathlodi will discuss the report with President Nelson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela this weekend. The final version of advocate Ismail</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Semenya's findings is due to be submitted at the end of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The choice that Ramathlodi faces is grim. He must either</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">axe the guilty and so erode his own support base, or stick by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">them and stand to be identified with corruption and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">incompetence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Either way, Ramathlodi would play into the hands of his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opponents, who include ANC provincial chair George Mashamba;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC dissident Bantu Holomisa, who campaigned among public</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">servants in the province last week; and political parties such</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as the Azanian People's Organisation and the Pan Africanist</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Ramathlodi and Mashamba profess to having good</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">relations, political observers say the province's ANC is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">divided between the two and tensions between factions are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela has issued strict instructions that the ANC will</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not tolerate a repeat of the dissension which tore apart the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">organisation in the Free State last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramathlodi has been coy about the report which is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">understood to have been kept even from some of his MECs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a midweek briefing he justified his stand, saying:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are two sorts of interim reports: those that are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">published and those that are not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that evidence may still be put before the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commission which could alter its &quot;tentative&quot; findings. Semenya</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is currently abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramathlodi's representative said the premier had sought</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">legal advice on the meaning of the word &quot;interim&quot; to establish</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">whether or not he had to make it public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramathlodi's hesitation may be in part ascribed to his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">concerns about the province's deep and entwined political and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ethnic divisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has been accused of unfairly favouring the Pedis by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">appointing a Pedi-speaking director general, and subsequently</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of favouring Vendas in appointing senior public servants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramathlodi has said that such dynamics could lead to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">possible &quot;balkanisation of the province&quot; unless they were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tactfully managed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Semenya report will also have an impact on Ramathlodi's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">credibility as a &quot;clean&quot; leader in a poverty-stricken</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">province, where expectations of delivery are extremely high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 90% of the electorate voted for the ANC in 1994,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hoping for food, schools, clinics, water and houses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramathlodi has already come under pressure after he lost</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">his chairmanship of the provincial ANC to Mashamba last year -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">despite intervention by ANC headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mashamba believes Semenya's findings so far should be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">published.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(IBA) top officials face sacking chief executive officer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harris Gxaweni or defying the rest of their staff by keeping</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authority's staff representative committee, speaking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for 120 staff members, this week unanimously passed a vote of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">no confidence in Gxaweni, and demanded his suspension by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gxaweni is at the centre of the row stemming from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mismanagement and financial impropriety currently being probed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by the auditor general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The auditor general's interim findings expose massive holes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the IBA's financial administration and irregular spending</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by some of its councillors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff - whose initial complaints about mismanagement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">triggered the investigation - have also been outraged by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">decision, taken only last week, to give luxury cars to nine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">managers in a R2-million car allowance scheme. Gxaweni took</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">charge of his new Mercedes E320 last week, just before he went</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on leave to the Transkei.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a memorandum prepared following a meeting on Tuesday,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">staff demanded that &quot;Gxaweni be suspended by not later than</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday May 5&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff also echoed IBA councillor John Matisonn's call for a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">judicial commission of inquiry, which they believe should also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investigate whether Gxaweni is fit for the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff were due to make their no-confidence vote public this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under IBA legislation only the organisation's council can</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">axe Gxaweni, and only a full-blown parliamentary investigation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">can oust any of its councillors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the other IBA councillors have backed Matisonn's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">call for an inquiry. The IBA's co-chairman, Peter de Klerk -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">who backed Gxaweni's appointment last year - refuses to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">discuss the staff's decision before it comes before the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course we will have to deal with it in the course of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">time,&quot; he said. &quot;You don't have a press release or anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the staff's decision follows an informal vote of no</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">confidence in Gxaweni by the IBA council itself (which the IBA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has claimed never happened).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gxaweni was unavailable for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matisonn, who did not support Gxaweni's appointment,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">declined to comment this week beyond saying that &quot;there can be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">no cover- ups. If there are abuses they must be rooted out,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">but there is also an obvious problem about the financial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">management.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IBA's other co-chairman, Sebilitso Mokone-Matabane, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">councillor Lyndall Shope-Mafole, both of whom backed Gxaweni's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">appointment, are abroad until later this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The staff revolt sets a tantalising scene for the auditor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">general when he hands over his final report to Parliament next</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings could lead to a full-scale probe by the public</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">protector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the detail in the interim report concerning some</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">councillors' enthusiasm for using their taxpayer-funded credit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cards was made public last year by disgruntled staffers. The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday Times and the Electronic Mail &amp;Guardian published</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reports on the auditor general's interim findings. The Sunday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Times last week retracted allegations concerning Matisonn and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">former councillor William Lane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood that the final report is unlikely to name</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">individual wrongdoers, and will instead focus on weak</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">financial controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, further details of Gxaweni's colourful past</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seeped out this week. It is believed that Gxaweni has incurred</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">four bad debts since 1988, including R67 374 to the Transkei</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Building Society from 1988, and R2879 to his former employer,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Transkei Broadcasting Corporation, from 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Connie Molusi, the representative for the Communications</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister, Jay Naidoo, said the auditor general's final report</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was being awaited before a decision was taken whether to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recommend that President Nelson Mandela appoint a commission</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of inquiry. Molusi said it was too early to comment on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naidoo's plans to merge the IBA with the new government-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">controlled telecommunications regulator, the South African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Telecommunications Regulatorary Authority - a move which could</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">provide the opportunity for limiting the IBA's independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, more details of an elaborate plot apparently to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">discredit Lane emerged this week. The scam involved</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">transferring R811000 to an account in Lane's name at a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg branch of ABSA bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An IBA letterhead confirming Lane's credentials was sent to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the bank to open the account. It was under the forged</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">signature of De Klerk and was accompanied by a form dressed up</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as an IBA payslip and by a false ID book. On January 13 1997 a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cheque for R811 000 drawn from Investec Bank was deposited in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">favour of Lane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 17 the bank received an anonymous phone call to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">warn that a fraud was about to be committed in connection with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lane's account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lane was unavailable for comment this week. The IBA council</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">asked Gxaweni to undergo a polygraph test over the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He refused, before departing on leave.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">claims he was unfairly dismissed and that the church breached</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the new labour law when it failed to provide a reason for his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dismissal last June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claims he was axed because he tried to unite three</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anglican parishes in Humansdorp which are divided along racial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">grounds.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Bishop Eric Pike said he had revoked Paxton's licence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to practice &quot;because I found that he had ceased to properly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">administer the will of God to the people&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pike says it is his duty to revoke a licence if he decides</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that a priest is failing to carry out his God-given duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crux of the matter, Pike adds, is whether the labour</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">court has the right to alter a decision made in terms of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">church's strict guidelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is most certainly a very interesting test case and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will go a long way towards shaping the relationship between</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">churches and labour laws,&quot; Pike adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We follow very strict canons, or guidelines, and feel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">these should continue. We base our right to dismiss clergy on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the belief that they are appointed by God as his servants and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are thus not employees of the church in the strict sense of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the word.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paxton says it is time to challenge the sovereign right of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">any church to dismiss its employees by &quot;merely stating that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the wishes of God were not served . The time has passed for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">clergy not to be seen as normal employees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes the new Act, which came into effect last</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">November, safeguards his right to be given &quot;a proper</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">explanation and justification for my dismissal. I believe part</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the reason for my dismissal was due to the fact that I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tried to break down the racial barriers (in Humansdorp).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The parishes are strictly divided along racial lines, one</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for black, one for white and one for coloured people,&quot; Paxton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pike says he is astonished by the fact that Paxton would</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;drag race into the case. To my mind race has absolutely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nothing to do with this case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pike says he explained his reasoning to Paxton's parish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had been advised by the registrar of the Anglican church</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to say nothing more &quot;to avoid further letters from lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe I have performed my duty to God by this and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wouldn't like to elaborate on this in the media.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Two senior Home Affairs officials took a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">week-long break in Hong Kong, at the taxpayers' expense, to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">deport one Hong Kong citizen and allegedly enjoy the largesse</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of another, it emerged this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two Hong Kong citizens - John Yung and an elder man who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">declined to be named - flew to Hong Kong after being convicted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of perlemoen poaching. Both are back in South Africa - one</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">legally, one illegally.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both also allege that the two Home Affairs officials -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">former Western Cape regional director Koos van Wyngaardt and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">immigration official Herman Damas - spent much of their week</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the colony indulging in entertainments, their bill footed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by the senior Hong Kong citizen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian has an official Home Affairs removal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">warrant, dated February 1996, which shows that the elder man -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fined R90 000 for perlemoen poaching - should have been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">deported. However, the man returned to South Africa after the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">officials' outing, retained his permanent residence and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">currently operates a number of businesses across South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yung, fined R12 000 in the same court case, was left in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hong Kong, but has since returned to South Africa and is in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Wyngaardt, who has since quit the public service to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">establish an immigration consultancy, was unavailable for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">comment this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Damas denied the claims concerning their alleged</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">entertainment but confirmed that the elder man taken to Hong</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kong had come along &quot;just for the ride&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that he and Van Wyngaardt had been forced to stay</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Hong Kong because at the time South African Airways had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">only one flight a week. They had also spent the whole time in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a hotel - a Holiday Inn - living off their department</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">allowances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A regional department spokesman, Jurie de Wet, said it was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">practice for deportees to be accompanied, in case they &quot;tore</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">up their papers&quot; en route to their native countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But De Wet could not explain why two officials were needed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to accompany Yung, nor why the regional director was selected</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to go, nor why the elder Hong Kong citizen was invited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yung's legal representative said he would go to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of Home Affairs, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and take the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">matter to court. Yung had been denied the chance to appeal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">before he was forced on to the flight. &quot;He has nothing in Hong</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kong to go back to. For him deportation is worse than prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not a judge who took the decision. It was an official,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the lawyer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yung is involved in two restaurant businesses; he has been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a permanent resident in South Africa for five years; he lives</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">here with his wife and he has been removed from everything</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that matters to him at the discretion of an official because</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he pleaded guilty to a charge, which is under dispute.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - As South Africa frantically sweated to put</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the final touches to Zairean peace talks this week, serious</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">doubts began to emerge about the character of the man who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">holds all the cards - Laurent Kabila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila approaches the talks, expected on Saturday, amid</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations claims that the man vying to be president of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's third- largest nation is presiding over massacres and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has organised a &quot;slow extermination&quot; of hundreds of thousands</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of Rwandan refugees near the city of Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A furious Kabila has demanded an apology from UN secretary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">general Kofi Annan; none has been forthcoming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until last week, the United States - which supported</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mobutu Sese Seko's rise to power and backed him</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">through most of his 32-year rule - had declined to criticise</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila. Washington remained in regular contact with the rebel</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">leader during his six-month campaign to conquer Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US businessmen have met Kabila to discuss concessions for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cobalt and copper mining, among other mineral rights now</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">controlled by his Alliance of Democratic Forces for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberation of Congo/Zaire (AFDL).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with the refugee crisis growing, Washington sent its UN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ambassador, Bill Richardson, to Zaire to talk to Kabila about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">growing US concerns over his Alliance's behaviour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Zaire, however, Kabila represents change - one that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">people so desperately seek that they are prepared to overlook</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">his spasmodic record of resistance in his 20 years in exile</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and his failure to detail how he will deliver on his promises</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of democracy and a thriving economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since emerging from obscurity six months ago to lead a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rebellion that has already seized two-thirds of the vast</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">country, Kabila has proven himself an adept populist - a man</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">who gets roars of approval from massive crowds when he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">promises to halve the prices of fabric, electricity, water and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">beer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But journalists in Zaire have found it near-impossible to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dig beneath Kabila's veneer. He has fobbed off numerous</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">attempts to interview him on his past, his family and more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">importantly, his politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila (58), was born in southern Zaire on a branch of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congo River in Shaba province. He studied political philosophy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at a French university and returned to Zaire to enter politics</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shortly after his country gained independence from Belgium in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1960.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He became a member of the North Katanga Assembly,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">supporting Zaire's first prime minister, Patrice Lumumba. When</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lumumba was killed in 1961 in a coup engineered by Mobutu,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila fled and began plotting insurrection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was in charge of the rebellion in the Ruzizi lowlands,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the same place from which he launched his current campaign</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">against Mobutu. It was here that he met Che Guevara, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bolivian revolutionary, who came to offer his assistance in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1965.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guevara described Kabila as a &quot;good speaker&quot; and wrote to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fidel Castro confirming there was &quot;organised rebel activity&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the area. However, when Kabila's liberation council was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">defeated by government troops, Guevara left, disillusioned</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with Africa and Kabila, to pursue his revolution in South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years later Kabila founded a new rebel group, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People's Revolutionary Party, and began operating near Lake</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanganyika. In the 1970s, the group set up a &quot;liberated&quot; zone</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the Fizi mountains in the Kivu Province of Zaire, with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">collective farms, schools and clinics. They held out against</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">attacks by government forces for nearly two decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu's troops forced Kabila into exile in 1977. He fled</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to Tanzania and continued to mount guerrilla attacks into</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire for the following 10 years. During his exile, Kabila</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">travelled extensively in East Africa, forging strong ties with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yoweri Museveni, who seized power in Uganda in 1985. He was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">also closely allied with Paul Kagane, who led the Tutsi rebel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">army which took power in Rwanda in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After 1988, Kabila dropped from public view, prompting some</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to declare he was dead. But he emerged in October last year at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the head of the current rebellion, which was sparked by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zairean Tutsi anger at a government plan to strip them of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila has been vague when pressed to answer how his rebels</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">plan to rebuild Zaire. His supporters defend this by saying he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has delegated authority to his well- educated exile group who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have become part of his civilian cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His aides say he sets broad policy guidelines and leaves</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">them to sort out the details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is just this policy of delegation, observers say,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which may have led to death by starvation for thousands of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">refugees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - Two Zambian journalists jointly charged with &quot;Publishing false news with intent to cause fear and alarm to the public&quot; appeared for trial on April 28, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor Lweendo Hamusankwa and reporter Boyd Phiri for a privately-owned newspaper, The Chronicle, were charged under Section 67 of the Penal Code for publishing an article in the February 11 - 13 edition alleging that arms and ammunition had been stolen from a barracks in Lusaka. Hamusankwa also faces a &quot;Criminal libel&quot; charge for publishing an article in February 14 - 17 edition alleging that a presidential aide Everisto Mutale was using a stolen car. He was charged under Section 69 of the Penal Code. The case has been adjourned for mention to May 28; trial begins June 12</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the state has recruited a cabinet minister in the Office of the President, Eric Silwamba, to assist in the prosecution of the two journalists.  However, Hamusankwa told MISA May 7, the inclusion of Silwamba is clear testimony that the state wants to get a conviction. &quot;Their ultimate goal is to get a conviction and make an example of us. They lost the Jambwa case and they don't want to lose another one,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BACKGROUND Hamusankwa was on February 16 arrested and detained for publishing in the paper two offending articles in February 11 - 13 and 14 - 17 editions of The Chronicle. He was on February 17 charged with &quot;Publication of false news with intent to cause fear and alarm to the public&quot; contrary to Section 67 of the Penal Code. On February 18, he was released on a bail of ZK500,000 (about US$383) after spending two days in prison. Hamusankwa, however, denied both charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Boyd Phiri was arrested February 17 and jointly charged with his editor Hamusankwa in connection with the article appearing in the February 11 - 13 edition. He was, together with a colleague, George Jambwa, summoned (on February 17) to police headquarters for questioning. Jambwa was released without charge. Phiri was later taken into custody until his court appearance on February 18, when he was also released on paid bail.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Misa commended journalists from Angola, Swaziland and Zambia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for continuing to report events in their countries without fear, despite</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the hostility of their governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Notwithstanding this discouraging scenario, journalists in all Sadc</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">countries continue to show courage in the face of adversity and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">independent media tenaciously send their messages to the public,&quot; Misa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking Saturday at the commemoration of the World Press Freedom</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Day, Zambian journalists reiterated their demand for the withdrawal of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the proposed Media Council Bill table in parliament by government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media Liaison Committee Chariman Robby Makayi said that journalists</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">had rejected the establishment of the council which intended to regulate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">journalists and &quot;criminalise&quot; the profession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have totally rejected the media council. it is not reasonally</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">justified in a democractic society,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April, government suspended its decision to table the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">controversial media council draft bill in parliament after a heated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">debate in the country by journalists who opposed the bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government said it had withdrawn the bill to allow for further</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">consultations and provide an opportunity for debate and exchange of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">views with stakeholders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill seeks to ensure the compulsory registration of journalists,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to set minimum qualifications for them and institute a legal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">disciplinary body for media practitioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It belongs to the era of thought control in dictatorial regimes,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makayi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia Information Minister David Mpamba said Friday on television,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in a programme to mark World Press Freedom Day, that it was unfortunate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that journalists had rejected the media council without looking at its</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;merits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the bill was basically drawn by government to help</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">journalists come together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World Press Freedom Day, which is observed May 3, is an occation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">declared by the United Nations to give international recognition to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">important contribution the media makes to their societies and the</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - Efforts to build an Africa information</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">superhighway get closer to reality Monday when ministers responsible for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">economic and social development, and planning meet for four days</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">beginning Monday to review a report on the implementation of the African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information Society Initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa said Saturday, from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">its Addis Ababa headquarters, that attention will be given to the role</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of information and communications technologies in promoting trade and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another meeting organized by the commission in 1996 decided that, in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the least, each African country needed to be connected to the internet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">over two years as a mark of progress in linking Africa to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">superhighway.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report contains a policy awareness project on the dissemination</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the Information Society's Initiative framework in Africa and beyond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With government officials, international and regional organizations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">interested in information technology as its target groups, the project</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is widely distributed in its original and packaged forms for different</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">audiences in major languages of the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A video programme entitled Building Internet to Ethiopia was produced</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by the U.N. commission and the World Bank. This was part of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commission's series on Building Africa's Information Highway -- a focus</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on success stories using information and communication technology from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egypt, Mozambique, Senegal and South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, ministers will also note that the commission has developed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a Web site on the Africa Information Society Initiative currently housed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at Bellanet, in Ottawa, Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The society's report states that democratization of access to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">information is one of the focus areas it advocates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Moving access from relatively wealthy urban centres to disadvantaged</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">communities is the target,&quot; the commission said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An major effort is being formulated to support the Information</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Society. It evolves around an appropriate approach to language and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">literacy development content, the development or conversion of content</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">into usable electronic forms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others are the definition of learning, evaluation and impact</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">assessment mechanisms through which best practices could be fed into</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">future projects; and the impact of new technologies on gender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A major symposium will take place May 7, involving senior industry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">chiefs. This is organized by the commission together with the Global</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information Infrastructure Commission. It is scheduled to be broadcast</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">live by satellite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Information Society Initiative originated from the African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Symposium on Telematics for Development organized by the commission in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1995. This was done in cooperation with the International</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Telecommunications Union, the United Nations Education, Science and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cultural Organization, working through the African Networking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, the initiative has been endorsed by the Organization of</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">minister, Damase Ntiranyibagira, on Friday in Harare, refuted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">allegations that his country is aiding Zairean rebels led by Laurent</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ntiranyibagira told journalists after paying a courtesy call on</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are unfounded allegations. Burundi has its own enormous</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Text of comments on Zaire by State Department spokesman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Dinger at the May 2 briefing:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Could you bring us up to date on Zaire?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: Well, as we all know, a meeting between President Mobutu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and rebel alliance leader Kabila is scheduled for today, May 2nd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mobutu has left Kinshasa for Point Noire, Congo, and I do</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">believe he is aboard a South African ship at this time. Alliance leader</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila arrived in Luanda this morning from Lubumbashi. The last I have</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seen, Mr. Kabila remains in Luanda. Since the meeting has not yet begun</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and since at least Mr. Kabila's travel would involve a relatively</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lengthy helicopter flight to the ship, I think we have to be frank and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">realize that it is very much in question whether the meeting is going to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">take place today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would note that the South Africans, we believe, are still confident</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that the meeting will take place soon, if not today, we would certainly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hope tomorrow. President Mandela, of course, is hosting the conference</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on board a South African ship. We expect it to be in international</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">waters off the coast of Zaire. Ambassador Richardson and South African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mandela are currently in Point Noire. President Mandela and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congolese President Lisuba have asked Ambassador Richardson to attend</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the shipboard talks. As we said yesterday, Ambassador Richardson is most</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">happy to fulfill whatever role President Mandela, the UN special</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">representative Sahnoun and others believe will be useful. He does plan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to remain and, hopefully, participate in the meeting which will take</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">place possibly today, but it now seems more likely tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would just point out that these are very, very important talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These talks are very important for President Mobutu, very important for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">alliance leader Kabila but, most importantly, very important for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">people of Zaire. We believe it is essential that these talks take place</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and we urge the leaders to make that happen. At the same time, we also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">need to stress that a Mobutu-Kabila meeting, while an important step,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">does not mean that all of the very difficult issues remaining before</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">them will be resolved. Nevertheless, we do urge the leaders to make sure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this meeting takes place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: John, how complicating has been the French Government's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">efforts to keep Mobutu in power?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: The reports that perhaps we all saw this morning in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">press clearly involved alleged intelligence reports and, for that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reason, I am not going to discuss reports of French involvement in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">supporting President Mobutu. What I would like to say though is that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France and the United States have worked very, very closely throughout</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this crisis. You will remember before the conference in Loma we jointly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">demarched, I think it was, some 20 or 30 African capitals. We believe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that the United States and France share the same objectives. Those</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">include obtaining a cessation of hostilities, seeing a negotiated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">transition to a democratic government, responding to the urgent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">humanitarian needs of refugees in eastern Zaire, and facilitating the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">repatriation of Rwandan refugees. So while I can't comment on these</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">intelligence reports of French covert support for President Mobutu, I</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would like to stress how closely the United States and France have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">worked towards the same goals in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: I didn't mention the word &quot;intelligence&quot; at all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">deliberately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: The press reports have, though.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: But I didn't refer to them at all. I just asked you whether</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">French efforts to support Mobutu have complicated your efforts to try to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">get some sort of a peaceful transition here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: We worked very, very closely with the French towards the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">same goals in the same efforts, and those include finding a cease-fire,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">achieving a cease-fire, pursuing a negotiated transition, responding to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the humanitarian need. So I guess in that way I am indirectly responding</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to your question, I think.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: You're saying that - well, let me try to break it down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: I'm saying that we're working together closely. So should</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">you ask in what way has it inhibited us, I would say very much the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">contrary; the United States and France have worked cooperatively on this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">issue for some months, particularly in this immediate crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Does the United States though feel that France was trying</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to beef up Mobutu as he was weakening in power and the rebels were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">advancing?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: I don't have any reason to confirm that sort of attitude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I say, very much the opposite, that France and the United States very</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">much share policy in the goals in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Have you seen the reports that Angolan armored units have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">become involved in the fight?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: We have seen the reports of Angolan involvement. I can't</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">confirm any of the specifics about Angolan involvement. I certainly saw</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the reports today about bridging equipment and armored carriers, etc. It</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is quite clear though that the Angolans have been providing support to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the alliance. We have very strongly urged the Angolans, privately and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">publicly, at the very highest levels that they should end their military</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">involvement and that they should support international efforts to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">achieve a negotiated end to the conflict in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having said that, we also have to allow that we continue to see these</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reports of continued Angolan involvement. Ambassador Richardson was just</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Luanda and one of his principal purposes was to discuss Angola's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">involvement in Zaire and to underscore in the strongest terms that we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">believe it is clearly in Angola's interest not to become involved in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire because that involvement is only likely to contribute to unrest in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire, which borders on Angola. That simply can not be in the interest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of Angola to contribute to instability in Zaire. So Ambassador</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richardson just yesterday was in Luanda making these points very</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">strongly. This is not the first occasion that we have had to make our</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">position known to Angolans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Well, does this suggest to you that the spillover of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">war has already begun to occur in the neighboring countries?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: There have been allegations since the current, shall we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">say, crisis some six or eight months ago that there have been various</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">outside forces from many of the neighboring countries involved in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">conflict in Zaire. We have, from the very beginning, said in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">strongest terms that we don't believe there is any useful role for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">foreign forces to play in Zaire. We have said that publicly and we have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been in touch with all those countries which are alleged to be involved</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">urging them to stay out of this conflict because it can have no positive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">impact on the situation in Zaire, very much the opposite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Is it clear that this could lead ultimately to the breakup</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the territorial integrity of the country which is now known as Zaire?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: It is very difficult to say with any confidence what the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">impact could be. Clearly, it threatens to create more instability in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire; therefore, we don't believe any foreign country or forces have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">any useful role to play. We believe this is a conflict that must be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">limited to the people of Zaire and must be resolved by them. In that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">context, we are working very, very vigorously -- particularly the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President and the Secretary have just sent Ambassador Richardson to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire -- in a very strong effort to reach a cease-fire and to lay out,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">develop, a plan that will eventually lead to a stable and democratic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire. The involvement of foreign forces in Zaire can not contribute to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that goal, very much the opposite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: (Inaudible) on the list of those countries which you have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seen reported to be involved?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: Well, I will let you review the reports of which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">countries are reported to be involved. I will say that we have been in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">touch with all of them and on more than one occasion to stress our</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">point. The bottom line here is that it is not in their interest to be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">involved in this; what is in their interest is for there to be a stable,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">democratic and, frankly, prosperous Zaire. Now, that goal is some ways</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">away. But that is the goal and, in order to achieve that goal, what we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">need is for President Mobutu and alliance leader Kabila to meet, for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">there to be a cease-fire, and that there be a transition to an inclusive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">democratic process and government in Zaire. That is what we all need to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">be working on and that is where people should be concentrating their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: John, there have been reports of UNITA involvement on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">behalf of Mobutu. Did Richardson meet with Jonas Savimbi and did this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">issue come up?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: I don't believe that Ambassador Richardson met on this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">occasion with Mr. Savimbi. I can tell you, however, that we have been in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">touch with all the parties in Angola who may be involved in Zaire and we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have made this point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: John, is there evidence based on Kabila's contacts with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American officials that he has a good understanding of what a transition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to democracy would mean and that he is prepared to carry it out?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: Well, of course, our contact with Mr. Kabila has been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">conducted on various levels. We have an officer from our embassy in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kinshasa who is now in eastern Zaire. I am not positive he has met</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">directly with Mr. Kabila, but Mr. Bogosian has been in contact with Mr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila and, of course, we have a very persuasive special envoy at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">present time there who has just met with Mr. Kabila. Ambassador</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richardson is very persuasive. He has certainly, in the strongest terms,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">expressed our policy and our point of view to Mr. Kabila. We certainly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hope that Mr. Kabila will understand that this is in the interest of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">everybody involved but, most especially, the interest and the people of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: What kind of response did he get from Kabila? Did he get</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">any assent?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: I don't think I will be able to offer you any replies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from Mr. Kabila, but I just leave it that we have made it very clear and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that Ambassador Richardson is a very persuasive person and that I am</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">certain that he made these points in a most convincing way. We are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">certainly hopeful that Mr. Kabila recognizes this and, no matter what</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">happens in Zaire, that he will be a force for democracy and stability</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Is it fair to say that his commitment to democracy still is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">an open question?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: The fact that he is not someone that we have had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">extensive contact with over many years. It is certainly obvious that we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">can not say with any certainty what his ultimate goals might be. Of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">course, we don't want to speculate on what his ultimate achievements</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">might be. I think what we would say is that, regardless of what happens</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Zaire, we would hope that Mr. Kabila is a positive force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: John, is there some doubt that the two men will meet or do</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">you just attribute the fact that the meeting hasn't happened today to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">some of the logistics that have been involved?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: It is very difficult to know with precision what has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">caused the meeting not to take place today. I think we have probably all</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">seen the reports, whether they be on television or on the wires, about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the problems that have arisen. Clearly, there are issues involving the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">health of President Mobutu. There are issues about long helicopter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rides. There are all these issues. Logistics are a problem, but is very</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">difficult to understand exactly what happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We certainly hope that both leaders will make every effort to make</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this meeting take place. We really think it is in their interest. I'll</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">just repeat once again, it is in the interest of Zaire, the country and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">its people, that they meet and that they: one, achieve a cease-fire, a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cessation of hostilities; and that they, two, develop a reasonable plan,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a workable plan, that will lead to a transition towards democracy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In response to a number of media queries regarding the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business Day story on the possible applications for amnesty by members</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - ECA will be taking its leadership role in building an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African information superhighway one step further when African Ministers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">responsible for economic and social development and planning meet at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">headquarters of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) on 5-8 May</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministers and African experts will consider a report on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">implementation of the African Information Society Initiative (AISI).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Key attention will be given to the role information and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">communications technologies in promoting trade and investment. A major</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">symposium -- organised by ECA together with the Global Information</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Infrastructure Commission and scheduled to be broadcast live by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">satellite on Multichoice DSTV by MNET -- will take place on 7 May,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">involving senior industry chiefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AISI has its origins in the African Symposium on Telematics for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Development organised by the ECA in 1995, in cooperation with the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the United Nations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Education, Science and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International Development Resource Centre (IDRC) working through the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African Networking Initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report notes that since then AISI was endorsed by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organisation of African Unity, African Ministers of Telecommunications</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and some 29 partner organisations involved in African development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another meeting organized by the ECA in 1996 decided that some</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">benchmarks, articulated around a minimum prerequisite consisting of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">availability of internet connectivity in each African country, were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">needed to mark progress over the following two years, according to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It contains a policy awareness project on the dissemination of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AISI framework in Africa and beyond. With government officials,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">international and regional organisations interested in information</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">technology as its target groups, the project is widely distributed in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">its original and packaged forms for different audiences in major</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">languages of the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report points out that ECA worked with the World Bank to produce</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a video programme entitled &quot;Building Internet to Ethiopia&quot; as part of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">its series on &quot;Building Africa's Information Highway&quot; -- a focus on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">success stories using information and communication technology from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egypt, Mozambique, Senegal and South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministers will also note that ECA has developed an AISI Web site</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">currently housed at Bellanet, in Ottawa, Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report makes it clear that the democratization of access to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">information is one of the focus areas advocated by AISI. Moving access</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from relatively wealthy urban centres to disadvantaged communities is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A major activity here, the report continues, is the Acacia Initiative</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">being formulated by IDRC in support of AISI. It evolves around the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- An appropriate approach to language/literacy content development,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and the development or conversion of content into usable electronic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">forms;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Definition of learning, evaluation and impact assessment mechanisms</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">through which best practices could be fed into future projects;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Impact of new technologies on gender.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - The Zambia Independent Media Association (ZIMA/MISA-Zambia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reports that Health Minister Katele Kalumba has ordered the Central</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Board of Health (CBOH), to stop advertising in the privately-owned</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">newspaper, The Post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZIMA says the paper reported in its April 22 edition quoting a CBOH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">source as saying: &quot;We have given the paper a lot of business but we have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been directed (by the minister) to stop it and place adverts with the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(government-owned) Times of Zambia or Daily Mail&quot;. No reason has been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">given for the order but ZIMA believes the paper's criticism of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government may have been the cause.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CBOH spokesman Dr. Ben Chirwa has, however, denied the allegation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chirwa told ZIMA on May 2, &quot;there was never such a directive from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalumba, neither was the issue ever discussed by the CBOH board... If we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">want to advertise we look at our financial position and based on that,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">we advertise in either all the papers or a selected paper(s).&quot; Chirwa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">further said CBOH dictates decisions and not the ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZIMA chairperson David Simpson, in a letter dated April 23, to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalumba, protested the minister's reported order prohibiting the CBOH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from advertising in The Post. Simpson pointed out in the letter that the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">role of an independent newspaper was not to &quot;respect&quot; the government,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">but observe and report events at home and abroad. &quot;It would be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hypocritical of the media to maintain an adulatory stance if they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">observe the principles of good governance being sometimes deliberately</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">neglected,&quot; he said. Simpson added in the letter that the Ministry of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information had assured ZIMA there was no &quot;deliberate policy&quot; by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government to ban advertising in the private media, only commercial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">considerations were used in such decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT) president, Alfred</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zulu, said April 21, the decision prohibiting the CBOH adverts in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Post would be counter-productive because of the paper's popularity. Said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zulu: &quot;It's at the peril of those who don't advertise because the paper</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">commands a respectable and wide readership.&quot; But Zulu added saying the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">order was &quot;draconian, unacceptable and attempted blackmail.&quot; ends</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KASANE, Botswana (PANA) - President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">implored Monday countries in southern Africa to remove impediments to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wider and more trade, in order to forge sounder economic partnerships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe, who was chairing the Southern Africa International Dialogue</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">session which discussed the development of Southern Africa as a growth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">area, cited tariffs as one such impediment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the year 2004, for instance, we must have lowered tariffs to zero</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">percent,&quot; he told nine Southern African leaders, and some 140 captains</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of industry from the region and abroad.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders and business executives are seeking to forge economic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ties, in an arrangement dubbed Smart Partnerships. The conference, which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">started Sunday, ends Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can grow without developing,&quot; Mugabe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that governments in the region had inherited economies from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">colonialists which were at different stages of growth, with the economic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">giant being South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said, while South Africa was relatively developed, there</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was no matching human development pertaining to improving the standard</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of living of its people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe also called on governments to improve the lives of its rural</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">folk, encourage them to grow cash crops and establish marketing boards</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which would help sell these foods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, he said, was much more beneficial than &quot;just growing large</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">volumes of crops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the session, Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the economies of Southern African countries had improved lately. For</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">example, each had reduced inflation by an average 5 percent per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said in the past four years, about 380 projects valued at a total</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of 8.1 billion U.S. dollars had been approved in the various economic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sectors in the 12-nation Southern Africa Development Community</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governments in the subregion undertook considerable market reforms</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and liberalized their economies,&quot; Chissano said. &quot;They work from the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">conviction that we need to pool resources together in order to develop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We cannot develop separately.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday, beginning a six-nation Africa tour to consolidate relations with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">its remaining friends on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The visit comes amidst a continuing diplomatic offensive by Taiwan</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Li said on arrival in Lusaka that China, with one of the fastest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">growing economies in the world, attached great importance to African</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">safeguarding world peace and in ensuring development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that China's relations with Africa had survived considerable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">political shifts in direction within African and the remaining world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 12 cash-strapped African countries have, in just over a year,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">courted and granted Taiwan diplomatic recognition. They have received</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">considerable money from a Taiwan flushed with cash. So, Beijing has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">accused Taipei of exploiting Africa's poverty to buy recognition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Li expressed hope that his visit to Africa would help</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">consolidate the relations for the mutual benefit of the peoples of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa and China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Africa nations recognizing Taiwan have been mostly economically</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">weak and without significant continental political clout. Beijing has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">managed to maintain ties with the more important states such as Nigeria</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Li, who is on a three-day official visit to Zambia, was at signing</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairing a session at the on-going Southern African International</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, if these examples of victory of the African human spirit</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa was, for the first time, now poised to reap the full benefits</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COTONOU, Benin (PANA) - Benin's National Oil Products Marketing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Company (SONACOP) has increased the price of various petroleum products</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by between three percent and 30 percent. Announcing the price hikes on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday, SONACOP said Kerosine, widely used here for cooking lighting,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would now sell at 125 CFA francs per litre from 100 CFA previously (500</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CFA = 1USD).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The price of high grade petrol went up by 25 CFA to 200 CFA per litre</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">while the price of ordinary petrol rose slightly from 170 to 175 CFA. A</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">litre of diesel increased by more than 30 percent to 175 CFA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increases did not come as a surprise for consumers who have been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">expecting them since the sector was liberalised last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, authorized dealers of smuggled petrol from neighbouring</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria known here as &quot;Kpayo&quot; continued to sell at 150 CFA per litre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour unions have criticised the hikes which followed similar rises</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the cost of electricity, water and cement, saying they have fuelled</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">inflation and pushed up cost of living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workers listed these among problems they presented to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government on May Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued on Friday, SONACOP said the new prices were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">simply adjustments to higher prices for petrol imports mainly caused by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the appreciation of the U.S. dollar which is the reference currency in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the oil market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the company, the price of petroleum products had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">remained unchanged in Benin since 1988, and in spite of the devaluation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the CFA in 1994 which doubled the local prices of most imported</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief provincial traffic inspector Francois Coombs, who initially</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he arrived on Monday, however, he discovered that the R1,2-</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">missing from the Centre's fire-proof safe was an attache brief case with</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A police investigation was unable to trace the arson culprits but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">confirmed that the Centre had been purposely burnt down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite handing over &quot;iron clad&quot; evidence and video-tapes of license</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">corruption by the four officials to provincial traffic director Henry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazer, one of the officials was made an assistant director shortly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">afterwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official, who was not named, was still being investigated and was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on suspension at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All four officials, two traffic officers and two administrative</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">officials, also allegedly refused to return the State money they had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">accepted as bribes, while a driving school which was allegedly in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cahoots with the officials and which was paid R700 by undercover</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investigators, threatened to &quot;cause trouble&quot; for investigators with the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">provincial Safety &amp; Security MEC, Steve Mabona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Brazer and Mabona featured prominently in testimony before the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission last week, when a number of traffic officials accused them of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">irregularly organising and issuing both a learner's and driver's license</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to Parliamentary deputy speaker Baleka Mbete-Kgositsile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Mbete-Kgositsile has no personal or constituency links to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpumalanga, she received both licenses on the same day, on October 1,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">last year after Mabona sent his own car and bodyguards to fetch her from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg.  Brazer, who was booked off work at the time after a minor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">heart attack, drove 350km from Nelspruit to Delmas to personally test</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbete-Kgositsile - despite not being registered as a certified testing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No official records of either the test or the licenses were kept and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">documentation which was later produced to 'prove' that there had not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been any irregularities instead contained numerous errors or procedural</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">irregularities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coombs also told the Commission on Monday that he had originally been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">asked to investigate corruption charges against Brazer after he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">allegedly bought a boat and diving equipment for personal use with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">departmental money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just before launching the investigation, Coombs was told that it had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been taken over by senior traffic inspector Roelf Smith - who currently</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">shares the same attorney as Brazer during Commission testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was then asked to investigate the issuing of up to 300 licenses a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">day in Kabokweni but Brazer first forced us to tell him the names of our</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">undercover officers and decoys,&quot; said Coombs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We staked the place out for two days and then sent our decoys in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The moment they asked for licenses and showed their ID books, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">officers chased them away - saying that they had been warned we were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAPS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coombs added that when he complained about the handling of both the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KwaMhlanga and Kabokweni cases, he was threatened with transfer away</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from his home in Middelburg and disciplinary action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was also suspended without explanation from all investigative</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">duties in April 1996 and allegedly intimidated by senior departmental</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">officials. Brazer has allegedly ignored Coombs repeated requests to meet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with him to discuss the threats and intimidation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazer is expected to testify before the Commission on Wednesday,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">while the traffic official, John Muller, who first revealed that Mbete-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kgositsile had irregularly been issued licenses will testify on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MEC Mabona will be the last witness to testify some time next week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dynamite to blow up the mutilated body of ANC activist Sweet Johannes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sambo, so as to prevent his death from becoming &quot;another Steve Biko</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">affair&quot;, appeared briefly before the Middleburg Regional Court on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to earlier testimony from notorious Vlakplaas commander,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colonel Eugene de Kock, two unnamed black policemen arrested Sambo in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tonga, Near Komatipoort and interrogated him for gun-running in July,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he denied any knowledge of the charges, three of De Kock's men,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter McIntyre (31), Jacques Else (27) and Andries Venter (33) joined</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the interrogation. They stripped him naked, stuffed a tyre's inner tube</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">over his head before kicking, beating, clubbing and jumping on him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Sambo died of his wounds, the policemen allegedly phoned De Kock</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for advise on disposing of his body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Kock claims to have told the men to take Sambo to an abandoned</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mine near Thabazimbi and to use dynamite to destroy the corpse by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">repeatedly blowing it up. The mangled remains, described as &quot;persistent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">remains&quot; were then thrown down the mine shaft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecutor Marike de Kock told African Eye News Service (South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa) after the hearing on Monday that McIntyre, Venter, Else and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phillipus de Beer (39) had pleaded autrefois acquit because the State</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">had previously failed to provide sufficient evidence linking them to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">murder and the courts had been forced to acquit them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added that the State had decided to re-charge the men with murder</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">instead of assault charges after De Kock's confession and after he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">identified the men by name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Kock is currently serving 122 years in jail for a series of</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - On Monday April 21, a &quot;peace&quot; agreement was signed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">between the government of Sudan and four rebel factions, including those</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of Riek Machar and Kerubino Kwanyin Bol. Former President Jimmy Carter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was in Khartoum on the week-end for talks with President Bashir and the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">faction leaders.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not witness the signing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document deals with such issues as a referendum for the south</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">after a transition period of four years, Sharia law and where it can be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lifted, and sharing of power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SPLA has called the document a sham. It maintains the only</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">purpose of it is to absorb the factions into the Sudanese army whose</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">morale is very low. The fact that faction troops have been sent to Juba,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and the fact that the day after the signing of the deal, the government</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bombed Yei, the town where Garang was to meet Carter, does raise serious</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">doubts as to the actual purpose of the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some analysts say the peace deal does not amount to much without the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SPLA. They believe it is another manifestation of the government's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tactic, &quot;divide and rule&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some also fear that there will be more fighting now between the</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Before the conflict in Zaire erupted, the country people</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">were most concerned about in Africa was Burundi. Reports from that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">country indicate the situation is still very serious; there is an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">undeclared war going on there and massacres remain common in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">countryside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Buyoya took over in a military coup in July, allegedly to stop</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the &quot;bloody anarchy&quot;, the opposition claims as many as 50,000 have been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">killed. During the first week of April alone, 140 died in clashes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">between government troops and rebels in the south..(150,000 were killed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Burundi during the period from October 1993 when Melchior Ndadaye,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the democratically elected president, was assassinated, to July 1996</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">when Buyoya seized power.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent explosions in Bujumbura, the capital, have added a new</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dimension to the crisis. At least ten people have been killed and more</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wounded. There are doubts now that Buyoya can even guarantee the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">security of the capital which has been virtually ethnically cleansed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No group has claimed responsibility for the blasts. A Hutu protestant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">priest has been arrested. The blasts appeared to be targeted at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">areas of the well-to-do and the expatriates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regroupment Camps</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, the government of Burundi (more precisely, the regime of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buyoya) began rounding up civilians in the rural areas and placing them</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in camps, supposedly for their protection. According to human rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">groups, however, the camps are little more than government-run</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">concentration camps designed to control the mainly Hutu farmers in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">countryside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Ambassador has strongly attacked the regroupment camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a visit to the camps, inhabitants told him how they were forced</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">into the camps by the army and their homes destroyed. They fear both the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">army and the insurgents. Malnutrition and disease were reported</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">spreading in the camps; housing and sanitation are completely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">inadequate. Vital subsistence agriculture has been disrupted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly the people are there against their will. This violates the UN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Ambassador fears that with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the new fighting in the south, regroupment will spread there. It already</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">affects five provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meetings in Tanzania</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Easing of Sanctions Pressured from a number of sources, including the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN Secretary General, the African countries of the region agreed to a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">summit meeting to discuss easing the Burundi sanctions. The sanctions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">were imposed last August by these countries to express their disapproval</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of Buyoya's take-over. To lift the sanctions three conditions were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">required: 1) restoration of political parties, 2) reconvening of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Assembly, and 3) peace negotiations with all parties to begin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit meeting was finally arranged for April 16 in Arusha. A few</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">days prior to that, Nyerere called for a meeting of all the political</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">parties in Burundi. Except for PARENA, an extremist, mainly Tutsi party,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">most parties attended, including the two major ones that had formed the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">coalition government before the coup, FRODEBU and UPRONA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not much detail has been reported on the Arusha talks except that the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opposition, CNDD, called for a tightening of sanctions and regretted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that Buyoya was invited to the upcoming summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Present at the April 16 summit were: Julius Nyerere, OAU Secretary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Salim Ahmed Salim, President Mkapa of Tanzania, and presidents</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">or their delegates from Ethiopia, Cameroon, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire, Zambia. Buyoya was greeted as a fellow head of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the countries had different opinions, in the end they agreed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to the easing of the sanctions. One reason was that the sanctions were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">being violated and would continue to be more so. Another reason was that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">while there was no evidence that they had been successful politically,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">economically they had caused considerable hardship to the vulnerable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Easing the sanctions was a difficult decision for the summit; the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">continuing solidarity and perhaps unexpected toughness of the regional</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">states against Buyoya was due to the fact that he represented the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">specter of the further entrenching of military dictatorships in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the final communique from the summit, sanctions were lifted on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">food and agriculture products, education and construction materials, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">medicine. Commercial exports and imports are still banned. The country</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">leaders recognized although the first two conditions had been fulfilled,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the third had not; the country had not moved towards a strategy for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">peace and reconciliation. The leaders said they hoped that easing the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sanctions would now encourage both sides to begin unconditional</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders also called on the government of Burundi to disband the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">regroupment camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambivalence towards Buyoya</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the one hand, there are reports that Buyoya is becoming isolated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the region. Even relations with Rwanda are strained. On the other</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hand, the summit welcomed him as a head of state. This, of course,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">angered the armed opposition. Leonard Nyangoma, leader of CNDD, still</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">maintains he will negotiate only if Buyoya resigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems that while international attention has been focussed on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire, Buyoya has become more entrenched. Meanwhile the situation in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">country has not improved; if anything, it is more polarized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conclusion/Action</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sharing of power has so far been unattainable in Burundi. Since</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">independence, except for the brief period after the elections in '93</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">before the assassination of Ndadaye in the same year, the country has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been controlled by the Tutsi minority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even when the coalition government was formed after the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">assassination, the Tutsi-led army was virtually in control of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">country. Hutus have not remained quiet; extremists among them have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rebelled against the situation and the violence that has racked the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">country for years continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Julius Nyerere has explained that peace will come only if 1)the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tutsis can overcome their fear of extermination if they relinquish power</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and 2) the Hutus can be assured of their human and political rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are no quick fixes to this deep-seated problem. The hope lies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the fact that it is only the extremists on both sides that are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">continuing the violence. The majority of the population wants peace, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reconciliation efforts at the grass-roots level have been successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the first (and only) elections in '93 were not along ethnic lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As with Sudan and Somalia, Burundi is forgotten by the media. But we</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">must not forget; we must do what we can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our continuing efforts should be aimed at: - supporting the regional</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">effort to push for peaceful negotiations among all parties in Burundi -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reminding the international community that Buyoya is not a legitimate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">head of state and that he must be willing to submit to elections at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">time chosen, not by him, but by the people - supporting those who are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">working to reduce the polarization in the country through grass roots</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">efforts at reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Letters can be sent to Julius Nyerere, thanking him for his efforts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and encouraging him to continue, and to Salim Ahmed Salim, OAU Secretary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More immediate action could be aimed at: - pressuring Buyoya's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">regime to abandon the regroupment policy and let people return to their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">homes - reversing the ethnic cleansing that has taken place in Bujumbura</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- pressuring all parties, particularly Buyoya's and the CNDD of Leonard</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyangoma, to agree to unconditional negotiations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">botched election of 1992 when UNITA returned to war instead of accepting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the election results, assumed their positions within the National</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assembly. According to the new political dispensation, UNITA will head</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">four government ministries and seven junior ministerial posts, all of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">whom may be chosen by Savimbi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Savimbi will receive a salary, keep a retinue of bodyguards at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State's expense and will receive money for housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The installation of the government should have taken place in January</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">but was postponed because UNITA did not fully cooperate. Since December</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the installation has been postponed thrice. In late March U.N. Secretary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General, Kofi Annan, in his first international foray, visited Angola</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and met with Savimbi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During Annan's visit, he urged Savimbi to fully comply with terms of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the agreement. The inauguration is the final stage in the Angolan peace</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">process but many observers of Angolan politics are skeptical that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lasting peace has finally come to this beleaguered country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Portuguese newspaper, Diario de Noticias (7 March ) reported that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;UNITA occupies two thirds of Bie Province, and has recently destroyed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the bridge over the River Cutato on the road between Andulo and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cucinga.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Washington Post (April 10) reported that &quot;Recently UNITA and MPLA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">forces clashed in southern Benguela province sending about 25,000 people</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fleeing to join the ranks of the roughly 1.2 million Angolans displaced</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by the long war.&quot; The war which began in 1975 has killed an estimated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">500,000 Angolans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other pointers which suggest potential for conflict include the fact</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that about 23,000 of the 63,000 UNITA soldiers said to be demobilized</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have deserted their quartering areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are persistent press reports that UNITA may be rearming itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Washington Post (March 20), quoting Western intelligence sources,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reported that &quot;450 tons of Bulgarian arms were sent to UNITA in October</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and November 1996.&quot; The equipment included &quot;AK-47 assault rifles, 60 mm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and 120 mm mortars and rocket-propelled grenades.&quot; The Angola Peace</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monitor (APM) (Vol III *7 March 1997) noted that by November 28, &quot;a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">total of 29,698 personal weapons and 4, 521 crew-served weapons...&quot; were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">handed over to the U.N peacekeepers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the APM maintains that even &quot;the U.N. admits that between</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">30-40 percent of weapons handed over were old and unusable.&quot; Given this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">situation and the fact that &quot;key figures in UNITA's military and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">political structures including Jonas Savimbi, are to remain outside the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">new parliament and Government&quot; coupled with another factor which is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;that UNITA continues to strengthen the considerable military force it</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">keeps under arms,&quot; suggest more difficulties in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others have suggested that Savimbi's stay-away attitude is a ploy to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">keep a distance between himself and the government. This view suggests</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that Savimbi is hoping that the current government &quot;messes&quot; things up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This would give him upper hand in the next election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, UNITA troops, which reportedly joined the Zairian conflict</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on the side of Mobutu have not fared well. Some reports suggest high</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">casualties within their ranks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, the rearming of UNITA forces and the fact that a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">significant number of disarmed UNITA soldiers were not actual soldiers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">but peasants who were &quot;press-ganged by UNITA and taken to the quartering</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">areas to make up the numbers,&quot; are factors which must be adequately</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">addressed and resolved before the international community disengages</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from the Angolan peace process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - All indications are that the Liberia peace process is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">moving in the right direction however unhurriedly. According to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commanding General of the West African Peace Keeping Force (ECOMOG),</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major General Victor Malu, the country is safe, refugees can return, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">elections will be held in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) is in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">agreement with Malu's conclusion and has begun a campaign to convince</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberian refugees that the country is now safe for them to return. Malu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">however cautioned refugees hoping to return &quot;to be mentally prepared for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the massive destruction of villages and towns that took place during the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">war.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of refugee representatives from neighboring countries are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">undertaking assessment missions to &quot;see for themselves&quot; whether security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has indeed returned to their homeland. So far, some have been impressed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with the conditions they have seen. According to Rev Edwin Lloyd, who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">visited Liberia on behalf of Liberian refugees in Cote d'Ivoire,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Liberian refugees are gratified by news of the high military</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">professionalism being demonstrated by ECOMOG in pursuing its peace</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">duties in Liberia,&quot; he told ECOMOG commanders. There is no report yet of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a systematic return to the country but some refugees are known to be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">trickling in, especially from Guinea and La Cote d'Ivoire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ECOMOG, whose troop strength has been augmented in the last few</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">months to 10,000 has been deploying troops throughout Liberia with the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">help of the United States Government, which provided aircraft that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">airlifted troops from the region to Liberia last March. The additional</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">troops came from Niger, Burkina Faso, La Cote d'Ivoire, Mali and Benin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initial peacekeeping troops were largely Nigerians but included</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana, Guinea, Gambia, and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has not been any serious outbreak of violence since December</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1996 and disarmament is continuing in the southeastern part of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, disarmed soldiers in parts of the country have come under</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">attack from local people. About 10 former combatants may have been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">killed so far. Reports of criminality in many areas abound. Meanwhile</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the United Nations said that it has employed about 5,000 ex-combatants</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to do various chores including cleaning of streets and clearing of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">highways as part of its demobilization program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia's Election Commission (ECOM) was inaugurated on April 2. It</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has the immense task of conducting democratic, free and fair elections</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in a country totally destroyed by seven years of war. There is deep</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">concern that given the logistical requirement and the lack of financial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">support from the Council of State (the transitional government) the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">election probably will have to be postponed to October. Catholic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archbishop Michael Francis, called for such postponement but the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Election Commission has not released any statement in this regard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles Taylor, leader of the NPFL is opposed to any postponement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ECOM Chairman, Mr. G. Henry Andrews, a veteran journalist, has said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that it will cost $12 million to conduct the election. According to Mr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrews, the Commission has assurances from the international community</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to contribute about 80 percent of the money. However, the commission is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in arrears of $750,000, mostly wages to its employees. Mr. Andrews also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stated that the commission was installed two months behind schedule,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">leaving the commission with a shorter time to carry out its mandate than</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">anticipated in the Abuja Accord of August 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Election Commission about 11 political parties are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">already registered and certificated. The Commission believes that by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">time election day arrives at least 20 political parties will have been</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">approved. Among the newest parties are the National Patriotic Party of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rebel leader Charles Taylor, the Labor Party and another Party founded</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Harry Moniba, former Vice President of slain military dictator,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samuel Doe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alliance of seven political parties which was announced in early</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">January and committed to fielding one slate of candidates is now</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unravelling. Two parties: the United People's Party of veteran populist,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bacchus Matthews and the Unity Party have withdrawn from the alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their action followed the alliance convention at which time Cletus</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wotorson of Liberia Action Party (LAP) was elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Unity Party (UP) has decided to support United Nations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Development Program official, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf as its presidential</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">contender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wotorson named LPP activist and former student leader, Alaric Tokpa,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as his running mate. He told reporters recently that some of the new</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">political parties recently registered are considering joining the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to political observers in Monrovia, the leading contenders</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would include: Cletus Wotorson of the Alliance of Political Parties,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles Taylor of the NPP and Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf of the UP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are at least five other contenders, including rebel leader</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alhadji Kromah of ULIMO-K, who recently registered his All Liberia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coalition Party. Kromah was also recently arrested and briefly detained</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by the peacekeepers when a large quantity of hidden weapons was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">discovered and recovered from his premises. He was later &quot;pardoned&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">after apologizing for burying the weapons in his yard. The Election</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission has said that it will not allow any independent candidate to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">contest the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current momentum toward peace building in Liberia has to be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">maintained. A close monitor of the region has to take place to prevent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">any flow of arms into Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continued assistance to ECOMOG is necessary especially in ensuring</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that arms captured from rebels do not disappear. In fact some Liberians</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have suggested that ECOMOG should destroy the weapons it has collected</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in a Liberia's version of &quot;flame of peace&quot; as was done in Mali, one year</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The activities of the election commission need speedy logistical and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">financial support and the various warring factions and civilian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">politicians need to be prevailed upon to respect the result of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">electoral process while rear-guard strategy needs to be put in place to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">absorb any fall-out from the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberia peace process may be on course but its derailment is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">still possible. The international community must be unequivocal about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">what the process should achieve and vigilant about ensuring that this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">happens in the best interests of the majority of Liberians.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Washington is upbeat about prospects for increased trade</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the last Congress a bill, &quot;African Growth and Opportunity: &quot;,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was introduced on the last day but did not get far. This year the bill</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was introduced on April 24, and stands a very good chance of passing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has already received Presidential support and has potential</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bipartisan support in both Houses of Congress. Essentially the bill</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">calls for:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;1. establishment of U.S./sub- Saharan Africa Free Trade Area to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">serve as a catalyst for increasing trade and increasing private sector</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">development in the region;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. a textile initiative that would exempt sub-Saharan Africa from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">provisions of the World Trade Organizations's Textile and Clothing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agreement until exports from the region 'reach higher levels';</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. a one time appropriation of $500 million for an infrastructure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fund for Africa, which would not come from development funds used by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to help Africa; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. formation of U.S. - Africa Economic Forum that would include</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">annual high level meetings at the secretary and ministerial levels, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">discussion on 'bilateral and multi-lateral trade and investment policies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and initiatives'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a recent meeting held in Chantilly, Virginia, a suburb of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington, African representatives and U.S. business leaders were full</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of praises for the prospects of increased trade and investment in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Thabo Mbeki, Deputy President of South Africa, and heir</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">apparent to Nelson Mandela, this is now the African &quot;renaissance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary Clinton, speaking on behalf of the Clinton Administration said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that Africa &quot;was on the move.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the words of Robert Rubin, Secretary of the U.S. Treasury,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democracy has started to take root in Africa.&quot; He suggests that &quot;market</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reforms have also taken hold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting was sponsored by the Corporate Council on Africa, a quasi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lobby group interested in promoting U.S. investment in Africa. It counts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">among its leadership former U.S. government officials including Herman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cohen, former Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Woods, a former Defense Department official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the bad press Africa gets, one is expected to applaud the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">statements of the Chantilly meeting as pointing to the positive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">development in Africa, which speaker after speaker stated. But that is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the problem about imaging Africa. On the one hand some see only chaos</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and on the other hand is the &quot;success story&quot; syndrome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Glaringly absent from the deliberations is who benefits from U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investment in Africa. From all accounts, it certainly does not include,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in any significant way, the masses of Africans whose daily drudgeries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are inadequate to secure for them a higher standard of living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The struggle of the Ogoni people of Nigeria strikingly makes the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">case. Shell Corporation's behavior in Nigeria has denied the Ogoni</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">people the ability to derive a livelihood from their ancestral</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">occupation, farming and fishing, by destroying the land and polluting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the rivers and streams. The Ogoni people and the Nigerian nation have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not become better off because of Shell's investment, which spanned more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">than 30 years and generated billions of dollars. Today Ogonis are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">refugees in Benin and the United States and the Nigerian government has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">an occupation force on their land. Nine of their leaders were murdered</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by the Nigerian regime and 19 others may face a similar fate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to current statistics, U.S. investment in sub-Saharan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa is about 7% of total U.S. overseas investment. Most of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investment is in the extractive industries sector, including oil and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mining. Aside from South Africa (where there is some investment in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">manufacturing sector) other African countries with significant U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">investment include Angola, Gabon and Nigeria. In all of these countries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">there is no evidence that U.S. investment has ameliorated the condition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the local people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Angola, the years of war have meant that U.S. investment largely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">resulted in the ability of one of the protagonists to obtain the means</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to prosecute the war. As a result Angola has had to mortgage away most</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of its future oil income to foreign interests. Essentially, this means</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that it will take a long time before the average Angolan will encounter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the benefit of the resources found in his/her area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Nigeria, the military who have ruled that country for 30 of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">its 37 years of independence have appropriated all resources and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">especially oil which it then uses to create a formidable machinery that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">denies the right of the Nigerian people to choose their own leaders or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">benefit from the resources of their country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of Gabon, President Omar Bongo, a seasoned autocrat, has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">used Gabonese wealth to thwart democratic elections in his favor and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">live a life of luxury and opulence. It will be of little surprise if</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">some &quot;Kabila&quot; arose in Gabon soon. Bongo, like Mobutu, belongs to a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">breed of African leaders referred to as &quot;political dinosaurs&quot; by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">late French President Mitterrand.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Everyone now seems to agree that the Mobutu era is at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">its end. But there is no common agreement as what is in store for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's third largest country and perhaps its richest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laurent Desire Kabila, long time guerilla foe to Mobutu, is said to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">now have all the cards in his hands. His recent pronouncement of single-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">handedly heading a transitional government is cause for pause. Any</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">transitional instrument, to be seen as credible and worthy of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">international support, must include Zaire's pro-democracy forces as well</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as those sectors of the population who have historically championed the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cause of popular participation, economic justice and freedom for all of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the negotiations now mediated by South Africa and the United</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nations do not provide for this. There is a pre-occupation with having</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila meet Mobutu &quot;face to face&quot;. Not enough attention is given to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">involvement of other sectors of the population in these negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is dangerous to say the least especially when multinational</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">corporations are flocking into Zaire and entering into billion dollar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">deals with the rebel leader while he is shooting his way to power. With</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Zairian army in utter disarray and Mobutu's health uncertain, Kabila</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">can believe that he is the answer to Zairian woes. But no one person has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the monopoly of knowledge on how best to solve Zaire's difficult and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">numerous problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the people of Zaire, particularly those who stood up to Mobutu,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">without guns, should not be left out of the debate as to which way Zaire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">should head. Any hasty decision by the world community to ordain Kabila</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the new &quot;strong man&quot; of Zaire would not only be political folly, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">totally callous. What is more, rebels have been accused of massacres and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">summary executions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most recently, according to press reports, rebels refused to allow</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">access to refugee camps where Rwandans are dying, about 60 persons a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">day. This was done in apparent disregard to instructions from Kabila,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">who earlier, gave permission for relief workers to enter the refugee</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">camps. Arguments that Kabila's forces won't disintegrate don't hold</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">water. If news about Kabila's deals with multinational corporations,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">including diamond mogul DeBeers, trickles to the front line, there is no</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">telling what the reaction will be. It is even difficult to predict what</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">would happen when rebels get a taste of new found wealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there are even more compelling reasons why Kabila should not be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">allowed to become Zaire's &quot;strongman&quot; by shooting his way to power. In</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the region of the Great Lakes, all current governments came to power</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">through the force of arms: Mobutu of Zaire, Kagame of Rwanda, Buyoya of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi and even Museveni of Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a region awash in arms and numerous guerilla warfares. In</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda there are at least three different groups violently campaigning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to remove the regime. They may not pose any immediate threat to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Museveni government but protracted warfare will severely hamper</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">development activities in regions where they are concentrated. There are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">guerilla armies in Burundi and Rwanda, all involved in violent campaigns</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to remove their regimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result none of those countries are any closer to reconciliation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">than they were three years ago when both of their presidents were killed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in a plane crash, an incident which catalyzed the Rwandan genocide of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 150,000 people have been killed in Burundi since its first</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">democratically elected president, Melchior Ndadaye, was killed three</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">years ago. In nearby Sudan, the current government came to power</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">violently and is at war with the SPLA. The situation is not helped when</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. policy encourages countries in the region, including Eritrea,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda and Ethiopia, to employ violence as the means to remove the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government of Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amidst all this violence, the lives of ordinary persons are taken</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">away. In many cases these lives have been lost in vain. The blood</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">spilled by the millions who have died in Sudan has not generated peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of more than one million in Rwanda (since its independence)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has not achieved anything for those who perpetrated these gruesome acts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If anything, it has meant greater untold suffering for the people in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;whose interest&quot; they claimed to have acted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that Kabila is able to put together a war machinery to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">remove Mobutu can not be said to be the primary reason he is succeeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is Mobutu's record that is doing him in. His army loots, pillages and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">flees; it does not fight. One reason why Mobutu is referred to as a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">repressive dictator is because of his response to the resistance mounted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">against his regime by unarmed people. These democratic forces recently</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">held a two-day successful protest in Kinshasa, a city of 4 million</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">people, with &quot;stay-at-home&quot; actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, they must have significant support among the people of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire. Kabila should not be encouraged to usurp power only because he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">carries the gun. There are ample historical justifications that those</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">who capture state power by force of arms do not necessarily bring peace</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and justice to their people. On the other hand those who take the noble</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">path of peaceful negotiations and popular participation hold great</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">potential of ensuring stability and the possibility of reconciliation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and reconstruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is one reason why Nelson Mandela of South Africa, stands out</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">among African leaders. The lessons of Liberia, Rwanda, Angola, Somalia,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">amongst others are only too fresh in our minds not to heed the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">instructions of the South African model.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What the people of Zaire deserve is perhaps best captured in an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">article written by the writer, Louis Kalonji (Africa News bulletin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">15/04/97 No. 322). According to him, the people of Zaire expect from any</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">negotiation the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. They want radical change. Obviously they want the war to end, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">at the same time any negotiation must take a hard long look at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reasons for Zaire's present lamentable state. Most of all the population</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">wants to see an end to Mobutu's dictatorship that has ruined the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. They want to see the election process back on track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. They want a solution to the delicate question of Zairian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">nationality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. They want a firm pledge that the democratization process will</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">continue. The basic terms of reference for this process are the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">conclusions drawn up by the Sovereign National Conference, relating to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a. the formation of a genuine government of national unity, Such a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government must include representatives from the various political</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;families and civil society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b. The re-organization of a truly national army free from all tribal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and ethnic elements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">c. the organization of free and open elections under the supervision</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the United Nations and countries friendly towards Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">d. There must be public accountability when it comes to administering</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">state finances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are minimal and realistic goals which the international</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">community can support. Kabila needs to be told that popular</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">participation, economic accountability, good governance and sustainable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">peace can not come out of the barrel of a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Multinationals eager to invest in Zaire must consider that those with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">whom they allied have the mandate of the Zairian people through popular</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">consensus. Their investment must not oil any machinery which would deny</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the people of Zaire the benefits of their well endowed country and their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">right to choose their own leaders in a manner respectful of their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">history.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attending the meeting -- to take place at the ECA's headquarters here</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in Addis Ababa on Wednesday 7 May 1997 -- will be representatives of all</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The GIIC provides a framework for bridging the gaps between the</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the same day the GIIC will release its &quot;Statement of Addis Ababa&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which strongly supports private and public sector partnerships in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">building the African Information Society. The GIIC Statement proposes a</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">plans for National Information and Communications Infrastructure (NICI)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">within each African country. Thus, the AISI should:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Be African led, but within a global context; - Take into</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">consideration the substantial work on NICI in Africa that has preceded</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">it, and related work worldwide on developing the Information Society; -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Encourage developing countries to cooperate with each other, as well as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with the developed world; - Promote African and global private sector</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">leadership in the introduction of NICI in Africa, together with active</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">participation from the public sector, civil society and international</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">organizations; - Be driven by applications and services and not by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">technology; - Foster transparent plans and policy frameworks for NICI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">involving all relevant stakeholders, based on the promotion of: - rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in information access and use; - global trade and investment; -</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">interoperability and appropriate standards; - privacy, data protections,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">data security and intellectual property rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, the GII Commission encourages the ECA to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Develop an on-going mechanism for private sector participation in</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - The Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA) has released</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">its 1996 state of the media report on Southern Africa to coincide with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the World Press Freedom Day, May 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report titled 'So This Is Democracy?' is a compilation of media</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">freedom violations that took place in the year 1996. These media freedom</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">violations were monitored by the MISA Secretariat here in Windhoek.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1996 report has on record 124 Alerts and 31 press releases. Of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">these alerts 116 were issued by MISA's Information Unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In part, the report says alerts issued in 1996 show a similar trend</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to that seen during the previous year. The same three countries which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">headed the 1995 alerts league - Zambia, Zimbabwe and Namibia - again</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">came out top in 1996 with 49, 18 and 17 alerts issued respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But says the report, MISA's media monitoring work is not about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">compiling tables and statistics, and the number of alerts issued is &quot;as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">much a reflection of the effectiveness of MISA's information gathering</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as it is about the state of media freedom in the countries concerned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report says that the monopoly of the media by states and business</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">conglomerates also stood in the way of media development in as much the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">same way as unfriendly media legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nonetheless,&quot; says the report, &quot;Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Namibia again</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stand out because they are all multi-party democracies with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">democratically-elected governments where media freedom and freedom of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">expression are being eroded despite the existence of constitutions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">guaranteeing freedom of expression and, in the case of Namibia, media</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">freedom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other countries such as Angola, Lesotho and Mozambique, media</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">freedom monitoring work was hampered by largely the poor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">telecommunications system. However, further research into countries like</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angola, Lesotho and Tanzania revealed that media freedom situation there</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was equally unpleasant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It adds that the monitoring of and the campaign against violations of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">media freedom and free expression, with a view to promoting a greater</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">understanding of issues which lie at the heart of the democratisation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">process, therefore remains MISA's top priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the preface of the report, Chairperson of the MISA Trust Funds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Board, Justice John Manyarara says official and unofficial censorship of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the media exist in various forms in the Southern African Development</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community (SADC) region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The practice,&quot; adds Justice Manyarara, &quot;operates against media</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">freedom and editorial independence and justifies monitoring of media</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">activities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MISA's Governing Council Chairperson Clara Olsen notes in her</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">foreword to the report that the outlook on the freedom of expression on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the SADC region continues to be bleak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is little sign that this important human right is recognised</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for what it is, a prerequisite to the democratic development of a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">country,&quot; Olsen says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olsen concludes her foreword by saying that media in the SADC</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">countries must lead the way in informing governments and people in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">general about the advent of the new information age - and that the SADC</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">countries can only be part of this new age if media are free,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unfettered, independent and developed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Archbishop Desmond Tutu has made an impassioned appeal to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africans right across the political spectrum who were involved in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">political acts which might lead to criminal charges or civil actions for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">damages to apply for amnesty within the next six days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His appeal was recorded for broadcast tonight on SABC Television's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">popular programme, TRC Special Report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deadline for amnesty applications is midnight on Saturday May 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the deadline has passed, people who have committed acts,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">omissions or offences which are associated with political objectives and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">who have not applied for amnesty will be liable for prosecution or civil</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">actions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a cry from the heart,&quot; Archbishop Tutu said. &quot;I appeal to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">all of you, right across the political spectrum, please take this golden</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opportunity to apply for amnesty on the most generous terms possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His appeal selected a number of categories of people for special</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mention: -- Members of the Security Forces, including those involved in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cross- border operations; -- Township activists such as those in Self-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence Units; -- Other township residents such as those living in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hostels; -- Operatives of Military Intelligence and the CCB; and --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders of political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The categories identified include elements of the former South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African Defence Force such as the Directorate of Special Tasks, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Directorate of Covert Collection, Special Forces (&quot;Spesmagte&quot;) and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">national servicemen who witnessed or have knowledge of acts which could</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lead to prosecutions or civil actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also speaking to Special Report, Archbishop Tutu warned: &quot;As far as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the TRC is concerned, blanket amnesty is out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dealing with suggestions that blanket amnesty might have to be given</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">if the Amnesty Committee could not complete its work, he said the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of Justice had agreed to a proposal to enlarge the Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It could also sit until early next year if necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The full text of the Chairperson's appeal follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;THE ARCHBISHOP'S APPEAL TO THE NATION:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dear Fellow South Africans:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a cry from the heart. May the 10th is just around the corner</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on Saturday. That is the deadline for applications for amnesty. I appeal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to all of you, right across the political spectrum, please take this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">golden opportunity to apply for amnesty on the most generous terms</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This applies to you, leaders of political parties, this applies to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">you, people who were in the Security Forces. It applies to you who were</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">involved in cross-border raids, because you are exposed to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">possibility of civil proceedings for damages against you by those who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">were victims of your</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I appeal to you who were in SDUs in the townships, to you in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hostels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I appeal to you who were in the CCB and Military Intelligence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This amnesty is one that would expunge any criminal or civil</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">liability you are likely to have. Please come forward because this is an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opportunity to put the past behind you; to help in the process of your</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">own healing and the healing of this beautiful land. Please come.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His comments regarding the possibility of blanket amnesty being</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">granted if the TRC cannot finish its work follow:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have asked the Minister of Justice and he has agreed to our</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">request that the Amnesty Committee should be enlarged. This is in order</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to ensure that all the applications are dealt with by our committee. We</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hope that it would be able to have finished its work at best at the end</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of this year. It just might be necessary for them to continue into the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">first part of next year before we present our report in March. As far as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the TRC is concerned blanket amnesty is out. It would make nonsense of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">all the work we have done hitherto to say because we are unable to deal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with the applications, let us now grant blanket amnesty. It would be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">very difficult to justify to the victims....&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Mouille Point, once the Cinderella stretch of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlantic coastline, is set to become the Riviera of the Cape, with major</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">developments and a massive upgrade of facilities planned for the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plans for a new Waterfront access road, a public park, pedestrian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">walkways and cycle paths, improved sport and recreational facilities,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">international hotels and a multi-million rand upgrade of the beachfront</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are expected to transform this neglected part of the city into a tourist</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hub.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By providing improved facilities, the city council hopes to form a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">natural link between this area and the Waterfront.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the growth of tourism in the Western Cape, Mouille Point has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">become an area with enormous development potential,&quot; said deputy city</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">planner Basil Tommy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spectacular views of the sea and the mountains from this area and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">its proximity to the beaches of the Atlantic seaboard, the central</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">business district and the Waterfront all added to the attraction, he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plans for the area include a new road linking the Western Boulevard</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to Beach Rd in Mouille Point, as part of a development framework for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Green Point common area. The road, parallel to Portswood Road, will</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">provide easier access to the Waterfront from the Atlantic Seaboard side,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and alleviate traffic congestion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other ideas for the council-owned common include pedestrian walkways</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and cycle pathways with links to surrounding areas, improved sporting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">facilities and a public park. The framework has been negotiated through</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">an extensive public participation programme and is expected to be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">finalised by June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, private-owned land along the coastline is being snapped up</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by developers who see Mouille Point as the perfect location for hotels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Planned projects along the coastline include the R150-million five-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">star sectional title Villa Via hotel at Granger Bay, the R220-million</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gateway sectional title hotel project and a R200-million international</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hotel between Surrey and Rothsay roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Villa Via, at the Water Club in Granger Bay, is under</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">construction and building of the other two hotels is expected to start</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">later this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">La Splendida Luxury Suites, a new R10-million hotel development along</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this coastline, opened its doors in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To increase the viability of their projects some investors have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">undertaken to contribute to the upliftment of the beachfront area</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">between Granger Bay and the lighthouse at a cost of millions of rands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plans for this area include extensive landscaping and the creation of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a spectacular ocean boulevard. The beachfront plan is expected to be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">completed by the middle of the year and implementation is expected</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">before December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have the opportunity to reintroduce the kind of activities that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">used to take place along the Sea Point promenade at the old Carousel,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which was a place where people met and socialised,&quot; said Mr Tommy of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">planned ocean walkway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rollerbladers and joggers already frequent the pavement stretch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">between Granger Bay and the lighthouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Town planners are also negotiating with lease-holders on council land</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on the stretch between the lighthouse and the Three Anchor Bay boat ramp</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to get them to improve facilities in this area. Among these are the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">little blue train, the maze and the putt-putt course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The possible downgrading of Beach Road, which is a provincial main</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">road, is being investigated. The plan is to reduce traffic on this road</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and make it safer to cross to the beachfront.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contributing to the area's facelift is the recent upgrading of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mouille Point lighthouse, the revamp of the commercial building at 129</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beach Road and the renovation of several older buildings along the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">coastline. The historic Fort Wynyard will be upgraded to house a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">military museum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More development opportunities could become available along Portswood</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Road, with the consolidation of health facilities at City Park and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somerset hospitals and the subsequent disposal of surplus land and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">buildings, said Mr Tommy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inner Cape investment chairman Jochen Buechel, developer of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gateway project, will contribute between R1-million and R1,5-million to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the upgrading of the beachfront in front of this hotel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This area is fast becoming the Cote d'Azur of the Cape,&quot; said Mr</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buechel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Buechel, who said developers should contribute to the upliftment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the areas in which they build, has pledged R500 000 towards a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">community project to look after street children in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roy Licht, director of TDC which will develop the still unnamed hotel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">between Surrey and Rothsay roads with an international hotel group, is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">kicking off the transformation of the beachfront by financing drawing up</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the plan. He will pay another R1-million towards implementation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mouille Point is a fantastic location and it has the potential to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">become the jewel of the Cape, it just needs an impetus. This can become</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Riviera of Cape Town and we are planning to give Camps Bay a run for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">its money,&quot; said Mr Licht.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said upgrading of the beachfront as the first phase of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">extension of the Waterfront. The beachfront upgrade would make the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waterfront &quot;work better&quot;, because it had become &quot;commercialised&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The upgrade will melt the Waterfront into the open recreational</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">areas of Mouille Point,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Licht said Cape Town, with its international reputation, was the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;buzz word&quot; in property and Mouille Point was &quot;the right side of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">railway line&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Granger Bay Trust, developers of Villa Via, have brick-paved and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">landscaped the sidewalk area outside the Water Club as part of their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">contribution towards the link between the Waterfront and Mouille Point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our project acted as a catalyst for development in this area,&quot; said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">project manager Clive Lurie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, local residents have accepted that they &quot;cannot put a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">finger in the dyke&quot; of development in the area, said Bronnie Harding,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">chairman of the Mouille Point Ratepayers' Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Providing the development conforms to council regulations, we cannot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stop it. With the ever-increasing Waterfront, Mouille Point has become</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the most sought-after area in the city,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kisangani - While talks on a peace settlement in Zaire continue,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rebel leader Laurent Desire Kabila has introduced an extraordinary third</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">force that has the potential to upset any negotiated settlement: instant</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">democracy, which Mr Kabila promises to bring to every captured city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kabila's high-speed elections are astounding both for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">simplicity of their method and for the contrast they offer with previous</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African liberation movements that have often promised democracy, but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">taken years to deliver elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under intense international pressure, President Mobutu Sese Seko</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">allowed opposition political parties only in 1990. Since then, for seven</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">years, he has successfully resisted scheduling free elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just six days after Mr Kabila's army captured Kisangani (formerly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stanleyville), Zaire's third-largest city, Mr Kabila and his advisors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">swept into the city to set up a government. Six hours later, the first</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">elections were completed for the commissars for each of Kisangani's six</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">administrative zones. The next day a provincial governor, vice-governor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and mayor were elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How does one organise elections in six hours? The process began when</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">representatives from Mr Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberation of Congo fanned out to the six municipal zones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of people gathered around humble meeting halls and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">administrative buildings. Earlier in the week, alliance officials</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">announced the elections would be held, but no schedule was announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most who joined the crowds of voters heard by word of mouth or simply</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">saw a crowd forming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Tshopo, the most populous city zone, alliance justice minister</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkongolo Mwenze conducted the elections with a few aides and a single</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">soldier. A chair and two tables were set in front of a crowd of about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">400 people. Mr Mwenze climbed atop a table and began explaining, in a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">loud bellow, the unusual procedure that was to follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first stage was the campaign: each of 25 Tshopo candidates got a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">chance to climb atop the table and present himself to the crowd (there</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are no female candidates and few women in the crowd). The first</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">candidate, Honore Myango, tried to explain that he is not a member of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the party of Mr Mobutu, although his brother is a Mobutist. His speech</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was drowned out by a cacophony of shouts in the crowd that gradually</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">coalesced around a chant of &quot;Mouvancier, Mouvancier,&quot; the name for Mr</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu's political family that has become an epithet in Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Myango stepped down and a new candidate's name was bellowed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stepped up and shouted: &quot;I have never worked before, but I want to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">now.&quot; Thunderous laughter and &quot;Ooooooo&quot; sounds leapt from the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">increasingly excited crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third candidate faced raucous cries that he shouldn't run because</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he drinks too much. A fourth candidate simply held forth a Red Cross</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">business card. &quot;Mouvancier, Mouvancier!&quot; the crowd replied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poye Poyo, a 33-year-old assistant professor, stepped on the table</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and, without a word, tied a white strip of cloth around his head, a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">symbol of support for the rebel alliance. The crowd went wild with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cheers and chants of support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all the candidates were presented, the list was winnowed down</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to four. Voting was by show of hands: each candidate climbed onto the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">table and members of the crowd were asked to raise a hand if they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">supported keeping the candidate on the short list. Then the crowd was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">asked to raise a hand if they opposed the candidate remaining on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">list. If more hands opposed, the candidate is eliminated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One by one, candidates were cut until only two remained. Mr Poyo, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila supporter, was the overwhelming favourite. A 28-year-old</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">university student was elected his vice-commissar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Tshopo and other zones, greater age was tantamount to complicity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with Mr Mobutu. Virtually every candidate over 40 was greeted with the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">familiar derisive chants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We reject this system because it is undemocratic. The university is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">very near and there are many students here,&quot; complained Mr Myango, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">former vice-commissar for Tshopo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His comments were drowned with bitter shouts. &quot;Old people have</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">spoiled this country. They have eaten for a long time and must leave the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">place to young people,&quot; one young man screamed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across Kisangani the results were similar: young opposition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">candidates captured all six commissar posts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, one Mobutu official, considered an honest man, was elected</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">vice-commissar. The next day, thousands of residents gathered at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">city soccer stadium to repeat the process to elect a provincial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">governor, vice-governor and mayor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a crude voting system is far from perfect. Lack of advance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">notice kept many from voting or standing for office. Because voting took</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">place at a single location, rural voters were effectively excluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, mob democracy, no matter how flawed, was preferable to no</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">democracy to most Kisangani residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were squabbles over whether voters could raise one hand or two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At times it was difficult to determine which candidate had more votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In most cases, public opinion was overwhelmingly against Mobutu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">officials and in favour of the most hard-core opposition figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, when results were close, the crowds had a clear sense of fair</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he had broad support, Obotela Rashidi, a history professor,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was eliminated as a candidate for governor and returned to his position</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">in the heart of a crowd of thousands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A separate list of candidates for vice-governor had been prepared</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">without his name and none of Mr Kabila's advisors had thought of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">allowing unsuccessful candidates to run again for lower office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After sustained protest from the crowd, Professor Rashidi was bodily</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lifted and passed hand over hand over the crowd and to the stage, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">elected vice-governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the flaws, no alliance candidates stood for office while many</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutists tried and failed to win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leader of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress, the main</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">national opposition party, was elected governor while UDPS candidates</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">won in four of six zones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kisangani elections came the same day that Mr Kabila announced he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">was banning all political party activity for the duration of the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly, Mr Kabila is highly popular in Kisangani, in part because</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">disdain for Mr Mobutu and his army runs so deep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the alliance has virtually no political organisation and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">might lose at levels below the presidency if its candidates were to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">stand against better organised national parties, such as UDPS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a rough system of democracy does offer the rebels other</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">practical advantages: &quot;There is no one here. The officials all fled the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">city. We have to have someone in charge before we leave to continue the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">fight. This is not perfect democracy, but it is the best we can do,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">explained Mawampanga Mwana Nanga, Mr Kabila's minister of economics and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">finance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is possible that Mr Kabila, like many revolutionaries before him,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will lose enthusiasm for democracy once he captures complete power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the moment, the need to give power to the people, fight</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">corruption and work hard are the themes of every speech by Mr Kabila and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">his representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such pledges are helping build their popularity and building a bank</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of promises that will be hard to renounce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By bringing elections to occupied territory, Mr Kabila also deftly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">increases his leverage in negotiations with Mr Mobutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How, Mr Kabila asks, can he return power to Mobutu officials when the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">people have elected their own leaders in occupied territory?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - A leading business consultant has urged the government to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">deal quickly with violent crime to free police resources to deal with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the constant rise in business fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deloitte &amp; Touche director Jonathan Briant said businesses also</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">needed to take the initiative, rather than wait for the government to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tackle the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Until violent crime is brought under control, the resources of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">government will never be properly focused on the insidious crimes that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">undermine the foundation on which the new economic prosperity must be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">built,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Briant was responding to a report that fraud in European Union</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">countries was costing member states up to 60-billion ECUs (R12-billion)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most frauds in these states went unreported and there was no reliable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">data available on their extent. In an effort to stem the fraud, Europe's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">governing body, the European Commission, had suggested that member</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">states should, among other things, consider co-operating through the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reality for South Africans is that reliance on governmental</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">action is a luxury we cannot afford. It is very much up to us to protect</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ourselves from fraud,&quot; Mr Briant said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fraud in South Africa's public and private sectors has been on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">increase. Various commissions of inquiry have been set up to probe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reports of impropriety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These reports include a statement by finance minister Trevor Manuel</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The Olympic Peace Initiative launched with local gangs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">last week does not oblige gangsters to stop their lucrative drugs trade</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and it will not protect them against prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of drugs is the most controversial element of what Bid</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Company chief executive Chris Ball describes as a &quot;brave&quot; initiative.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr Ball, who made it clear the gangs-for-peace strategy was not a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bid project but an initiative of the independent Cape Town Community</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olympic Forum, emphasised: &quot;Any activity which contravenes the law must</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">be prosecuted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the tricky subject of the exclusion of drug dealing from the terms</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the revolutionary accord between the forum and local gangs, Mr Ball</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said: &quot;It would be nice to wave a flag and stop drug activity overnight,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">but you could only do that through draconian measures, or a set of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">activities over a period of time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bid Company had supported the initiative because &quot;it is better to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have a peace accord, and to attempt to do something positive about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">violence and crime than not to try at all&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This should be seen only as the first stage, and if one wants</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">criminal activity to cease completely, gangsters need to be integrated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">into society,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The initiative is an unusual type of activity, which is not part of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the bid's job. It is not our task to restructure the social fabric of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the community, but if the bid can be used as a catalyst to achieve</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">something constructive, then it is to be encouraged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no question of the bid being used to &quot;legitimise</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">gangsters&quot;. The forum's initiative was an opportunity for the gangs to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">make a positive contribution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - When her proud parents had her christened 21 years ago in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angola, little could they have realised how appropriate their choice of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">name would be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And coupled with her surname (coast in Portuguese) it seemed Marine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Costa, recently of Luanda, was destined for things aquatic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She's in serious training for her debut at the Berg River Canoe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">marathon in July, but before that she will go to Hong Kong for the world</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dragon boat championships - last weekend was taken up competing in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African river rafting championships on the Orange River.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what attracted Costa - who has wanted to be a lawyer for as long</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as she can remember - to the Mother City?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About two years ago she met a group of South African pilots in Luanda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">where she was living with her mother, who works for the Dutch embassy,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">her father who's with the United Nations, and three younger siblings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Education in Angola is in a mess. In fact it's a big joke, and one</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the pilots suggested I go to Cape Town to study law. I came for a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">week in 1995, absolutely loved it, and returned to Cape Town in January</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">last year after completing my schooling in Luanda,&quot; said Marine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But an Angolan matric wasn't enough for a ticket to a South African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">university so last year was a case of around the course again (in an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">educational sense) at Boston College so she could enroll at Unisa to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">start her legal studies. She hopes to study fulltime at the University</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of Cape Town next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This isn't her first time away from home. She lived in Rotterdam for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">four years with her mother and grand parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That was great, but the weather terrible. There's also a huge</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">difference going to first-world Holland from third-world Angola,&quot; said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marine. &quot;I used to swim a lot back home in Luanda and was lucky to be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">able to carry on at indoor pools while at school in Rotterdam.&quot; Other</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ports of call before Holland were short stays in Cape Verde Islands and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Portugal before settling once again in Angola - all this before she was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then Cape Town beckoned and after her unexpected second matric, she</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">moved into a flat in Rondebosch with a friend and was introduced to a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sport she had never dreamt of pursuing - canoeing. Apart from swimming,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the only other sport that had interested her at that stage was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">basketball, while she was at school in Luanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My new flatmate, Bronwyn Hobbs, who is hooked on canoeing, having</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">taken the plunge just after last year's Berg River marathon, invited me</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">along, so I went down to Sandvlei for a couple of training sessions with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">her and soon got the hang of it,&quot; said Marine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Truth of the matter is she took to it like a duck to water, joined</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Peninsula Canoe Club and met Edgar Boehm, a veteran of 23 &quot;Bergs&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the past seven years Boehm has introduced dozens of novices to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the Berg. In January each year his group - called Ducklings - take to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the water. The Ducklings - normally about 15 budding Berg marathoners -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">climb into canoes under the watchful eye of Boehm to get the feel on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">calm waters of Sandvlei. About three Sundays later they graduate to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Breede River for a month of Sundays before hitting the Berg where the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">master passes on his tips. When the main event arrives (July 9 to 12</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">this year) only about five original Ducklings start the punishing event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marine is committed to being there. &quot;All my training is aimed at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Berg. I'll definitely be at the start in Paarl. There is no doubt about</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">that,&quot; she said after another gruelling session at the gym.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She goes to the gym every day, but doesnot use weights. &quot;I tend to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">put on muscle very easily and don't want to end up looking like Rambo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am quite strong. After canoeing for only four months I can pull</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">away from people who have been at it for years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How did she get involved in dragon boat paddling?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many canoeists try paddle skiing, river rafting and dragon boats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of my friends suggested it. I enjoy the way you have to work out</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">there, I like exercise. The SA Dragon Boat Association were looking for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">people for Hong Kong and naturally I jumped at the chance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team will compete in Macau, warming up for the world</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">championships to be held on the Shing Mun River, Hong Kong. The event,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">from June 12 to 15, promises to be an historic occasion as the regatta</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will form part of the festivities celebrating Hong Kong's return to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">China on July 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And although dragon boat regattas look to be more fun and festive</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">than conventional canoeing, it's hard work as Marine discovered at the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">thrice-weekly sessions at Sandvlei and the Waterfront.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Each boat has a crew of 22 that includes a pace-setting drummer and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">helmsman. So 20 paddlers have to keep perfect timing or there's trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I first started I used to drag my paddle, but that didn't last</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">long, unless you enjoy having your elbow pounded by the paddler behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Timing is important. Each paddler must take their cue from the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">person diagonally in front at the same time keeping pace with the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">drummer. The action is similar to paddling a river raft.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">between president Mobutu of Zaire and the country's rebel leader Laurent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila after both sides showed reluctance to attend peace talks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extraordinary spectacle of President Mandela kicking his heels on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">board a South African naval vessel for more than a day waiting for the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">antagonists in Zaire's civil war to show up for peace talks over the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">weekend, demonstrated great forbearance and goodwill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by all accounts Mr Mandela let it be known that his patience was</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">call to rebel leader Laurent Kabila to ensure that he eventually arrived</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no compelling reason for the South African Government to be</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">altruistic interest in ending the immense suffering of millions of</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa is not a superpower, but Mr Mandela and his government</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have shown that they are willing and able to act as peacemakers in Zaire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- and probably elsewhere in Africa. Their willingness is not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unconditional or open-ended, and it should not be taken for granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their commitment to the quest for peace must be fully and sincerely</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - FW de Klerk and former National Party ministers who held</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">security portfolios are considering applying to the Truth Commission for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move is being discussed at a federal executive meeting in Cape</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Town today, with just five days to go to the deadline for amnesty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who may seek amnesty could include Mr De Klerk, as former state</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">president and commander-in-chief, former law and order minister Hernus</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kriel and Roelf Meyer, a former deputy law and order minister and one-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">time minister of defence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Truth Commission allows it, they would seek amnesty in their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">official, and not personal, capacities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the African National Congress announced its national</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">executive committee had decided that past and present members of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">committee and the various command structures of Umkhonto weSizwe should</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">apply for amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Constand Viljoen, former head of the defence force, announced</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">earlier that he would apply for amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Truth Commission head Desmond Tutu at the weekend made an impassioned</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">appeal for all those who had been involved in gross violations of human</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rights, and had not yet applied for amnesty, to do so by the May 10</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">deadline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archbishop Tutu asked leaders of political parties, security forces,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">military intelligence operatives, as well as members of self-defence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">units and hostel dwellers, to come forward to the amnesty committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty would expunge them of all criminal and civil liability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archbishop Tutu firmly ruled out the possibility of a blanket</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">amnesty, saying it would make nonsense of the TRC's work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NP confirmed today that the subject of amnesty applications was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">on the agenda its federal executive meeting. It is understood no</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">specific recommendation will be tabled at the start of the discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr De Klerk has said publicly several times, and in the party's most</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recent submission to the Truth Commission, that neither he nor his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">security portfolio ministers gave orders for murders or other gross</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">violations of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Top NP members have so far declined to apply for amnesty on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">grounds that it is designed for those personally culpable for human</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">rights violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr De Klerk has said that he and his ministers accept full</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">responsibility, because of their official posts, for the events of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">apartheid years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the weekend, Dene Smuts, Democratic Party spokeswoman on the Truth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission, lashed out at the failure of NP leaders to apply for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their failure and their claims of &quot;clean hands&quot; meant they had left</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Police have warned elderly people living on their own to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exercise &quot;extreme caution&quot; after two women were murdered at the weekend</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- and at least one of them opened the door to her killer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The body of 76-year-old Maureen Botha of Longacres Flats in Sans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Souci Road, Newlands was found on Saturday evening by her son Lewellyn</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botha, a well-known environmental law consultant, after her family had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">tried to phone her throughout the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Botha, who would have celebrated her 77th birthday yesterday, had</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">been strangled.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police say her flat was ransacked and there were several appliances</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her body was discovered about 7pm. She was last seen alive at 3pm on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday, but someone had spoken to her on the telephone at 7pm that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A R50 000 reward is being offered for information leading to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">successful conviction of her killer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Botha said his mother had been a compassionate person who had a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;broad family&quot; because even strangers she met had felt &quot;close and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">comfortable&quot; with her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But she was also very security-conscious and would not let strangers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">into her flat. I am convinced her killer was some one she trusted,&quot; said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Botha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the second murder in the area in two days. A 64-year-old</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">woman was stabbed to death in her Claremont home on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The body of Anne Catherine Steele was discovered by her son Laurence,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">who last saw her alive when he left for work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Steele's body was found in the passage of her home in Mountain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have described the murder as one of the most brutal killings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">they have ever seen. Mrs Steele was stabbed in the face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A worrying aspect of the murder, say police, is that here too they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">believe the victim opened the door for her killer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police spokesman Mark Romburgh said senior citizens needed to be very</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cautious about who they let into their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also called on elderly people to register themselves at their</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">local police stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are also asking that neighbours and family members call on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">elderly on a regular basis, so that they do not become isolated and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">vulnerable to attacks,&quot; Captain Romburgh said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest attacks come in spite of last month's arrest of a gang</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">targeting elderly people in the southern suburbs. The gang gained access</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to people's homes through a member posing as a messenger after finding</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their names on post in letterboxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were linked to an attack on a woman and her elderly mother in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenilworth in February in which the mother's arms were broken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January the gang allegedly lured another victim out of her home in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenilworth by telling her an elderly woman had fallen on the pavement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and needed help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another gang, allegedly linked to last month's murder of 83-year-old</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constantia widow Frances Thomson, was arrested soon after the murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another among the spate of elderly women attacked at home was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">botanist Elsie Esterhuysen, 84, who survived.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In occasion of Baker's visit about sixty reporters were in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sahrawi camps. They could visit the refugee camps and make themselves an</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">European parliamentary groups and 25 political VIPs from Europe and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Latin America were present to prove to Baker that the Sahrawi issue is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">not a marginal conflict, and to show that the Sahrawi people is not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">alone. They handed over to Baker a document ( spanish or french), in</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">which they express their concern, asking Baker to do all his possible to</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bent, veterans of the war. The talks with Sahrawi officials began</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">immediately in a tent. To the media James Baker terms his talks as</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">excellent. He says that the problem was complex and extremely difficult,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">but it was not hopeless &quot;or I wouldn't otherwise be here&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am convinced that the people in this region are overly weary with</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambian police, in collaboration with Interpol, have impounded at least 150 cars suspected to have been stolen from Botswana, Malawi, South Africa and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the Zambian Police, Standwell Lungu, said Monday in Lusaka that the cars impounded last week were being examined at the Lilayi Police Training School in Lusaka to determine their origin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experts are examining the vehicles to determine whether they have been tampered with. If it is established they have been interfered with, then the owners of the vehicles will be liable for prosecution,&quot; Lungu said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the vehicles were seized in Zambia's northern copperbelt town of Kitwe; Livingstone, in Southern Zambia, and in Lusaka, the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the vehicles impounded were the German-made BMW and Mercedez Benz as well as several Japanese Toyota and Datsun brands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lungu said owners who had claimed their cars stolen must provide proof of ownership to avoid prosecution. &quot;The onus is on the owners of these vehicles to produce evidence that they bought the cars,&quot; he said. &quot;To say one was not aware the car he bought was stolen is no defence in law,&quot; Lungu warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that there were instances when people from neighboring countries crossed into Zambia to sell their cars, only to report later that their vehicles had been stolen so they could claim insurance back home. The same practice had occured in Mozambique concerning South African car owners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interpol has helped police in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe mount similar operations to those in Zambia. Mozambican and South African police conducted raids in Maputo and other Mozambican urban centers a few months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The search for stolen vehicles is being conducted under the auspices of the Defence and Security Committee of the 12-nation Southern African Development Community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the committee's tasks is checking cross-border criminal activities, including drug trafficking.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwe's indigenous African population still shuns cremation as an alternative to burial, the Harare City Council said Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare's acting mayor, Edward Mapuranga, told the Zimbabwe Inter-Africa News Agency that just 74 Africans had been cremated in Harare since 1980 compared to 12,365 European settlers over the same period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 12,438 people had been cremated in Harare since independence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first Africans cremated were two infants in 1984, some four years after independence. The first African adults were cremated three years later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, only 38 African adults and 36 infants have been cremated in the capital city of some 1.5 million people. Zimbabwe has a population of 11.5 Africans and about 100,000 European settlers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is still strong resistance from Africans, especially chiefs and other traditional leaders, to cremation. They are still to be convinced that cremation is a good alternative to burial in view of the expanding number of deaths due to AIDS and the growing shortage of land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare City Council operates two cremators at Warren Hills Crematorium.  However, Mapuranga said there were plans to refurbish two others which have not been functioning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was fear that crematoriums in Harare would be unable to cope considering that at least 70 percent of deaths in the capital are AIDS related.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Concern for burial land was raised in 1994 when the cemeteries were filling up very fast,&quot; Mapuranga said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mapuranga said from Aug. 17, 1996 to February this year, 1,509 AIDS related deaths were recorded in Harare, making this the leading cause of death in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was followed by hypertension with 688 deaths, heart diseases 436, and road traffic accidents with 73 deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although there has been a tremendous increase in the number of deaths due to the AIDS pandemic, the Harare city council still has ample land for burials,&quot; Mapuranga said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABUJA, Nigeria (PANA) - Sierra Leone's First Lady called on the Organization of African Unity on Tuesday to set up an African Women's Committee on Peace within its secretariat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patricia Kabbah said such a committee would boost women's efforts in the search for peace on the continent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the committee would comprise women in the judiciary, diplomatic service and political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Women from such a roster would be called upon at any time to form a team of negotiators, conciliators or mediators to respond to crises and emergencies that accompany a threat to peace and stability,&quot; she told the meeting of the first ladies in the Nigerian capital, Abuja.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabbah also called for a secretariat for African First Ladies Peace Forum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said there should be &quot;an intensive training programme for women in conflict resolution and the maintenance of peace&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said African first ladies should network with their counterparts and women of influence outside Africa &quot;to create and develop a wider international forum for mobilizing global efforts in support of women's progress and peace in Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing her country, which is grappling with the lingering effects of a civil war, she said: &quot;The most direct and powerful method for achieving durable peace in Africa is to enhance the progress of women through increased access to education as well as increased social, economic and political empowerment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, addressing the meeting, Marcrine Mayanja, the coordinator O.A.U's Bureau for Refugees Division, urged the first ladies to support the organization's humanitarian fund in order to &quot;alleviate the suffering of our unfortunate brothers and sisters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Africa harboured some six million refugees and 20 million displaced persons, mainly women and children. The refugees are mainly from Angola, Liberia, Somalia, Sudan and recently from Zaire.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABUJA, Nigeria (PANA) - The head of the United Nations refugee agency said Tuesday that the on-going crises in Africa and other parts of the world required a decisive approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadako Ogata, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said the emphasis should &quot;move from crisis management to a comprehensive strategy of crisis prevention and resolution.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: &quot;Only then can peace and tranquillity be secured. Only then will there be an environment conducive to the full development of the rich potential of Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her message was to the first meeting of Africa First Ladies, taking place in Abuja, the Nigerian capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ogata said the long-term solutions to the refugee problem lay &quot;in the prevention of the immediate and root causes of armed conflict, persecution and violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said this method &quot;challenges the traditional approach of dealing only, primarily with the humanitarian consequence of conflict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Abuja conference is taking place against the background of an evolving humanitarian tragedy in the Great Lakes region, especially Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ogata said that of the 26 million people of concern, to the U.N. agency, the body provides protection and assistance to 5.6 millions refugees, two million returnees and 1.3 million internally displaced persons &quot;in Africa alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the steady rise in the number of refugees in Africa had &quot;strained the traditional African hospitality&quot; while producing signs of donor fatique from the international community.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABUJA, Nigeria (PANA) - A meeting of African First Ladies entered its second day Tuesday to chart a bigger role for women on the continent in dealing with conflicts and humanitarian issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three-day meeting in Abuja, Nigeria's Federal capital, is part of Africa's follow-up to the 1995 World Women's Conference held in Beijing, China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Topics being discussed include the refugee situation in Africa, health of displaced people, implications of conflicts as well as political and economic empowerment of women.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officially opening the meeting Monday, the Nigerian First Lady, Maryam Abacha, suggested the formation of women non-governmental organizations devoted to peace and humanitarian pursuit in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abacha, the initiator of the conference, said conflicts in Africa had cause much suffering to a vast number of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Destruction of lives, property and infrastructure are tragically the common feature of these conflicts, thus bringing about unbearable suffering in refugee camps for millions of our fellow Africans,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naming Liberia, Sierra Leone, Somalia and the Great Lakes area, especially Zaire, as areas of concern she said there seemed to be no end to the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As such, she said the meeting had became imperative as a rallying point for the mobilization of humanitarian assistance toward redressing the horrifying image and statistics from the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa harbors some six million refugees and almost 20 million displaced people, some 70 percent of whom are women and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, she said: &quot;Thousands of children have been recruited into fighting forces as soldiers, while nearly two million children have been killed in armed conflicts in the past ten years and three times that number seriously injured or permanently disabled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her counterpart from Senegal, Elizabeth Diouf, called for an end to this misery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghanaian First Lady, Nana Rawlings, said the objective of the conference was &quot;to create the necessary structure within the O.A.U.&quot; to facilitate the implementation of peace and humanitarian programs by the women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Organization of African Unity Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said that for Africa to remain relevant and effective in the world, it must address the challenges of peace in its broadest term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Africa is to refuse marginalization, there is no alternative but for our continent to assume its own responsibility and leadership in facing the challenges of peace,&quot; Salim said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pledged the organization's support for the initiative by the First Ladies, saying that &quot;the full potential of our women has yet to be utilized.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in his address, the Nigerian Head of State, Gen. Sani Abacha, blamed economic deprivation as a root cause of some conflict in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the &quot;hope and euphoria&quot; that marked the end of the cold war would appear to have vanished in light of increasing intra and inter-state conflicts especially in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is distressing that each day we are confronted with horrifying pictures of war, deaths and refugees. This hurts our pride as a people,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Director-General of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, Jacques Diouf, underscored the relationship between peace and sustainable development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to representatives of the O.A.U. and U.N. agencies, delegates from more than 20 countries attended the meeting's opening ceremony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These came from Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Chad Central African Republic, Cote d'Ivoire, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Togo and Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also present at the opening of the Abuja meeting was Liberia's Interim President, Ruth Perry, and the secretary-general of the Beijing Women's conference, Gertrude Mongela of Tanzania.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are here to put pressure on the minister of defence so that he may reintroduce at the National Assembly the bill on reorganizing the Congolese Armed Forces,&quot; one soldier said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not understand why the government has withdrawn the bill at a time when the National Assembly was preparing to discuss its adoption,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The soldiers brought traffic to a halt in a 300-meter radius from the Defence Ministry. Only vehicles carrying foreign troops stationed in the capital for a possible evacuation of their nationals from Zaire were allowed free movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noncommission officers and other ranks in the military retire after 20 years of active service. The bill proposes that be raised by an additional five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congolese television announced Monday that at the government's request, the assembly was to debate the bill which, if it adopted, should defuse growing tension within the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill provides for housing, transport and equipment benefits for soldiers, as well as extending the duration of military service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The army has been rocked by seven mutinies since October 1995. These have been related to demands for better living and service conditions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Africa and U.S. National Interests American Assembly March 13- 16, 1997</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PREFACE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 13, 1997, sixty-nine men and women representing government, business, academia, nongovernmental organizations, the law, international financial institutions, labor, the military, religion, and the media gathered at Arden House, Harriman, New York, for the Ninetieth American Assembly entitled &quot;Africa and U.S. National Interests.&quot; For three days the participants examined issues arising out of the African continent, how they affect U.S. national interests in the present and future, and what policy the United States should follow. This Assembly was designed as a prelude to the National Summit on Africa, which begins this year with regional meetings and culminates with major national events in 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This project is chaired by former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nation, Donald F. McHenry, now University Research Professor of Diplomacy &amp; International Affairs, School of Foreign Service, Georgetown University. It is directed by former Congressman Howard Wolpe, now at the Brookings Institution, who serves as special envoy for the Burundi peace negotiations on behalf of the president and secretary of state, and David C. Miller Jr., president of the Corporate Council on Africa and former ambassador to Zimbabwe and Tanzania under President Reagan. An expanded version of the background reading prepared by the co-directors with the assistance of David Gordon for the participants will be published as a monograph entitled Africa and U.S. National Interests.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Assembly, participants heard formal addresses by Benjamin A.  Gilman, Chair, House Committee on International Relations, U.S. House of Representatives, and General James L. Jamerson, Deputy Commander-in-Chief, United States European Command. There was also a panel discussion on U.S.  national interests and Africa, moderated by Don McHenry, which included Larry D. Bailey, Partner-in-Charge, Africa Desk, Coopers &amp; Lybrand L.L.P., Gay J.  McDougall, Executive Director, International Human Rights Law Group, Jeffrey Lang, Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, and Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson, IV, International Affairs Advisor, Headquarters U.S. European Command, as panelists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following their discussions, the participants issued this report on March 16, 1997. It contains both their findings and recommendations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The text of this report is available on The American Assembly's home page on the World Wide Web (http://www.columbia.edu/cu/amassembly/), along with information about the principal speakers at this Assembly, and about other Assembly programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We gratefully acknowledge major funding support for this program by Carnegie Corporation of New York, with important support of The Ford Foundation and additional contributions by the Rockefeller Foundation, International Paper, and Maurice Tempelsman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American Assembly takes no position on any subjects presented here for public discussion. In addition, it should be noted that the participants took part in this meeting as individuals and spoke for themselves rather than for the organizations and institutions with which they are affiliated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We would like to express special appreciation for the fine work of the discussion leaders and rapporteurs in helping to prepare the first draft of this report: Pauline Baker, Salih Booker, Herman J. Cohen, MacArthur DeShazer, David F. Gordon, and Cherri D. Waters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*****************************************************</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FINAL REPORT of the NINETIETH AMERICAN ASSEMBLY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the close of their discussions, the participants in the Ninetieth American Assembly, on &quot;Africa and U.S. National Interests,&quot; at Arden House, Harriman, New York, March 13-16, 1997, reviewed as a group the following statement. This statement represents general agreement; however, no one was asked to sign it. Furthermore, it should be understood that not everyone agreed with all of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the very moment that a new generation of Africans is embracing democratic values and market-based economic principles, presenting the United States with an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen mutually beneficial relationships with Africa, America is at risk of a self-defeating de facto retreat. The end of the cold war has radically reconfigured our world, producing a new series of foreign policy challenges and opportunities for the United States. This is particularly true in Africa. The United States must embrace a bold, new futurist vision of Africa, recognizing that its economic, security, and human rights issues are also our issues, and that their lack of resolution will pose a continuing threat to international peace and stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conventional wisdom about Africa is distinctly negative and remarkably persistent. Because war and famine provide far more dramatic television images than functioning economies and parliamentary debates, the images of Africa to which Americans are exposed are sharply skewed and discouraging.  Consequently, the continent continues to be seen by most Americans as an economic and political disaster zone, characterized by little more than high levels of poverty and political instability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this view of Africa is far more a testament to the limitations of American media coverage, coupled with the legacy of deep-seated cultural attitudes and stereotypes, than to the far more hopeful current reality of many African states. While some of Africa's largest countries are indeed mired in crisis -- most notably Zaire, Nigeria, and Sudan -- violent struggle and wars have given way to reconciliation and nation building in such places as South Africa, Mozambique, Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Namibia. While Africa remains the poorest continent in the world, with the world's highest rate of population growth, a number of African countries are reaping the fruits of new market-oriented institutions and policies. Indeed, in 1995 the aggregate economic growth rate for the 35 countries of sub-Saharan Africa that have implemented major economic reforms topped 5%. Significantly, U.S.  exports to Africa have been growing at over 20 percent per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The very tendency to generalize about Africa as if it were a single entity is symptomatic of the limited contact most Americans have with Africa. Indeed, it is difficult to grasp the immense size of the African land mass, a continent so large that the whole of China, the continental United States, Europe, Argentina, India, and New Zealand can be fit within its boundaries.  The truth is that Africa's fifty-four nations encompass an extraordinary range of cultural, political, and economic diversity. Moreover, in the post- cold war era, the African landscape is undergoing radical transformation -- with changes leading to more open societies and economies on the one end (e.g.  , Namibia, Benin, Tanzania, Mali, Ghana, and Uganda), or to conflict and instability on the other (e.g., Zaire, Liberia, Nigeria, Sudan, Somalia, and Burundi). It makes no more sense to speak of the independent countries of Africa as an undifferentiated single entity than it does to speak of a homogeneous &quot;Europe&quot; or &quot;Asia,&quot; and the challenge to the United States is to develop a differentiated approach to African nations that will be reflective of this real-world complexity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a period of unique opportunity for both America and Africa. We are now in a position to seize the opportunities provided by the emergence of new, democratically-elected African leadership committed to market economies, the establishment of the rule of law and civil society, the privatization of inefficient state industries, and popularly accountable government. These nascent changes, largely unforeseen a decade ago, are fragile and need to be supported. With the United States increasingly dependent for its own economic well-being on the expansion of world trade, the potential for significant growth in African export markets merits aggressive American economic engagement with the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The end of the cold war also requires a redefinition of American security interests. National security analysts are increasingly focused not on the threat of a nuclear attack, but on the threats arising from international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, drug trafficking, the spread of infectious diseases, and environmental degradation. All of these issues are transnational, and their resolution will require the effective cooperation no less of African countries than of other nations. In short, today the strategic, economic, and political interests of the United States demand an intensified and sustained engagement with Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the United States can adjust its policies in light of the changing strategic environment and the sweeping economic and political changes transforming the African continent, it is well-positioned to benefit from a broader engagement with Africa. The advantages the United States brings to its engagement with Africa are several and unique: its experience with pluralism and the heritage of racial and ethnic diversity, its espousal of democratic values, its commitment to human rights, and its technological and entrepreneurial strength. An expanded partnership with the African continent will be of significant mutual benefit to both Americans and Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paradoxically, notwithstanding these dramatic developments that present both opportunities and challenges, recent years have witnessed not the expansion of American engagement with Africa, but in effect a retreat from the continent. U.S. policy has been characterized by a dangerous sense of drift. Many embassies and consulates, United States Agency for International Development (USAID) missions, and United States Information Agency (USIA) offices have been closed or reduced to a token presence. Assistance levels have fallen to the point that the United States is becoming a minor player compared to other donors. It would be a tragedy if the end of the cold war and the emergence of new African governments that share U.S. values and economic principles were to be met by the withdrawal of the United States from Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An additional observation is in order. The multiplicity of private sector organizations that dominate our social and economic intercourse with the more developed world -- such as Europe and Japan -- is beginning to play the same role with the newly successful African countries. U.S. private investment exceeded bilateral development assistance by about $200 million in 1996 -- and this trend promises to accelerate over the next few years. Similarly, U.S.  private voluntary organizations (PVOs), churches, and technical assistance organizations are becoming important partners of African governments and civil society striving to build democratic institutions, strengthen the rule of law, and protect the human rights of their citizens. This American Assembly feels that the increasing and welcome presence of American non- governmental actors in Africa is all the more reason for the U.S. government to strengthen and deepen its engagement with the continent. The growing number of partnerships with Africa need to be supported, and greater coordination among them should be encouraged, to advance both U.S. and African interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ECONOMIC INTERESTS AND POLICY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In no realm is the potential for change in U.S.-Africa relations more pronounced than in the economic sphere. Where once American business thought of Africa as inhospitable, many leaders of the corporate community are now among the most enthusiastic proponents of expanded U.S. engagement with the continent because opportunities for mutual benefits are increasingly evident.  A growing number of African countries are offering attractive investment opportunities and favorable trade prospects. It is clearly in the U.S.  national interest to reinforce these gains as they create jobs for American citizens and profits for American investors, while promoting economic growth and prosperity in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. business community's growing interest stems from the positive changes taking place in Africa. Thirty-five African countries are implementing macro-economic policy reforms that enphasize private sector development. Aggregate growth rates for Africa in 1995 and 1996 averaged twice the rates of the previous decade and are projected by the World Bank to increase. Indeed, U.S. trade with the eleven countries of Southern Africa is roughly equal to U.S. trade with all fifteen republics of the former Soviet Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to sustain this forward movement, African nations and the United States have a shared interest in promoting continued economic growth and broad-based development. Given the small size of many African markets, these impressive growth figures will be even stronger and easier to sustain if African countries can achieve regional economic integration. This process is also central to deepening Africa's integration into the global economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Trade and Investment in Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States has an interest in promoting trade and investment with Africa in a manner that coincides with Africa's own interests. To do so:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The United States should promote private enterprise in Africa and business partnerships with local entrepreneurs, expand African access to U.S.  markets, and encourage the establishment of regulatory environments conducive to private investment, both local and foreign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The administration should examine all provisions of U.S. trade law that negatively impact growth and development in Africa, and in particular should exempt African countries from the provisions that restrict African textile exports to U.S. markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The United States should fully fund existing commitments to the International Development Association (IDA) and the newly reformed African Development Bank (ADB), and encourage the IDA to support directly private sector development (in the form of equity or quasi-equity) and through its capacity to provide guarantees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The administration should defend programs that facilitate private capital flows to Africa (through the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation), offer tax incentives to increase U.S. private investment, and explore more creative opportunities to provide financing that will encourage positive economic change and the development of local African entrepreneurship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The administration should initiate a major effort to engage the American agribusiness community in Africa through a combination of public sector and private sector activities, as this is a sector that can lead to growth, food security, and mutual benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The United States should assist African countries to take advantage of increased global trade through serious participation in the World Trade Organization, especially in such areas as the Information Technology Agreement, the Telecommunications Agreement, and the upcoming Financial Services negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sustainable Development and Growth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also in the interest of the United States to support broad-based and sustainable development to help insure that the benefits of growth and open markets are equitably shared and ecologically sound. This is equally important to promote stability and reduce societal pressures that could undermine economic and political progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The United States, recognizing Africa's significant progress in political and economic reform, should create an African Partnership Fund, earmarking $300 million for countries that demonstrate leadership in the consolidation of democratic institutions and in the implementation of market-oriented reforms. This fund would be in addition to the approximately $680 million in bilateral development assistance currently committed to Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The United States should remove legislative and regulatory restrictions on development aid to Africa to enable a more flexible response to the rapid transformations taking place in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* U.S. policies and assistance should continue to support realistic national development priorities as expressed by African countries, and the United States should coordinate its program with each country's strategy for addressing those priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The United States should work to improve the terms of the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) debt reduction proposals, by accelerating the time frame for the implementation of these proposals, and by insuring that the large number of African countries whose debt burden consigns them to a virtual &quot;debtor's prison&quot; will benefit from this initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The United States should enhance bilateral and multilateral programs to reduce poverty and strengthen those sectors crucial to human development in Africa (e.g., health and education). Such support should emphasize programs aimed at the empowerment of women, including access to credit as well as the right to inherit property; the promotion of rural development; and the support of micro-enterprise development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Since foreign aid remains a crucial tool for U.S. engagement with Africa, and USAID must retain a significant field-based capacity, the agency should continue to streamline its processes, reduce overhead levels, and otherwise increase efficiency,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regional Economic Integration</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The full realization of Africa's economic potential and Africa's integration into the global economy depends in part on progress in achieving regional economic integration. Many African markets are too small to achieve economies of scale. Small indigenous industries are arising as a result of current economic reforms. Expanded regional markets could offer African countries cheaper manufactured goods from neighboring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African leaders are increasingly committed to the ideal of economic integration, and new efforts are being undertaken in all regions of the continent. The tendency toward greater democracy has brought more policy flexibility and increased regional cooperation. The United States should continue to work closely with African governments and regional economic organizations, such as the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), to accelerate the process of integration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLITICAL INTERESTS AND POLICY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Real progress toward democracy has occurred in many countries (e.g., Benin, Botswana, Eritrea, Ghana, Mali, Namibia, and South Africa), all of which should be applauded for their achievements. However, this progress often remains fragile. In many other countries (e.g., Zambia, Burundi, Niger, and the Central African Republic), there has been backsliding, military coups, or persistent authoritarian regimes that resist the forces of change that are occurring globally. Therefore, two primary approaches are recommended for U.S.  policy to promote good governance, democracy, and human rights. The first relates to strategies for fostering open political systems. The second relates to policies toward the &quot;giants in crisis&quot; (Zaire, Nigeria, and Sudan).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratization and Good Governance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. support for democratization in Africa since 1990, through the programs of the USAID, USIA, and the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), has been of great value to the process of political change, especially in the important area of free and fair elections. The U.S. should continue to coordinate with other bilateral and multilateral donors in supporting the positive trend toward democratization on the continent through in-country policy dialogue and specific program activities. Such coordination emphasizes the universality of democratic principles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the democratic process in many African countries advances, U.S. programs should emphasize the building of capacity and competence of state institutions, such as legislative bodies, justice systems, the civil service, the police, and the military. T(t)he emphasis should be on limited and accountable government that has the capabilities and professionalism to deal with the critical issues of diversity and pluralism, the rule of law, the efficient provision of public services, the maintenance of order according to democratic practices that respect human rights, and the development of systems to prevent bribery and corruption. Militaries should be professionalized so that they are under the strict control of elected civilian governments and are loyal to constitutional order rather than to particular groups or factions in society. Building state capacity also includes creating the regulatory environment for economic growth and development under the rule of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the area of human rights, all African states have adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and associated covenants, and have ratified the International Labor Organization conventions on workers' rights. There is agreement within the international community on what constitutes human rights violations and how to measure them. Most of these principles have also been enshrined in the African Charter for Peoples and Human Rights. The United States should support African states in fulfilling their obligations under these international and regional agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An essential component of promoting democracy and human rights is the strengthening of African civil society. Particular attention should be directed toward the women's organizations; human rights groups; the media; independent research, advocacy, and policy institutions; and academic institutions. There are three critical approaches to strengthening civil society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* First, the United States should increase its activities with African governments to create an environment that is conducive to civil institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Second, the United States should continue to encourage linkages between U.S. civil institutions and their counterparts in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Third, the United States should direct increased resources to support African non-governmental organizations (NGOs) .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giants in Crisis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three large countries -- Nigeria, Zaire, and Sudan -- face serious crises that can repercussions far beyond their borders. We believe that a false choice has been presented for U.S. policy with respect to Nigeria and Sudan, namely that the United States must choose between isolation and engagement.  Instead, we believe that a three-pronged effective policy approach toward both countries must involve government-to-government dialogue, aid to democracy advocates and civil society, and the application of sanctions and other forms of pressure. There should be an integrated, nuanced, and flexible policy that is responsive to events on the ground. We also believe greater attention should be given to Nigeria, where there is still time for preventive diplomacy, and that regional efforts to bring peace to Sudan should be supported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With respect to Zaire, the largest failed state in Africa, U.S. policy should aim at encouraging an exit for the old regime and facilitating the emergence of a legitimate government, thereby decreasing violence and minimizing loss of life. The United States should be prepared to support international intervention, if necessary, in order to prevent large-scale human suffering and loss of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SECURITY ISSUES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent years, Africa has been the theater of some of the world's most persistent conflicts. A number of long-standing civil conflicts have been resolved since 1990, thanks to the vigorous diplomatic and military interventions of a variety of actors. The United States has contributed in various ways to many humanitarian and peacekeeping efforts. As most African countries transition to democratic political systems, the causes of violent conflict are diminishing. Nevertheless, some countries continue to be mired in corrupt and authoritarian regimes, and are deeply stressed. Instability in these countries threatens neighbors as well as prospects for development, and inevitably impacts resident U.S. citizens, property, and investments.  Preserving and enhancing security in Africa should therefore be a high priority for U.S. policy, in order to consolidate economic and political gains and to protect American interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preventive Diplomacy -- Often, the United States has been unprepared and unwilling to deal in a timely way with serious crises in Africa. The United States needs to emphasize preventive diplomacy as a central part of its policy. This involves 1) strengthening U.S. information collection capabilities; 2) strengthening U.S. ability to analyze the data collected; and, most critically, 3) strengthening U.S. political will to act. Preventive diplomacy saves lives, saves money, and reduces the need for military intervention. For example, roughly as much (approximately $700 million) was spent in Rwanda in the eighteen months following the genocidal violence in 1994, as was spent that year in total bilateral development assistance in sub- Saharan Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations -- The United Nations has been the primary actor in peacekeeping in Africa for more than three decades. To enable the organization to continue this role, which is highly cost-effective for the United States, the United States must take action to pay its arrears and assessments to the UN and to all agencies of the UN system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African Conflict Management Initiatives -- The Organization for African Unity (OAU) and several subregional groupings have taken significant initiatives in the area of conflict prevention, management, and resolution.  African leaders have demonstrated a growing political will to invest in conflict management activities with the cooperation of civil society, the United Nations, and other actors in the international community. The United States should continue to support such initiatives on a sustainable basis through the allocation of resources, the provision of technical assistance, and the encouragement of close UN support for African peacekeeping and conflict resolution initiatives. The United States should also increase its efforts to address the mounting crisis of internal displacement and the massive flow of refugees across state borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African Military Professionalism -- Stability and security in Africa will depend to a great extent on the professionalism and commitment to democracy of African military establishments. The most important effort t(T)he United States can make is to encourage civilian control of Africa's militaries. The United States is playing an important supporting role through the Expanded Military Education and Training (IMET) program to assist African officials charged with oversight of the military, and to facilitate dialogue between African military, civilian officials, and civil society organizations. The United States further supports the professionalization of African militaries through regular contacts between U.S. military personnel and their African counterparts, including national and regional joint training exercises, visits to U.S. military command, attendance at U.S. military schools, and U.S.  military visits to Africa (for humanitarian relief training). U.S. resources devoted to these activities should be restored from the present level of $ 10 million to levels existing prior to 1990, which were approximately $30 million. The overall cost of such activities is minimal compared to the cost of responding to conflicts that are often exacerbated by unprofessional armies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crisis Intervention Policy -- The United States should encourage African governments to discharge effectively the responsibilities of sovereignty in good governments and conflict management. When conflict prevention and management efforts are unsuccessful, major humanitarian crises can sometimes ensue. In such situations, a vigorous international response is appropriate.  This is especially true when such crises threaten to degenerate into genocide.  International interventions, military or otherwise, will rarely succeed without the forceful leadership of the United States in cooperation with the international community, most often within the context of the UN. The evolving African Conflict Response Initiative provides a mechanism through which the United States can recommit itself to the exercise of such leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Post-Conflict Reconstruction and Reconciliation -- African countries emerging from violent conflict face enormous challenges, such as demobilization, demining, infrastructure repair, and restoration of governmental functions. If reconstruction does not progress, conflict can easily return. The United States and the international community must play a role in post-conflict reconstruction. However, with the costs so substantial, it is difficult for the United States to contribute to these needs without drawing from resources previously allocated to, and needed and deserved by, stable countries that are performing well. The United States should seriously consider separate budgetary allocations for reconstruction of war-ravaged countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transnational Security Issues -- U.S. interests in curbing arms proliferation, drug trafficking, international criminal activities, terrorism, the spread of infectious disease, and environmental degradation are as significant in Africa as they are in the rest of the world. The United States should develop better sources of information and analysis on these problems as a basis for enhanced cooperation with African governments, the OAU, and subregional organizations in combating these threats to mutual security interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LEADERSHIP INITIATIVES TO REINVIGORATE AFRICA POLICY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recognition of Africa's dramatic political and economic transformation and of Africa's growing importance to U.S. national interests, this American Assembly calls for renewed and vigorous national leadership on U.S. - Africa relations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* President Clinton should travel to Africa to draw attention to Africa's political and economic renewal, and to engage Africa's leaders on issues of mutual concern, such as international trade, conflict prevention, and peacekeeping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The president should also invite selected African leaders to participate in a U.S.-Africa Partnership Summit to explore ways and means of strengthening U.S. economic and political linkages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The president should take the opportunity of his chairmanship of the G-7 Summit meeting in Denver in June 1997 to announce the creation of the African Partnership Fund as part of a comprehensive U.S. trade and investment initiative for Africa. In addition, the G-7 countries should be encouraged to take coordinated action to facilitate Africa's full and equitable participation in the global economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Government agencies responsible for trade and investment must mobilize to take advantage of Africa's dramatically improved economic environment In particular, the growing complexity of U.S.-Africa trade relations requires the appointment of an Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The National Security Council should be tasked to coordinate Africa- related policies, programs, and activities to ensure the effective implementation of new initiatives launched by the president. This coordinated undertaking should include, minimally, representatives from the Departments of State, Defense, Commerce, and the Treasury, as well as USAID and the U.S.  Trade Representative's Office. The goal should be the development of a truly holistic approach to the critical questions of U.S. Africa policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Congress must ensure that the State Department, USAID, and USIA all retain adequate resources and personnel to be effective. The Department of Defense is to be commended for restoring many of the defense attache positions lost in recent years, but the trend of closing diplomatic posts and sharply scaling back the number of countries in which the U.S. foreign aid program operates is damaging. Assembly participants are mindful of the crucial leadership role that Congress has played in changing the course of U.  S.-Africa relations at important junctures, e.g., the Comprehensive Anti- Apartheid Act of 1996. Reinvigorated Congressional interest and leadership on Africa now can and must make a real difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Finally, Congress must continue current levels of development funding for Africa, and should reduce programming restrictions to provide a more flexible instrument for responding to the dynamic changes in Africa. These programs are targeted at enhancing the capacity of Africa's low-income countries to promote broad-based, poverty-reducing, and private sector-led development strategies. In addition, Congress must lend its authority and financial support to the African Partnership Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recommending more vigorous and visible U.S. leadership for enhanced American engagement in Africa, the participants in this American Assembly have not lost sight of the ultimate responsibility that Africans themselves have in the shaping of their continent's future. With the best will in the world, the United States and other international partners cannot create development or democracy in Africa. Only Africans can make this happen. The good news is that new leadership, determined to bring about meaningful change, has emerged in a majority of African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All Americans have an interest in helping to ensure the success of these extraordinary reform efforts. The United States must send a clear message to those African countries that have embarked on serious political and economic transition that they can count on the sustained cooperation of the United States in a mutually beneficial partnership.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Nadine Gordimer's The Lying Days on the coffee table, coffee on the dining table, Louis Baum with his back to the world's best view of the back of Table Mountain. This is the man, briefly home from London, who went to the charity gala premiere of The English Patient with the man who wrote the book and co-wrote the screenplay - Michael Ondaatje.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Embarrassing, Louis says, for there were scenes where he wanted to weep, and how can you, sitting next to Michael?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Louis is the editor of The Bookseller, a splendid weekly magazine of the British book business that's been published since 1858. He was in South Africa recently with thoughts of setting up something similar here. He also thinks his Michael Ondaatje/English Patient links are too tenuous to talk about.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not at all. Louis' partner, Liz Calder, publishing director of Bloomsbury, is Michael's publisher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some years ago Liz mentioned to me that there was the possibility of her bidding for a new novel by Canadian novelist Ondaatje. I asked whether she'd read his In The Skin of a Lion, which she hadn't. So she did and that's the only rather tangential role that I had.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the most extraordinarily wonderful novel. It's never been made into a movie but there are scenes from it that are so powerful that I remember more clearly than I remember scenes from The English Patient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Michael was very involved in the movie - he was on the set, he worked closely with Anthony Minghella and he told me he was very happy with the film, even though it's not so much an adaptation of the book as a kind of interpretation, or homage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After Minghella read the novel, as I understand it, he shut it and never went back to it. He wrote the script from his recollection. To my mind that recollection is an extraordinary evocation of the book and it's very true to it in spirit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Louis has been patient, but his hands and his heart are now on The Bookseller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He finds it hard to believe that there isn't room for something similar in this country, even though the consumer book market is very small by international standards. He is bowled over by our local publishers. David Philip, he says, is an extraordinary publisher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you look at his catalogue ... it would be hard enough to run an equivalent list in a large market like Britain. To do it in Cape Town is extraordinary. He and Marie are internationally renowned - and with good reason. He's got Nadine Gordimer, Alan Paton, Ben Okri, Mike Nicol, Dan Jacobs, William Plomer - all the names.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local authors?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nadine Gordimer on the coffee table is Louis's second attempt at reading her. Now he's utterly hooked, which has mopped up a troubled teenage relationship with her writing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's been very embarrassing because Liz publishes Nadine in London, and I've met her on various occasions. Just last week I was with her in Johannesburg. She's not easy to read, nor is Michael Ondaatje, but once you get into those two you're in the hands of master storytellers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Louis grew up between Keetmanshoop and Windhoek, wanly setting out to board at SACS Junior School when he was nine. After UCT he joined the Cape Times, which sent him to London in 1974. There he stayed put:&quot;Tony Heard, my editor then, was very supportive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain, he says, has had to hastily realign itself with market changes - the growth of book chains, the mergers that have given life to the seven large publishing groups, the more than 100 000 new titles a year, and the huge technological changes to record it all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How do we fare here?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He takes a deep breath, and gives his sweet smile of complicity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My British friends aren't going to like to hear it, but the future has to see the growth of an indigenous publishing industry in this country. Your prices are dictated to a large extent by the fact the consumer book sector in South Africa is so dependent on imports from the UK that book prices are dictated by London prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This has to change for the sake of the South African consumer, for the sake of the health of the South African book business and for the sake of literacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's quite a way off, it's not going to happen overnight because the market is so small, but it's another reason why I want The Bookseller to be involved now. I think the future in South Africa is going to be incredibly exciting. And I'm going to be pleased that we have created links with this market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I also want us to do what we can in our small way to facilitate the change towards that future.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The National Party's Federal Council has decided that it would be inappropriate for the party's leaders to seek amnesty from the truth and reconciliation commission</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reasons advanced by the National Party's Federal Council for its decision that former President F W De Klerk and other leaders should not apply for amnesty from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission appear to be consistent with past statements by the NP leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their position has been that Mr De Klerk and others with responsibility for security in the previous government did not order or condone the illegal acts or the gross violations of human rights which have been exposed in TRC hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since amnesty can only be applied for by individuals in respect of specific misdeeds, they would have had to abandon their insistence on innocence in the process of seeking amnesty - clearly a tricky position for the party to find itself in.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the matter should not rest there. Mr De Klerk and his former colleagues in government undoubtedly do bear indirect political responsibility for what was done in the name of their former administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over many years they and their predecessors sought extraordinary security powers, devolved the execution of those powers to the former security services and created the political climate - including the contrived hysteria of the &quot;total onslaught&quot; - which lent a spurious justification to many misdeeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They failed, repeatedly, to take effective counter-measures when abuses were exposed and, as the TRC evidence has so chillingly revealed, they failed to properly control the powers exercised by others in their name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later this week the NP is to hold discussions with TRC chairman Desmond Tutu on possible alternatives to amnesty. Legal technicalities aside, the party should use this meeting to find a suitable means of declaring their remorse for the sins of the apartheid years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - An executive of a leading multinational says the Government's plans to impose a training levy on companies to upgrade workers' skills is not the best way to tackle low productivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tony Frost, an executive director of Lonrho's management services, told a conference of the International Confederation of Temporary Work Businesses (CIETT) that South African companies had a poor record of upgrading workers' skills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you look at the First World, countries use 4 to 8 percent of their Gross Domestic Product for skills upgrading, developing countries use 8 to 12 percent, and South Africa spends less than one percent,&quot; Mr Frost said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He suggested that the Government should rather follow the example of Malaysia and compel companies to pay a certain percentage of their profits towards upgrading the skills of their workers or be forced to pay the same amount to the revenue services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to invest in our people and it is the way to go. If we can increase the size of our skills base, it will increase our economy,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour Minister Tito Mboweni released a Green Paper on a skills development strategy two months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It proposed a system of grants to encourage businesses to reach targets at enterprise and industry level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grants would be financed by a levy of 1 percent to 1,5 percent of company payrolls, to be phased in over time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has criticised the plan saying the levy is too small.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the South African business sector has said it was mindful that skills needed to be upgraded, it has been very critical of the levy and called for other means to address the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Frost said the lack of skills among South African workers was also impacting on productivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our productivity has steadily been on the downslide for the past 20 years.  To improve it we must make sure that our people have the best skills and competency in the world. Bureaucracy which is one of the killers of productivity gains and creativity in Africa must also be done away with,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unless we join hands we will be in real trouble,&quot; Mr Frost said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The widow of one of the Cradock Four, Nomonde Calata, has expressed anger that the families of the victims had been forced to &quot;protect&quot; the killers after one had applied for amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The families had been warned not to talk about their meeting with former Port Elizabeth security police colonel Eric Taylor who is applying for amnesty for the murder of the four anti-apartheid activists in 1985.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am terribly angry, more angry now than I was before I met Colonel Taylor.  I hated every minute I was talking to him at the NG Kerk in Kabega Park on April 21,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What also angers me is being told that we should not talk about the meeting because we will be jeopardising the chances of the killers of my husband when they apply for amnesty,&quot; said Mrs Calata, widow of Fort Calata.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why must I now protect them? I do not care whether Colonel Taylor applies for amnesty. That does not concern us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Calata said it was strange to her that Colonel Taylor should want to meet the families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we are told that if we talk we will be jeopardising his chances, why did he call us - or was he calling us to hurt us more? I am not trained to keep something dirty like the killings of our husbands within my heart,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Calata said it had taken Colonel Taylor more than 11 years to come forward with details of the brutal murders of her husband, Mathew Goniwe, Sparrow Mkonto and Sicelo Mhlauli.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The anti-drug group Pagad has criticised the use of known Cape Flats drug dealers and gangsters to clear Cape Town's streets of crime in an attempt to help win the 2004 Olympics for the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People Against Gangsterism and Drugs was reacting to the announcement of a Community Olympic Forum plan in which gangsters were given the responsibility for curbing violence and lawlessness in a strategy dubbed the Olympic Peace Initiative.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement was reached with members of the Community Outreach Forum (Core), the organisation of gangsters who say they have reformed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the manifesto, the gangsters declared their willingness to act as &quot; protectors of communities&quot; who would rid the central city and Bo-Kaap area of criminal activity and clear street-child gangs from the area by May 14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the drug trade will not be dealt with by the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abdus-Salaam Ebrahim, chief co-ordinator of Pagad, said the organisation was not against the use of reformed gangsters to bring peace to communities, but it was totally unacceptable that &quot;known drug dealers&quot; were being recruited in this way.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - An acute shortage of low-income housing has been identified as Cape Town's most pressing problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major difficulties facing the city include R50-million owed in rental and rates on council-owned property, racially segregated waiting lists, massive overcrowding in hostels - which are housing thousands of families - and the limited amount of money available through the state housing subsidy scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City manager Andrew Boraine told the Cape Town Press Club recently that &quot; housing, housing, housing&quot; was the most serious problem with which Cape Town had to deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cape Town municipality is in the process of formulating a strategic development framework to address the housing crisis. Also in the pipeline is a new housing department which will begin to look at both the existing rental stock belonging to the council as well as new housing projects.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourteen key issues affecting housing delivery have been identified in a document which is to be tabled at a series of workshops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Ahmed Vawda, Cape Town municipality's new executive director of community development, the workshops will be an important step towards formulating a housing framework - something which both Durban and Johannesburg have already tackled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his view, the priorities are to identify the roles of responsibility of the various roleplayers - the province, the metropolitan council and municipalities - and to get agreement on common systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These agreements should cover issues such as the allocation criteria for new housing and the methodologies used in new housing projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other matters that have to be dealt with are transitional arrangements arising out of the inherited situation, and ensuring delivery of existing projects is not held up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the 14 key issues to be laid on the table at the workshops are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Cape Town municipality waiting lists, previously limited to coloured families, have about 44 000 names on them. There are two lists - the first, dating from 1968 to 1987, has 16 596 names on it, and the second, from 1988 to the present day, has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">29 097 names. As there is an average 12-year wait for a vacancy in rental schemes, the second list is not in use. There are also waiting lists for Ikapa and Crossroads, but the status of the lists and numbers is not known.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* There is an urgent need for public land to be made available for housing in the low-income market but a comprehensive data base of all vacant city land is still being prepared. There is no agreed policy for the release of land and there are competing uses, such as between housing, recreational and commercial uses. The cost of serviced land also takes up almost 70 percent of the available housing subsidy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Housing finance and affordability. One of the problems to have emerged out of the housing subsidy scheme is the inability of low-income earners to raise small loans to top up the available subsidy. This means there is little money left for the dwelling itself - most goes on the provision of services - because an estimated 75 percent of people in Cape Town earn less than R2 500 a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Subletting is widespread in council rental estates but the tenure of the tenants is insecure and they are open to exploitation. Overcrowding is also widespread. While there is a demand for rental accommodation, a national policy is not ready yet. There is also illegal renting of state land in squatter areas although this is being ironed out through the integrated Serviced Land Project, which is providing 34 000 serviced sites on a freehold title to beneficiaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Housing delivery in the Cape Town municipality is mainly confined to the integrated Serviced Land Project (iSLP) which is constrained by the limited amount of money left over for the actual houses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* There are an estimated 25 000 backyard shacks in the Cape Town municipality, and possibly 55 000 to 100 000 in the metropolitan area. These shacks do not meet building regulations and have not been approved by the local authority. They also lead to services and facilities overload. Planning needs to recognise that given the housing shortage, subletting and backyard shacks are inevitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In the Ikapa area, hostels provide on average one bed per family with consequent massive overcrowding, overloading of infrastructure, a breakdown in administration and no rental payments coming in. Upgrading will displace some families who will have to be accommodated elsewhere. An estimated 96 000 people share 22 000 bed spaces in public hostels, while a further</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">15 000 are accommodated in 3 360 beds in 54 private hostels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* While higher density affordable housing has been identified as desirable in planning terms, high construction costs do not make it affordable for the poor. The existing housing subsidy scheme means that higher density housing is affordable only for those earning above R3 500 a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The council administers and manages about 63 724 rental units which are plagued with arrears. Some people living in these houses are enjoying highly- subsidised rentals because they may be earning well above the income levels which would normally qualify them, but there are no up-to-date income assessments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Homeless people living on the streets of the city need to be catered for, whether through shelters, skills training or rehabilitation programmes.  Street people impact on business confidence in the city and often find themselves in conflict with permanent residents or businesses.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Glamour, glitz and upmarket shopping might be the hallmark of Cape Town's Waterfront, but there's another Waterfront in town which speaks volumes for the housing problems facing the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Waterfront is an informal settlement at the edge of Guguletu, sandwiched between Lansdowne Road, the railway line and a foul sewer canal - hence the name Waterfront - which serves as a general rubbish tip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It stands cheek-by-jowl with the neighbouring settlements of Polla Park and Fezeka.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 800 families live at the Waterfront, mostly in one-roomed shacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents have between them 15 toilets and there are an estimated 300 people to one water tap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conditions can best be described as squalid even though a handful of residents are making a brave attempt at decorating their shacks, whether with bright paint or a few potted plants .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are no services to speak of and certainly no recreational facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most rubbish seems to end up in the canal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shopping is limited to three spaza shops, and entertainment is laid on by the four shebeens in the settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preschool children whose mothers work may attend a creche in nearby Polla Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The risks of fire and the squalid conditions, including concrete-lined gutters which run through the settlement, are sufficient reason for residents to aspire to move out - possibly to one of the integrated Serviced Land Project's new developments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The integrated Serviced Land Project is the largest housing project in the country and currently Cape Town's only major housing initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Waterfront is not much more than two years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its residents consist mainly of overflow from the nearby Kiki hostels, with many women setting up home after attempting to join their husbands in Cape Town but finding that their husbands were already ensconced with another family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another major component of the Waterfront's population are young people from Guguletu who leave home and set up shacks on their own in a bid for freedom and independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there are the new arrivals from the former Transkei and Ciskei who have come to Cape Town to seek work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A committee of 15 is in place at the Waterfront to regulate community activities and will be pivotal in determining who is allocated housing should it become available elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, they're hoping for more toilets - but a wall which separates the settlement from the railway line has been cited as a barrier by the council, according to a local committee member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On any given day, the stench of raw sewerage hangs over the settlement and toddlers scrabble in the dirt outside their homes with little prospect of a patch of lawn or a swing to play on, let alone a real house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One is left to wonder whether the name - the Waterfront - is an expression of hope for better prospects or simply a name thought up by someone with a very wry sense of humour.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - More than 600 families are to benefit from the first development to have taken place in the once war-torn Crossroads, ravaged by conflict in the mid-1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The development of 604 sites in Phase 4 is part of the integrated Serviced Land Project (iSLP), the largest housing project in the country and currently Cape Town's only major housing initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Crossroads sites are due to be ready by September this year, and beneficiary families are to be given an education and information programme before they take occupation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local elections last year have been cited as a reason for &quot;peace breaking out&quot; in Crossroads as former warlord Jeffrey Nongwe was roundly beaten by African National Congress councillors at the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the integrated Serviced Land Project has come under fire from councillors in the Cape Town municipality who voted to have the project suspended recently on the grounds that the houses being delivered were not up to scratch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cape Town municipality is not, however, in charge of the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a presidential lead project with a budget allocation of R1,2-billion and it will provide 34 000 serviced sites to families, the bulk of whom earn less than R800 a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the problems which has beset the iSLP is that there is little money left over from the state subsidy to build a &quot;top structure&quot; - or actual house - with the bulk of the subsidy being spent on servicing the land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Municipal engineers maintain that high service standards are necessary to save on long-term maintenance costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another problem is that low income-earners cannot raise loans to supplement the subsidy. Thus the houses that are built are extremely small and in the &quot; matchbox&quot; mould.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, a strategy to upgrade informal settlements once their occupants have moved to new sites is being hampered by the fact that other people move in as soon as the former occupants move on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some informal settlements are also located on land which cannot be upgraded because of its poor quality, such as the 1 000 families who live in the settlements known as Barcelona and Europe on the old municipal rubbish dump alongside the N2 near the airport</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While politicians have been arguing over the iSLP, many residents have already moved into their new homes or on to the sites allocated to them for self-build schemes, indicating that those desperate for housing are willing to take what they can get.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbuyi Nombembe, a facilitator with the iSLP, feels that the way in which the houses are viewed depends on where people are coming from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those who have been living in unserviced squatter settlements such as Barcelona, Europe or the ironically named Waterfront, it is definitely a step up to live in a house which has water on tap, a flush toilet and electricity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The tourism industry has been hit by a war of words over where international delegates to a tourism indaba would prefer to be - Durban or Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durban is miffed because one of South Africa's tourism bosses has said the visitors to the conference in that city would prefer to be in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durban's pique surfaced as Indaba '97 opened yesterday at the Durban Exhibition Centre, attracting nearly 1 000 foreign delegates and journalists.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remarks by Reg Swarts, acting chief executive of Satour, which organises the hugely popular expo, have drawn criticism form Durban's metropolitan council and tourism promoters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with the Cape Argus, Mr Swarts said: &quot;All the international people would love to be at the Indaba in Cape Town, but you (Cape Town) just don't have the facility to accommodate all of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durban's marketing bosses are seething at the remark, which they said implied that Cape Town would be a better choice of venue than Durban for the country's top tourism and travel expo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Swarts also described the Western Cape as one of the &quot;icons&quot; of the show, because of its scenic beauty and newly discovered cultural opportunities such as Robben Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Durban already losing ground to Cape Town in the race to attract overseas visitors, the remarks have struck a raw nerve with city promoters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Metro council communications director Peter Bendheim said: &quot;If Mr Swarts has been quoted correctly, his comments are extremely unfortunate, coming from someone who is supposed to represent South African tourism as a whole, not individual cities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the foreign delegates he had spoken to were more than impressed with Durban and its conference facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even if Cape Town were to come up with better exhibition facilities, which is unlikely, given the fact that our International Convention Centre comes on line in August, Durban would still be the better venue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's South Africa's only truly African city. In Cape Town, delegates might as well be in Europe with a pretty mountain in the background.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tourism Durban declined a direct response, but privately, officials say the last time Cape Town hosted the Indaba in 1991, the &quot;shambles&quot; that ensued resulted in Durban's being awarded the show for the next six years running.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - ECA CHIEF CALLS ON AFRICA TO PURSUE &quot;MORE PURPOSEFUL ENGAGEMENT&quot; IN WORLD TRADE, UN SECRETARY GENERAL PRAISES ECA FOR INITIATIVE ON INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been a distinct change of attitude in Africa, an embrace rather than an avoidance of business and private sector development as well as the willingness of governments to create environment that allow investors and entrepreneurs to flourish, a senior UN official has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These promising trends -- including the emergence of a new generation of reform-minded leaders in many African countries -- &quot;are the reasons for much hope and optimism about Africa&quot;, said UN Under-Secretary General and ECA Executive Secretary K.Y. Amoako.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the opening ceremony of an ECA conference of African ministers responsible for economic and social development here Monday, Amoako added: &quot; To foster and nurture these positive trends requires perseverance and commitment. Nowhere is such perseverance and commitment needed more than in accelerating trade and investment&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Accelerating Trade and Investment in Africa' is the theme of the three-day conference, which brings together senior African experts and policymakers, including a number of ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amoako's point was bolstered by Kasu Ilala, Deputy Prime Minister of Ethiopia, who in his statement to the conference said that with the exception of a few countries &quot;the general economic situation in Africa in terms of growth domestic products (GDP) has, by and large, been improving since 1995&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His optimism notwithstanding, the ECA Executive Secretary stressed that Africa has steadily lost world export market shares for its principal exports which, in turn, have seen their relative importance in world trade decline -- from 6 per cent in 1980 to 2 per cent in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In regard to trade expansion, we must embark on a more dynamic course marked by increased participation in world trade and a more purposeful engagement in international exchange of resources&quot;, Amoako said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;In view of the weakening of traditional resources of development support, financing additional investment to spur vigorous growth and to reduce poverty in Africa is likely to emerge as one conspicuous challenge facing our continent&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few hours before Amoako spoke, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in a statement preceding the Addis Ababa world launch of its 'World Investment Directory in Africa' revealed that foreign direct investment (FDI) flows in Africa were moving into service industries, particularly into the finance and insurance sectors and manufacturing, leaving behind Africa's traditional concentration on primary commodities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, reported UNCTAD spokesman Jagdish Saigal, the liberalization of investment and trade regimes were spawning a new phenomenon: the emergence of African Transnational Corporations (TNCs) in countries such as South Africa, Morocco and Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African TNCs include: Anglo-American Industrial Corps (South Africa) the largest in the region; Barlow Rand Ltd., a conglomerate in South Africa; Conserverie Cherifinnes, a food TNC in Morocco ; and Zambia's Consolidated Copper Mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, compared with other parts of the world, overall volumes of FDI flows for Africa remain low. Between 1991 and 1995 Africa attracted only 5 per cent of total FDI flows to developing countries and 2 per cent of world's FDI. Moreover, FDI in Africa is concentrated only in a handful of countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria and Egypt accounted for over 50 per cent during the first half of the 1990s. Morocco was the largest recipient during the same period with average annual flows of US$0.5 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his address, Assistant Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity, Vijay S. Makhan, argued that due attention should be given to such parameters as sound policy and institutional frameworks particularly to regulatory environments, efficiency of the banking system, monetary regimes, incentive packages and infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of commodities, said African Development Bank (ADB) vice-president Ferhat Lounes, Africa has lost market shares in cocoa beans, coffee and timber (mainly to Asia) and in iron-ore and cotton (to Eastern Europe).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The loss in market share is attributable to lack of competitiveness at both price and non-price levels&quot;, he added, warning that it was the income- dimension attribute of global competition that worried him most: as global income grows, so does the demand for more sophisticated goods. The majority of African countries produce primary commodities which were progressively becoming unattractive in international markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a message read to the conference by Amoako, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan applauded the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) for prioritising the issue of information and communications technologies on the conference agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference sub-theme, relating to the African Information Society Initiative (AISI), is reflected in a collaborative effort between ECA and the Global Information Infrastructure Commission (GIIC) -- an international non- governmental organization of leaders from 40 of the world's foremost information and communications technology companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GIIC provides a framework for filling the gaps between the public and private sectors, between developing and developed countries and between diverse industry sectors from around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ECA and GIIC are holding a high-level symposium on private and public sector partnership in building the African Information Society, the basis of which is AISI, a framework for developing Africa's information and communications infrastructure signed by African ministers in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Symposium will be broadcast live in Africa in an M-NET production on Multichoice digital satellite television (DStv). The GIIC will release its &quot; Statement of Addis Ababa&quot; on 7 May, which its Africa regional director Dr.  Derrick Cogburn says will strongly support private and public partnerships in building the African information society. It will also propose a set of principles intended to guide the implementation of AISI plans for National Information and Communications Infrastructure (NICI) within each African country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accra (APS) - It is a fact, most high level peace negotiations hardly involve grass roots representatives. But traditional rulers particularly in Africa, a continent bedevilled by internal strife, can make a major contribution to conflict resolutions and peacemaking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Retired Lt-Gen. Arnold Quainoo might well be remembered for his role as one- time Commander of ECOMOG, the military wing of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) charged specifically to ensure peace in war-torn Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicknamed &quot;Buffalo Soldier&quot; for his tenacity and military acumen, he served his tenure during the heady days of the Liberian insurgence and was unit commander when ex-President Samuel Doe was arrested and killed by some factional forces led by Prince Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to that appointment, he had been General Officer Commanding military personnel in Ghana, the highest military position in the country, and also a member of the then ruling Provisional National Defence Council headed by Flt- Lt. Jerry John Rawlings, now President of Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since his retirement from the military in 1995, Lt-Gen. Quainoo has found it fitting enough to put the expertise acquired during his military career to good use. He has established a centre to develop peace initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have lived through an era and I feel I have an experience and skill to impart to society,&quot; Lt-Gen. Quainoo says with much enthusiasm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Centre for Conflict resolution (CENCOR), of which he is the Executive Director, is bent on promoting peace in Ghana, the African sub-region and within the international community through the search for viable means of ending violent conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt.Gen. Quainoo says &quot;the goal of CENCOR is to institutionalize and professionalize the work of preventive diplomacy, peacekeeping and peace building and other endeavours for social justice and international peace.&quot; The centre has been running training programmes for its targeted groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONCOR recently organised a workshop for traditional rulers in Kumasi, Ghana's second largest city. The 32 participants were given an insight into the different models of negotiation, mediation and arbitration and their role in the field of conflict resolution. The traditional rulers also shared experiences and reflections on matters they had helped to mediate in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt.Gen. Quainoo explains that traditional rulers were targeted because of the role they play or could play in conflict prevention and resolutions. &quot;The workshop was meant to sharpen their skills, make them share experiences and learn from each other on the numerous responses needed for the prevention and resolution of conflicts,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this West African country as obtains elsewhere in Africa, traditional rulers otherwise known as chiefs, wield a lot of power and their ability to broker peace is very paramount in their communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When an ethnic conflict broke out in the northern part of Ghana in 1995, resulting in the death of scores of people, the government braced up to confront the situation by setting up a committee headed by a chief to broker peace in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee's work eventually paid off as it was able to restore peace to the ravaged communities of the northern region where an unrelenting war was waging between some ethnic groups over the issue of who was supposed to be the overlord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The destruction, in terms of human loss and properties, have compelled many of Ghanaians to look further afield in order to halt the emerging canker and other chieftaincy disputes which abound among its 18 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is in this light that CENCOR sees chiefs as important collaborators in the search for peace, says Lt-Gen. Quainoo. He, however, dismisses the view that with the current constitutional arrangements, the powers of traditional rulers have lost much bite. &quot;They are still a force to be reckoned with even today,&quot; he says and adds that, &quot;their decisions carry a lot of weight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt-Gen. Quainoo maintains that the respect chiefs have, makes them automatic arbitrators in most cases except those that demand certain legal propensities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chiefs believe they need a supportive framework within which to operate.  This was given credence in a declaration they issued after their workshop in Kumasi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the traditional rulers, the institution of chieftaincy could be brought to bear much more effectively on the process of conflict prevention, management and resolution if adequate resources and other ancillary logistic support necessary for them to translate their immense potential into reality are enhanced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also requested that capacity building resources should be made widely available for them. Besides, they urged CENCOR to organise studies to analyze conflicts in Ghana, both actual and potential, with a view to drawing up an accurate and usable conflict map of Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were of the view that as a matter of urgency, action should be taken to establish a mechanism for Early Warning and Preventive Diplomacy throughout the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thing that stood out clearly from the workshop was the collaborative will of the chiefs to work together for social justice, peace and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have always believed that the destiny of the country lies in our hands hence the need for us to evolve programmes that would reconcile our people and also better their lot,&quot; says Nana Akuoko Sarpong of the Chieftaincy Secretariat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the era of colonialism and to date, chiefs have been symbols of unity and have helped in moving the country forward. They were also very instrumental in the granting of independence to the then Gold Coast, now Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We share a common desire to obtain the very best for our communities and nation,&quot; the chiefs stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lt-Gen Quainoo says the Kumasi Declaration is receiving serious attention and assures that subject to the availability of funds, much would be done to meet the aspirations of the traditional rulers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is convinced this is the beginning of a worthwhile process and a lot would be done to ensure that conflict prevention and resolution becomes a hallmark in Ghanaian socio-political standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should be able to build for ourselves and leave for posterity a truly national setting devoid of the perils of social conflict and pointless disharmony,&quot; he stresses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With this new initiative, most people are hopeful that a new sense of direction is dawning on Ghanaians to give peace its due in the scheme of things.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi (APS) - Following reports of mass killings of Rwandese Hutu refugees in camps near Kisangani, Zaire, the United Nations is caught up in an unprecedented row with rebel leader Laurent Kabila, who has dismissed UN accusations of atrocities against refugees as a smear campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leader of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo- Zaire (ADFL) claims UN agency bosses are buddies of embattled President Mobutu Sese Seko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it seems the atrocities against refugees have clouded the Zairean rebels' seizure of Kikwit, the last important town before Kinshasa. However as we went to press, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan commended ADFL leader Laurent Kabila for intervening in the Rwandan refugee crisis but cautioned him against setting a deadline for repatriation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast to his earlier critical stance on Kabila, Annan indicated in a statement issued at the United Nations last week that he was encouraged and pleased that the rebel leader had travelled to Kisangani last weekend to take personal charge of the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, French humanitarian agency Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has made perhaps the most practical suggestion regarding the tens of thousands of Rwandese refugees on Zairean territory who are currently facing death, disease and starvation as they move deeper into the forests west and south of the city of Kisangani in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a spokeswoman of the MSF in Paris, instead of United Nations agencies feverishly trying to airlift the refugees from Zaire to Rwanda, a third country - maybe Central African Republic - should be asked to host the refugees and be supported to ensure their security and well being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medicins Sans Frontieres says the basis for this proposal is that most of the Rwandese refugees are determined not to return to Rwanda which is the fundamental reason they have continued to flee while some two million of their compatriots decided to return home from Zaire in the past two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 500,000 returned last November after Tutsi Zairean rebels defeated the hard line Hutu elements in the refugee camps in Goma, eastern Zaire following the Banyamulenge uprising against the government of President Mobutu Sese Seko in late 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ephraim Kabaije, Rwandese Presidential advisor was very critical of the MSF proposal. He refuted the suggestion that the Rwandese refugees currently in Zaire are a hard core group who fear retribution if they should return to Rwanda. &quot;I can assure you most of those who committed the genocide are currently in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is wrong to say Rwanda does not want its people now in Zaire back home.  In fact I have personally visited the camps in Kasese and Byaro outside Kisangani to talk to the refugees and urge them to return to Rwanda. I did this at considerable risk to myself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabaije says he visited the makeshift camps across River Zaire before the attacks on their inhabitants in the third week of April by Zairean villagers and rebels which has scuttled some 50,000 refugees, many too ill or physically exhausted to undertake extremely demanding flight through the thick jungle west and south of Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That incident together with the reported seizure allegedly by Zairean rebels of 50 children receiving treatment at a feeding centre in Bukavu, eastern Zaire have given the Zairean rebels a bad name internationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan used these serious humanitarian failures by the rebels to wage an unprecedented attack on rebel chief Laurent Kabila who was 2,000 kilometres away in Goma when the attacks on the camps at Kasese and Byaro occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Kabila launched a tirade of his own on Kofi Annan and his Special Representative in the region, Mohammed Sahnoun. Speaking on the Swahili service of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Kabila said both men were &quot;great personal friends of Mobutu&quot; and suggested that the United Nations Secretary General was involved in a smear campaign against his ADFL rebel alliance movement. He insisted there were armed elements among the Hutu militants in the camps, saying the killing of Zairean civilians by these Hutu elements had precipitated the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American government spokesman Nicholas Burns subsequently joined the fray casting aspersions on Mr Kabila's past - saying a socialist revolutionary &quot;was suspect.&quot; And the British paper the Independent has suggested that Kabila may not be in control of the rebels and that there is a likelihood of international implosion of anarchy in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some African observers now detect a complex web of international intrigue to try and stop Kabila's rise to power as ADF rebels move closer to the final showdown against the forces of the incumbent President Mobutu Sese Seko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African critics still do not want to forget too quickly that Annan's former boss Dr. Boutros Boutros Ghali ordered the pull out from Rwanda of United Nations peacekeepers at the height of the genocide in April 1994 - a move, it is believed contributed to the current refugee crisis in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers say the point is -- the United Nations has a very low image rating among the Banyamulenge rebels as well as the Rwandese government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite Kabaije's claim that Rwanda would be very happy to receive back the tens of thousands of refugees currently stranded in Zaire, elements in Rwanda are worried by the level of insecurity in parts of Rwanda caused by the unprecedented return of refugees from Goma (last November) and Tanzania (last December).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed even as we went to press, Rwanda security sources announced the massacre of 17 schoolgirls and their headteacher, a nun, in Gisenyi, by people the government describes as &quot;militants&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are indeed serious ethnic tensions in Rwanda blamed on &quot;militants&quot; among the refugees, who were allowed to return straight into their communes through the Rwanda government's policy of welcoming back refugees with open arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further internal tensions in Rwanda are the results of some 90,000 incarcerated in inhuman conditions in jails since the genocide three years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Laurent Kabila, he seems unperturbed by the vicious campaign against him that is spearheaded by the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is clearly pleased by reports from his commanders that Kikwit, 400 kilometres from Kinshasa, has fallen to his rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces without a fight from Mobutu's forces who have promised to fight to the last man in the battle for Kinshasa, Mobutu's last stronghold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kikwit in Bandundu is the major supplier of foodstuff for Kinshasa's 3-4 million people. Predictions are soon prices of available commodities will rise beyond the average person's purchasing power and an exodus from the city will start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila has predicted Kinshasa will fall to his forces by June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Richardson, the United States of America ambassador to the United Nations is already in Kinshasa and will subsequently see Kabila in Goma or Kisangani as part of America's initiatives to broker a peace- ful resolution to the seven-month old conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richardson, a staunch Catholic who told a recent Breakfast Prayer meeting in Washington of the power of prayer in his work, may perhaps succeed in convincing Mobutu to relinquish power in a peaceful way, without necessarily having to travel to Gabon or South Africa to negotiate his own exit from the Zairean political scene after 32 years in power.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi (APS) - Mzee Lesayon Lungungwani, in his 60s, was a wealthy man by average standards. He owned 30 camels, 56 cattle, 240 goats and 15 donkeys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a pastoralist, this was indeed a great achievement. But misfortune has no respect for age or social status. He lost all the animals except one camel and 10 goats to Rendille raiders who invaded Baragoi, north-western Kenya last February. Today, he is a watchman (guard) at Baragoi shopping centre, earning a weekly wage of Kshs 100 ( under 2 US dollars), barely enough to cater for his family of six.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, a kind neighbour gave him a calf which he is nurturing in the best way possible. &quot;I know God will provide; I will get others,&quot; he says quietly, pondering over the incident that has deprived him, making him dependent. However, he adds &quot;I am lucky because I only lost the animals. My friend was killed in the attack. They also took all his animals.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baragoi is in arid Samburu district in Northern Kenya where pastoralism is the people's mainstay. Pastoralists depend entirely on livestock and when misfortunes such as the one that befell Lungungwani strike a family the entire community is threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, during drought or when there is a disease outbreak, most families live on the brink of disaster. It is for this reason that ways and means are being sought to secure the future of such communities whose livelihood is so fragile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since livestock is such an important aspect of these communities' culture and economy, animal health is key to their survival and everything must be done to protect the livestock otherwise their lives are in jeopardy,&quot; says a veterinary officer Dr. Jacob Wanyama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was with this in mind that the workshop was organized under the auspices of a non-governmental organization working in the area, with the aim of bringing together traditional healers from Turkana and Samburu communities to discuss and exchange views on traditional healing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enthnoveterinary Knowledge (EVK) is a people's accumulated knowledge over the years about treating animal diseases. It covers areas of identifying disease nomenclature, symptoms, pathology, treatment and prevention. This knowledge is orally passed on from generation to generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EVK is gaining wider recognition not only because it has been used by communities throughout centuries but also because even with the introduction of modern veterinary practices, the majority of people cannot afford these services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of Samburu and Turkana pastoralists of Northern Kenya, the effects of economic structural policies have been adverse. Government extension services have been severed or minimized with the result that pastoralists do not have alternatives. The fact that they are constantly on the move does not make their situation any better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The role of EVK in complementing modern approaches to the control of livestock diseases in developing countries is gaining recognition from development and research institutions,&quot; Dr Wanyama observes adding that &quot;...  this is because modern veterinary services have become either too difficult to obtain or too expensive to afford.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The pastoralists have a reservoir of knowledge on the use of a large variety of medicinal plants and there is significant agreement on symptoms of diseases and their conditions,&quot; the doctor observes. He explains that such was the reason that led to a detailed investigation into these practices in order to identify useful ones that could be promoted instead of unnecessarily replacing them with the conventional ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This view is supported by the livestock officer in the division, Mr. Simon Belewa. He observes that traditional practices should be encouraged to supplement modern drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In remote areas such as Samburu, the situation is made worse by the fact that government veterinary services are not easily available. &quot;Even if they were, the extra expense of buying modern veterinary drugs is a burden to most families, therefore many of them rely on the traditional methods of treatment, &quot; notes the livestock officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as it was observed at the workshop in Baragoi, the traditional knowledge is slowly fading and disappearing with the older generation and may soon be extinct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mzee Lengungwani, for example, laments the death of his friend more because of &quot;what information he died with. Nobody will ever know how much he had,&quot; he says sadly. He adds that it is important to encourage the younger generation to pick up such information for the benefit of future generations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A traditional healer Alice Loriot appeals to &quot;...all those good people who are encouraging this work to go on.&quot; She observes that although traditional treatments are effective, they are often shunned by some people who would rather let their animals die than utilize such services. &quot;Yet modern medicine is very expensive....sometimes you have to sell up to three goats to treat one! And they don't always get healed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another medicine man Mr Albert Leleshep, who is also a chief in South Horr appealed to NGOs working in the area to liaise with other development agencies and government to conduct research so that they can improve the present traditional herbs and medicines for the people's use. &quot;This will reduce the expenses that most people incur when using modern medicines to treat their livestock,&quot; he argues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants at the mid-February workshop, comprising a cross-section of men and women from Samburu and Turkana, made several recommendations. They urged NGOs,government extension workers and other development agencies working in the area to encourage participatory and interactive processes which will facilitate information sharing on traditional treatment between groups in the district and beyond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were also concerned that similar information be promoted through schools to encourage passing on the knowledge to the younger generation. The effectiveness of traditional treatment currently being used should be tested for efficacy, they urged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During one session that involved boys from Baragoi High School, healers explained to students the different plants/herbs that are used for different diseases and students were encouraged to ask questions about the herbs. Later, all the plants that had been brought to the workshop by the healers were handed over to the school to start a herbarium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many of us who are your parents are 'blind'. No one knows about all the knowledge that we have, because we cannot write it down,&quot; Mzee Lengungwani told the boys. He passionately appealed to them to continue their interest in traditional medicines so &quot;that one among you can pick up this important work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The school currently runs an EVK club under the patronage of Mr. Munyi who enthusiastically notes: &quot;The club is relatively young but we would like to make an impact and be an example to other schools around. We would like to display something related to EVK at the forthcoming National Science Congress.  &quot; The congress is scheduled for this month. The club also plans to start a newsletter on EVK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EVK work in Samburu aims at integrating the ethnoveterinary knowledge into community-based animal health programmes by validating and improving on effective remedies together with Samburu and Turkana traditional healers.  Diseases and remedies to be investigated will be selected by the herders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other activities will include developing training manuals for community- based animal health projects in the area, liaising with relevant research institutions to investigate the efficacy of various identified EVK treatment and documenting and disseminating the results and experiences to interested parties. A set of two books is in the process of publication to exemplify the work so far done.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bujumbura (APS) - The Burundian army claims that Hutu rebels have massacred more than 40 people during a raid on a Roman Catholic seminary at Buta in the south of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An army spokesman told the independent Ijambo Radio that the rebels killed 34 pupils and seven lay members of the seminary in the attack on the seminary on April 29.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another 34 seminarians were seriously wounded, the army spokesman said, adding that the Tutsi-dominated Burundian army had killed almost 300 Hutu rebels in far southern Makamba province since the outbreak of fighting in the region on April 4.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebel attack is the second such massacre reported by the army in two weeks in the Makamba province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 18, military spokesman Colonel Isaie Nibizi said that the army had discovered the bodies of about 100 civilians massacred by Hutu extremist rebels in the southern province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colonel Nibizi said the slaughter took place in the Kayogolo zone of the Vugizo district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our troops found the bodies of about 100 civilians. The rebels called them out and killed them,&quot; Nibizi stated, after saying that rebels were continuing to infiltrate the extreme south of Burundi, at Kabonga and Nyanza-Lac, from Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same day, Makanda provincial governor Gilbert Manirambona told Radio Burundi that heavy fighting was taking place in Vugizo and that hundreds of people had been displaced and hundreds of houses razed to the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 1,000 displaced people were living in a church in Makamba town, the provincial capital, Manirambona added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF - Doctors without Borders) said some 1,000 other people had fled the fighting and taken shelter in Mabanda district, Ijambo Radio also reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A week earlier, the Defence Ministry had also said that 140 Hutu rebels and three soldiers in the government army had been killed in battles in Makamba province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition Hutu National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD), which has an armed wing, denied this claim and said the 140 dead &quot;rebels&quot; were civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attacks come less than two weeks since Burundi's strongman Pierre Buyoya expressed regret that regional leaders had long imposed crippling sanctions on his country but had no &quot;recipe&quot; to end its ethnic civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On returning from a regional summit on the crisis held in Tanzania on April 16, Major Buyoya told a press conference on April 17 that &quot;our friends in the region, our friends in the international community, want peace in Burundi, but we also note that the heads of state, the mediator and others have no recipe to bring peace. This is a clear indication that peace in Burundi is our business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The more than three year-old civil war pitting guerrillas from the Hutu majority against the minority Tutsi-dominated army has cost more than 150,000 lives, many of them peasants massacred by both sides. Tanzanian former president and elder statesman Julius Nyerere stepped in as mediator.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arusha, Tanzania (APS) - East Africa has taken a major step towards integration following a recent move by the presidents of the three-member states of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda to launch a development plan that would draw them closer through to the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a ceremony held at this northern Tanzanian town's Sheikh Abeid Karume Memorial Stadium on April 29, President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania and Yoweri Museveni of Uganda launched a common internal passport to be used by the three countries' estimated 80 million population for their day-to-day inter-state activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also inaugurated a flag for the region's economic grouping -- the East African Cooperation -- which was established by the three countries in March last year to replace the former East African Community which collapsed in 1977 due to ideological differences between the three partners.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a communique, the three presidents noted progress in harmonising fiscal and monetary policies, the introduction of convertibility of the three countries' Shillings currencies, and regular consultations among central bank governors and heads of revenue authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other moves also included formation of an East African Business Council and an East African Law Society, mechanisms to enhance cross-border trade, and removal of unnecessary police road blocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders also noted preparations for the start of a 69-million-dollar digital telecommunications project which is being undertaken with assistance from the European Investment Bank and the East African Development Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The communique reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening and deepening cooperation for equitable development in their three states and stressed the need to ensure environmental preservation, women's rights, peace and stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three presidents reasserted their commitment to creating a single East African market, stressing the role of the private sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moi, who is chairman of the grouping noted the recent reduction by the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation of its regional tariffs by 62 per cent and appealed to the international community to assist the new regional grouping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Museveni himself hailed measures to harmonize tax rates in the three states, saying that discrepancies encouraged smuggling, and also stressed the need for implementation of an integrated roads project and common standards on human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mkapa, on his part, hailed the development strategy plan as a new mechanism for balanced development in the region, stressing the effects on peace, stability and trust of stronger political, economic and social links among the people of the countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The communique did not, however, mention an application by Rwanda to join the grouping, although the Tanzanian Foreign Ministry officials had said on April 28 that it might be added to the presidents' April 29 summit agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the move was strongly supported by former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere who had said earlier that it &quot;would be good for Rwanda, good for East Africa,and good for Africa generally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyerere had also said that he was certain that neighbouring Burundi would also apply to join once it had a legitimate government capable of speaking and acting on behalf of its people -- a reference to the bloodless military coup in Bujumbura on July 25 last year, bringing back Tutsi strongman Pierre Buyoya to power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both countries are former Belgian protectorates with economies shattered by ethnic strife, though Rwanda's is fast recovering.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi (APS) - The Presbyterian Church of East Africa (PCEA) is calling for facilitative constitutional reforms in Kenya before general elections slated for late 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a press statement dated April 26, 1997, and signed by PCEA's Secretary General Rev. Patrick Rukenya, 600 elders and ministers of the church said they were concerned about the widespread corruption, immorality violent crimes and general insecurity in Kenya and the anxiety of the coming general elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The church leaders who met at St. Andrews Church here from April 22 to 26 for the 15th General Assembly of the PCEA, said without a constitution with checks and balances, there exists abuse of power and lawlessness which may lead to anarchy and disintegration of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Constitution is the supreme law of the land from which the three arms of the Government draw their exclusive authority for check and balance of each other,&quot; noted the church leaders.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They called on the government to immediately put in motion the necessary facilitative process for fair and free peaceful democratic reforms before the general elections. The current constitution does not allow a form of governance that addresses these issues effectively, they added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders further called for urgency in creation of an impartial Electoral Commission which can be acceptable to all political parties, churches, religious organizations, civic organizations and other sectors of the society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the public, the opposition and civic bodies have often criticized the current Electoral Commission, saying it plays partisan, favouring the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They however called for fair and free access to the public electronic media so that all views from a truly representative cross section of Kenyans can be heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya's public electronic media have since the advent of the multiparty system (1992) come under criticism for their bias towards the ruling party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PCEA statement called for the repealing of the Public Order Act, Chief's Authority Act and other discriminating and oppressive laws in order to create a conducive climate for peaceful and democratic elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to the book of Hosea 4:6, the PCEA leaders called on all their presbyteries to embark on civic education, prayer meetings and Bible study, &quot; so that our people may not be destroyed by lack of knowledge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newly installed PCEA Moderator Dr. Jesse Macharia Kamau said in an interview with APS that his church had sent representatives to the recently concluded convention for constitutional reforms held in Limuru, Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the church has a strong belief that people should always feel free to discuss issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aimed to force the government to agree on constitutional reforms, the early April convention was attended by leading churches, civic bodies, non governmental organizations and opposition parties. The government has shown little interest in the convention and its objectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, the Catholic Church Justice and Peace Commission on April 19 said Kenya risks sliding into anarchy if the constitutional reforms outlined by the Limuru convention were not put in place before the general elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not need to wait for anarchy before these reforms are effected,&quot; stated the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, the National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) on April 11 also expressed concern over what they called dismal performance of the current parliament in pushing for constitutional reforms and warned that time was running out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NCCK General Secretary Rev. Mutava Musyimi told a press conference in Nairobi that there have been promises of reforms by the government but upto date, there are no drafts of Bills to show that anything is being or has been done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere, the opposition Democratic Party of Kenya (DP) Secretary General Mr. Joseph Munyao said the Limuru convention organisers and participants are awaiting reaction from the President and the government on the resolutions forwarded to them about their deliberations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khartoum (APS) - Vigilant Christians continue to garrison their church in the Kalakala Gubba area of southern Khartoum following clear signs that state police and Muslim extremists intend to demolish it in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missionary sources told APS that on April 2 at approximately mid-day, a lorry full of police came to the parish centre at Kalakala Gubba and sealed off the whole area. The police and extremists then proceeded to mark the walls of the parish with large &quot;X&quot; signs, denoting the buildings were for destruction. However, forewarned, many Christians turned up and garrisoned the church thus foiling the intended knockdown.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fears by Christians in southern Khartoum followed the bulldozing of a small church in the village of Terenyaa on March 31. The 96 square metre church was constructed with steel and bricks. A government bulldozer from the Ministry of Planning and Works was used to demolish it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Missionary sources said the church was demolished without prior notice and without giving some time to remove benches, and a wardrobe containing vestments of the priests. It is not clear if the Blessed Sacrament was desecrated in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Christian present on the spot by chance, courageously jumped on the bulldozer to ask the reason for the destruction from the driver. &quot;Some angry Christian women threw stones at the bulldozer but to no avail. They were arrested and later released by police,&quot; said the eyewitness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 1 Archbishop Joseph Erwin Ender, the Apostolic Pronuncio, along with a large group of clergy and Christians organized Mass within the rubble of the demolished structure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of European ambassadors have also visited the demolished church to register their solidarity with the Christians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government paper Alwan later accused the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) of distorting public opinion charging that the incident did not occur.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG (APS) - A man who helped journalist Donald Woods escape from South Africa in 1977 has been granted amnesty by South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), the commission announced on April 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two other people were also granted amnesty, one for the illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition, the other for malicious damage of property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald Card, former mayor of the south coast city of East London, the truth body said in a statement, was granted amnesty for two offences he committed in helping in the escape of Woods, friend of black consciousness leader Steve Biko whose story was told in Richard Attenborough's movie, Cry Freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Card, 68, said in his application to the Truth Commission that he had assisted in the escape because he disagreed with the former apartheid government's banning of Woods under the Suppression of Communism Act.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the ban, Woods' movements were severely restricted and he was effectively prevented from carrying out his functions as editor of East London's Daily Dispatch newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two members of President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC), Thami Robert Ntshobane and Simon Orapeng Ntsitsi, were also granted amnesty by the Truth Commission, which is probing human rights abuses during the apartheid era, and which under certain circumstances, may grant amnesty to perpetrators who make full confessions and show a political motive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ntshobane, 23, was convicted in 1992 of being in possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition in Guguletu black township outside Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ntsitsi, 35, was convicted on four counts of malicious damage to property after four vehicles were damaged during a protest march in Kanana township outside Orkney, in North-West province, in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amnesty came only a day after Mandela had called on those guilty of human rights abuses during 40 years of apartheid to come forward and confess their misdeeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an address on April 27, marking the third anniversary of South Africa's first all-party elections, Mandela urged the culprits to speak to the TRC, charged with investigating decades of inhuman treatment, and said: &quot;We are encouraged at the growing numbers willing to help the commission uncover the truth about human rights abuses, and hope that their example will be followed by many more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on &quot;freedom day&quot; in the agricultural town of Upington in Northern cape, Mandela's words echoed a similar appeal he made on April 26 to South African Defence Forces, few of whom have so far presented themselves before the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Candidates, hoping for amnesty, which the commission will grant in some circumstances to those who confess taking part in as yet unsolved crimes, have less than two weeks to declare themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By April 15, the date which marked the first anniversary of the TRC, some 6, 000 candidates had come forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The work of the TRC has shown us, beyond what anyone could have foreseen, the power of the truth to heal,&quot; Mandela was quoted by South Africa's SAPA news agency as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mandela, the best recompense for victims of the apartheid era is &quot;our success in building a new society&quot; freed from the burden of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turning to the new constitution, which came into effect last January, Mandela declared it had &quot;strengthened our unity, both in the democratic manner it was written in and in the hopes it embodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our deepest aspirations are enshrined now in the basic law of our land,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A programme of festivities and political speeches took place throughout the country on April 27 and 28 to mark three years of multi-racial democracy under Mandela's ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the face of the ANC's widespread influence, following the departure of Frederik de Klerk's National Party, the country lacks a convincing opposition and it also lacks a powerful successor to the 78-year-old president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela's mandate runs out in December and he has indicated he will not be seeking a second term, sparking intensive jostling between the ANC's various wings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mandela can take satisfaction from a successful transition from a minority white government to a democracy and one of the most liberal constitutions in the world, the country faces intractable problems such as unemployment and crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Far from being conquered, rape, theft and all manner of trafficking steal the headlines day after day, particularly in Gauteng province, which includes Johannesburg and Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also growing discontent over reform -- seen as too slow by blacks, destructive by whites and unfair by coloureds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi (APS) - Churches and religious organizations have been urged to mobilize material and spiritual resources in order to alleviate the sufferings of the Rwandese refugees caught up in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent media reports have focussed on the destitution of tens of thousands of Rwandese (Hutu) refugees at the mercy of disease, starvation, death and other difficulties as the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) led by Laurent Kabila advance to wrest from President Mobutu Sese Seko the remaining stronghold, Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued at the end of a five-day meeting of the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) International Affairs Board, Refugee and Emergency Committee here, the continental body called on all political parties involved in the Zairean crisis to engage in urgent constructive dialogue for the restoration of durable peace and security in the Great Lakes region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Denouncing recently reported massacres of Rwandan and Burundian refugees in Zaire, the AACC urged leaders in the Great Lakes region and the international community to immediately take all the necessary peaceful measures to put an end to this new genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 35 participants, drawn from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Togo, Nigeria, Senegal, Zaire, Burundi, Cameroon, Kenya, Sudan, Liberia and Congo, also denounced what they called a &quot;slow and inadequate attention of the African leaders and the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This kind of slow and inadequate attention is increasing the death toll of men, women, young people and children on a daily basis, for lack of food, medicine and protection,&quot; the AACC said in the statement entitled, The Plight of Rwandan and Burundian Refugees in Eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement, signed by the organization's General Secretary Rev. Jose Chipenda and the chairman of its Continental Committee on Refugee and Emergencies Rev. Dr. Silas Ncozana, reminded all internal parties as well as the international community that the victims of this tragic situation are human beings, created in the image of God, whose lives must be preserved by all peaceful means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the issuing of the statement, delegates reviewed the refugee situation in Africa. They also agreed that the absence of peace, justice and reconciliation has contributed greatly to the multifacet problems facing the refugees and other displaced people on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the delegates at the AACC meeting also registered their concern about the current political upheavals resulting from the more than 13-year- old civil war pitting the Islamic Khartoum government against the rebels in the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AACC urged the church in the Sudan to continue to hold the Sudanese together, and more so during the current political crisis which they said was responsible for both the starvation and displacement of thousands of people in the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos (APS) - The Lagos State University (LASU) has been closed temporarily following clashes in which two students were killed and about a dozen others injured, Lagos-based African Independent Television reported here on April 29.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clashes occurred on April 24 between members of two rival campus cults during a contest to choose the university's Miss LASU, the private TV station said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authorities decided to close the university for three weeks after the violence, during which a number of people had been arrested and would appear in court soon, the police said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campus secret cults, whose origins date back to the 1950s, have in the past 10 years turned into gangs which kill, maim and rape on Nigerian university campuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first campus secret cult, the Pyrates Confraternity, was formed by the 1986 Nobel literature laureate Wole Soyinka and was aimed at peacefully correcting campus social ills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But other cults which followed swiftly resorted to gratuitous violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LASU, one of the youngest and most populous universities in Nigeria, has been closed several times in the past six years because of student unrest or due to teachers' strikes over conditions and funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All universities in Nigeria are owned and funded by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The students' violence comes amid continuing inter-ethnic clashes in Nigeria's southern Delta state in the past one month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday April 28, at least five people were killed and two villages torched in new inter-ethnic clashes in the state's two villages of Ebrohimi and Omadina, according to eyewitnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two villages are both dominated by the Itsekiri ethnic group, which has been clashing for the past month with Ijaws in Nigeria's oil belt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ethnic unrest has forced the Anglo-Dutch Shell oil group to close down some of its facilities, resulting in production shortfalls of more than 20 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least five Itsekiris were killed in Omadina, whose village leader Sunday Kake was abducted by Ijaw attackers, while the casualty toll from the attack in Ebrohimi was unknown, the witnesses said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omadina is near Warri, a key oil city of the Niger delta where clashes broke out in mid-March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearby Koko was the scene last week of violent clashes between the two groups, during which more than 80 people have died, forcing the Nigerian military authorities to order the army to intervene there the previous week in an attempt to stem the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The turmoil was sparked when Nigerian authorities decided to relocate the headquarters of the Warri municipality -- and the concomitant government funding -- from an Ijaw town to an Itsekiri area.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi (APS) - African churches have been called to give hope to their continent whose resources have been heavily plundered during the colonial and post-independence periods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meeting at Karen, near here from April 21 to 25, some 15 African theologians from Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, South Africa and Cameroon, offered one consolation -- that despite this heavy exploitation and plundering of the resources, the Africans are full of hope for a brighter future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theologians, whose subject of discussion was, The Role of Churches in the Reconstruction of Africa, reminded fellow scholars of their responsibility to lead the process of social reconstruction.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And they also reminded churches, which they stressed have direct contact with ordinary people in rural and urban areas, of their capacity and central role in raising hope and encouraging Africans as they enter the 21st century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theologians were also concerned about the way some sections of the mass media had portrayed the continent. &quot;Although Africa continues being portrayed negatively in the mass media, the continent has great potential as an integral and indispensable part of the global community,&quot; the scholars said in a communique issued at the end of their meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also urged the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) to facilitate networking between groups involved in the social reconstruction of the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also recommended that the ecumenical body should encourage national councils of churches (NCCs) to promote discussions on reconstruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AACC, they further proposed, should contribute effectively in promoting networks of hope among Africans spread out in the diaspora, Africans exiles as well as African students abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They suggested AACC's involvement in the facilitation of a series of consultations on the reconstruction of Africa with particular emphasis on culture and identity, Christianity/religion in Africa, democratization/popular participation, knowledge-based political economy and development among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AACC was also urged to establish working relations with the Conference of African Theological Institutions (CATI) and other regional associations of theological institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theologians also recommended that AACC explore possibilities of launching a continental scholarly journal with social reconstruction of Africa as its main focus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ecumenical body, delegates felt, should explore ways and means of working more closely with relevant departments of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) and regional bodies such as the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD), Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national councils of churches and confessional communions, the delegates recommended, should take the responsibility of furthering civic education among the general population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such education, they noted should include conscientisation on a pan-African approach to solving social, political and economic problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four-day theological meeting was organized by the Research and Development Unit of the AACC and was co-ordinated by its Executive Secretary Prof. Jesse Mugambi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monrovia (APS) - Liberia's long-awaited general elections are to go ahead as planned by a peace agreement concluded in August last year, despite recent calls within Liberia for their postponement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued here on April 27 after a four-day assessment visit, Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi said only heads of state of the 16-nation Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) were empowered to change the may 30 scheduled date of presidential and general elections in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only the ECOWAS heads of state can take a decision on such a critical and fundamental matter, and indeed after considering all aspects of the peace agreement,&quot; Ikimi told a press conference at the end of the visit to assess the implementation of the ECOWAS-brokered peace pact agreed on by Liberian warring parties in the Nigerial capital Abuja in August 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The peace deal called for ceasefire, disarmament, repatriation of refugees and set May 30 this year for the holding of democratic elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ikimi, who headed the ECOWAS committee of nine foreign ministers on Liberia, told the press conference after a four-day meeting at the Nigerian embassy here, &quot;We remain optimistic that free and fair elections can now indeed be safely conducted throughout Liberia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said those advocating extension of the elections date do not realize the consequences of the extension for the integrity of the entire peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ikimi noted some parties favoured a postponement of the elections date due to the lack of preparations, but ECOWAS was determined to remain within the framework of the Abuja accord, which set May 30 for general and presidential elections in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana's deputy Foreign Minister Victor Gheho also told reporters on April 26 that &quot;even if we consider a change, it will just be slightly. It may be between 15 and 30 days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Foreign Minister disclosed that his committee had met with leaders of political parties who wanted the elections rescheduled and expressed fears of insecurity in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many civilian officials, some Liberian religious leaders and political analysts had argued that the country is not yet ready for polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fortnight ago Roman Catholic bishops in Liberia called for a postponement of the elections, saying, &quot;the minimum condition necessary for free, fair democratic elections have not been met.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, said Ikimi, the commander of ECOMOG African peacekeeping force Major General Victor Malu, had offered to conduct the politicians on a tour of every constituency and location where elections will take place to reassure them of the high level of safety and security they can realistically expect from ECOMOG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ikimi also said that the assessment mission had taken serious note of their arguments, but the matter was for ECOWAS leaders to decide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspicions that the election might be delayed rose on April 23 when the Independent Electoral Commission (ECOM) suspended key party activity until further notice after complaints that the country was not ready for the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ECOM chairman Henry Andrews at the same time delayed the start of party conventions, the submission of party lists and the official opening of the campaign, complaining that the political parties, mostly representing the former warring factions, were failing to cooperate in the peace effort and were intimidating candidates from other parties from operating in areas they controlled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrews said the commission had received reports of harassment, obstruction, intimidation and extortion of Liberians returning to the country and said that some former armed factions were preventing genuine campaigning, but did not go into details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He slammed political parties set up by the main factions which fought the war here and are competing in the elections for misinforming the electorate and urged all political parties to inform and educate the electorate in the process of democratic competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any delay in the elections - the first in the country since a six-year war that cost the lives of more than 150,000 people - could risk upsetting some of the former warring factions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union and United States have backed the calling of the elections and the United States embassy here said officials of the US justice department and the African peacekeeping force will begin training 500 Liberian police officers on election security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the ECOM budget, Ikimi said ECOWAS maintains that the budget &quot;be realistic and realizable, and not bloated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the new ECOM budget was now reduced from 12 million US dollars to 7 million dollars, of which the international community will make available seven million dollars, while the Liberian Government would foot the rest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile a minister with the United Methodist Church in Liberia told APS he is convinced the electoral process in the country is adequate for holding for the holding of free and fair elections on May 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with APS, Rev. Julius Nelson said the Electoral Commission has now ensured the security necessary for the electoral process to go on uninterrupted, adding that many Liberians would see further delay as an impediment to the consolidation of the peace and development in their country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He however noted that long after the elections, this West African nation will still need additional relief ministries, continued repatriation and resettlement and counselling programmes among other forms of assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would be illusive to think that once the elections are held, the conflict will be over,&quot; Rev. Nelson stressed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Legal papers were served today on COSATU by Business South Africa aimed at interdicting our May 12th mass action focusing on the Basic Conditions of Employment Standards legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The papers claim that Section 77 of the LRA, the provision protecting procedural mass action, has not been observed in the calling of the May 12th action. Section 77 provides that those embarking on action need to serve notice on Nedlac more than 14 days in advance of such action. Nedlac lawyers are of the view that COSATU did indeed follow the required procedure.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By bringing this court action, BSA is showing contempt for the processes agreed to in Nedlac's Executive and Management Committees, which discussed this matter. These Committees had agreed that Nedlac would receive legal opinion as to the legal meaning of aspects of Section 77, no later than the 9th of May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, that where necessary procedures would be drawn up for future mass action, to guide Nedlac in implementing the provisions of Section 77. It is therefore disturbing to say the least, that BSA is bringing a court action on May 8th, a day before the decision which they were party to, is due to be implemented. This raises the obvious question as to why BSA is pre-empting an agreed process- it suggests that they are not confident that the legal opinion which will be given to Nedlac will support their argument. COSATU will propose a motion of censure at the Nedlac Executive Council on Friday, in protest at BSA's conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite their protestations, we do not believe that the BSA action is legally motivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather, it is an abuse of the courts to try, as employers have in the past, to intimidate workers embarking on legitimate mass action. Further, it is an attempt to get the court to limit the scope of the action. BSA is worried about the fact that the LRA protects workers embarking on such action from victimisation, and that the May 12 action will be the first major national action to be protected in terms of the new legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are also particularly concerned that COSATU will be taking action not only in support of our members, but also in support of the fundamental rights of all unorganised and vulnerable workers. This will deal a serious blow to employers attempts to create a dual labour market in which different rights are accorded to organised and unorganised workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COSATU is convinced, and we have legal opinion to this effect, that we have complied with Section 77 of the LRA, and that we followed the necessary procedures. We will therefore vigorously defend the court action. We believe that the application of BSA will be laughed out of court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However we hope that this doesn't mark the beginning of a trend by employers to attempt to use legal action, both in the ordinary courts and the Constitutional Court to chip away at, or limit fundamental rights which workers have won in the Constitution and legislation. Such an approach will only damage trust, both in Nedlac and industrial relations generally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is disturbing that BSA has given notice of this action today, exactly at the time when negotiations on the Basic Conditions of Employment Bill are resuming. By taking this action employers are showing that they have no intention on settling on the critical issues in the four days set aside for negotiations, and therefore are not focusing on averting the May 12 national mass action. Indeed their approach is likely to intensify the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From our side, we are more determined than ever that the action will continue. We are calling on our members to redouble their efforts. Marches and rallies will take place throughout the country from 12h00 on Monday May 12. The majority of workers will proceed to these actions from work. We are calling on workers to attend in their tens of thousands in support of our call for a 40 hour week, for paid maternity leave, and for no downward variation of basic rights in the Bill.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The World Conservation Union will not intervene in the lobby by some African governments for lifting of a ban in the international trade in elephant products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Union President Yolanda Kakabadse, told the Zimbabwe Inter-Africa News Agency on Wednesday that the conservation body would not take sides on issues involving the down-listing of the elephant, for fear of losing credibility as an organization whose members had different interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kakabadse arrived in Zimbabwe on Tuesday for a four-day visit. She is on a tour of Southern African countries to meet union members and visit projects funded by the organization,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said that said the union would only be able to supply concerned African governments with technical information to enable them to make decisions on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;African elephant range states (with rangelands) are the ones that will have to face this situation,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union, which has both governments and private sector representatives as members, would not she said &quot;take any pivotal role in this, even at the June Cites meeting in Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June, Zimbabwe hosts a meeting of parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, or Cites. Most Southern African countries are expected to use the platform to lobby for the down-listing of the elephant from appendix one to appendix two, which allows controlled international trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On environmental awareness in Africa, Kakabadse said governments on the continent should take a firm stance against environmental degradation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Decision makers should put in place policies that will deal with such issues as desertification,&quot; she said. &quot;Even those countries that still have to suffer from that problem will have to put in place such policies before the situation gets out of hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, she said the union was &quot;impressed by environmental projects being undertaken in the region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kakabadse, who had a briefing with union members in Zimbabwe, also held talks with Environment and Tourism Minister Chen Chimutengwende on her organization's current programmes in the country and its future initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union's mission is to conserve the diversity of nature and utilize natural resources in an equitable and ecologically sustainable way. It sponsors the Zimbabwe District Environmental Action Plan, the Save Catchment Area Rehabilitation Programme and INL002 from the strategic environmental assessment of developments throughout the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNITED NATIONS, New York (PANA) - Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows to Africa is shifting from traditional concentration on the region's primary commodities to service industries, a new United Nations report has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the report released Tuesday, the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development says FDI flows to Africa are moving into the finance and investment sectors, as well as to manufacturing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 462-page &quot;World Investment Directory on Africa,&quot; which surveys 53 African countries, is the most complete and authoritative source of data on investment trends and statistics.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a tool for potential investors to facilitate the process of investment stimulation for African countries,&quot; said Georg Kell of the Unctad office in New York, while launching the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency says that FDI flows to Africa, though still modest in absolute terms (4.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1996), were responsible for a significant share of Gross Domestic Capital formation and Gross Domestic Product.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of the encouraging news, the agency says that compared with other parts of the world, the overall volumes of FDI for Africa remain low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Between 1991 and 1995, Africa attracted only 5 percent of total FDI flows to developing countries and two percent of world FDI flows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Moreover, FDI in Africa remains concentrated in only a handful of countries. Nigeria and Egypt accounted for over half of FDI into Africa during the first half of the 1990s,&quot; the agency says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also says that Western European investors, mostly from France and Britain, still dominate FDI in Africa. The United States accounts for about 20 percent of inflows from developed countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency notes that the liberalization of investment and trade regimes in Africa are responsible for a new phenomenon: the emergence of the African Transnational Corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said that firms from Africa were becoming transnational corporations as they emerge as outward investors following the privatization process in many countries. Firms from South Africa and Nigeria lead in this area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked what could be done to increase FDI flows to Africa, particularly when many African countries have already liberalized their regulatory frameworks, Kell said that alleviating Africa's huge external debt was a major issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;External indebtedness is a major constraint for improving investment climate,&quot; he said</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABUJA, Nigeria (PANA) - Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, the only female candidate in Liberia's upcoming presidential election, says she is equal to the challenge of the male dominated race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Liberian men know what I am capable of,&quot; she told PANA Wednesday in the Nigerian capital, where she is attending the Africa First Ladies Summit on peace and humanitarian issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson-Sirleaf, 59, an accountant, economist, banker, diplomat and politician, resigned her United Nations job five months ago to join the Liberian presidential race.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said her male rivals knew she had been &quot;long in the struggle&quot; for a better Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I may not have the huge resources because all I have I earned by my sweat but I do not feel any gender barrier,&quot; she said. &quot;The election is not about money. It is about the future of the people of Liberia, someone who can deliver.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson-Sirleaf, who was involved in Liberian politics before, said her mission now &quot;was to restore the glory of Liberia,&quot; Africa's first republic founded in 1847 by freed slaves from the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have been to jail twice in my political life and I know what I am talking about,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson-Sirleaf, who can claim a brilliant diplomatic career, said she had the national and international clout to clinch the presidency and that she had confidence in the Ecowas-supervised electoral process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 16 political parties have sprung up to contest power in Liberia's post war elections slated for May 30, although there are indications the polls could be postponed by at least one month to allow for the mobilization of funds, thereby giving an equal chance to all the contenders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the election, Johnson-Sirleaf's Unity Party is up against serious challenges from former warlords Charles Taylor of the National Patriotic Party and Alhaji Kromah, leading a coalition of other parties.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The ANC National Working Committee (NWC) and leaders of the nine ANC provinces met in Johannesburg in one of its regular meetings on Monday 5 May. The meeting was attended by among others President Nelson Mandela and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other issues the NWC was briefed on preparations for a second ANC submission on military operations and security and intelligence activities to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) scheduled for 12-13 May in Cape Town.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NWC had noted that the first and second submissions will create a climate conducive for members to apply for amnesty as part of the ANC's contribution to healing and nation building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this regard, past and present members of the NEC, Revolutionary Council, former members of the various Regional Political Committees (RPC), former leaders in the Politico-Military Committees (PMC) and Self-Defence Units (SDU) will apply for amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Past and present members of the NEC will apply for amnesty within the context of the broad principle of collective responsibility for the conduct of the struggle where their conduct might have resulted in acts, omissions or offences envisaged in the TRC Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC's operations document will list military actions undertaken by Umkhonto Wesizwe (MK) and those not listed will be verifiable by the relevant military-politico structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC legal representatives as well as the Truth and Reconciliation Desk of the movement will submit these applications in terms of the Truth Commission Act section 19(5)(b) by Friday 9 May in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We join TRC Chairperson Archbishop Desmond Tutu's appeal for all our cadres and members who eligible in terms of the act to apply for amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PROVINCIAL BOUNDARIES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NWC further considered proposals regarding provincial boundaries with particular reference to Bushbuckridge, Taung/Kuruman and East Griqualand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NWC was of the view that boundaries are for administrative purposes and will not disadvantage people living on either sid of the provincial boundaries. We are people of one country with one national policy to redress the imbalances of the past. This national policy is applicable to all people irrespective of provinces in which they may reside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current disputes around borders have a negative impact on the reconstruction and development programme in the specific areas affected by such disputes. In this regard, the NWC expressed its unequivocal condemnation of the use of violence in the Bushbuckridge area as a means of perpetuating political objectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NWC agreed to meet with the Executive committees of both the Northern and Mpumalanga Provinces to discuss a proposal on the Grobelarsdal and Bushbuckridge situation. With regard to Taung/Kuruman boundary dispute, the NWC was of the view that discussions on the matter should await the recommendations of the Shubane Commission in this regard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WOMEN'S LEAGUE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NWC had also noted the recent ANC Women's League conference and expressed its congratulations for the newly elected leadership of the League, and in its ability as a collective to meet the challenges facing women with regard to peace, development and reconstruction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - In reference to an article that appeared in Malawi News Online No. 28, entitled COMESA SECRETARY GENERAL DISMISSED, Africa News Network prints a letter from Peter Mutharika and a press release from Dr. Bingu Mutharika:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In Malawi News Online No. 28 you carried in item 8 that COMESA Secretary General had been dismissed. As the forwarded press release shows, Dr.  Mutharika was not dismissed. He resigned. The story that he had been dismissed was obviously promulgated by those elements in Malawi who are believed to be behind Dr Mutharika's difficulties at COMESA I would appreciate if you would correct the story in your next issue. Peter Mutharika.  .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Press release: I announce that I have resigned as Secretary General of COMESA effective 17 April 1997. My decision to step down has been taken following the recent developments at the secretariat of COMESA in Lusaka. I am very happy, however that allegations made against me for financial mismanagement or impropriety could not be substantiated.This is because there had been no financial mismanagement in the first place. Therefore I am leaving this organisation with my head high and with honour and dignity. I have served my term of office as COMESA Secretary General with distinction , dedication, competence and integrity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COMESA has now established a well-proven track of success. COMESA is now being emulated by other regional economic groupings. I am deeply satisfied with the regional framework which COMESA has been able to achieve under my leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have developed PTA and later COMESA to the highest standards of regional cooperation and integration. COMESA now has a clear vision, a clear mission and a clear sense of direction. I was also able to develop a political consensus among the Heads os State that the common market offers a viable alternative for sustained growth and development of our countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COMESA is truly an organisation of African people, executed by Africans for the benefit of African people. Another matter of great satisfaction for me has been the consensus and compact which I have promoted between COMESA and the donor communities, international organisations and the private sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These organisations now play a positive role in regional economic integration in Eastern and Southern Africa. For instance. when I came to PTA in 1991, the total aid package of PTA was only about US$12 million. By 1996, this had risen to over US$100 million.I therefore believe a sound framework has been created for COMESA to work positively with the donor communities in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I pay tribute to all donors who are supporting COMESA. My greatest reward is that COMESA is a reality and is viable. Since taking over its leadership, the volume of intra-COMESA trade rose to nearly US$2 billion and has been growing at an annual rate of over 10 per cent.Tariffs have largely been reduced by the majority of the member states and many non-tariff barriers have been abolished.Trade information systems have been implemented and inter- country transit facilitation measures are in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I now take this opportunity to publicly express deep appreciation to the COMESA Heads of State and Government and, to the COMESA Council of Ministers , for having given me the opportunity to serve as their Secretary General for the past six years. More specifically, for the various Heads of State who served as Chairmen of COMESA during my tenure I owe them a deep sense of gratitude for their guidance and support for me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I also wish to thank the Government and people of Zambia for cooperating with me during the past six years and for making me feel at home here in Zambia. The support of the Government of Zambia made my task much easier and indeed very pleasant. I pledge that I will continue to promote and support COMESA in future.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawsuit follows the publication of a letter Mpasu wrote to President Bakili Muluzi, alleging that Mary Nyandovi-Kerr was using WWB's money for personal use and ambition, included in which were her aspirations to the presidency. The letter also accuses Kerr of allegedly making disparaging remarks about Muluzi's educational qualifications. She had said that they were &quot;not good enough&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muluzi responded to the letter saying as a result of the allegations he had instructed the Reserve Bank of Malawi, which has been one of WWB's credit lines, to scrap the organisation from the central bank's list of participating institutions in the Small and Medium Enterprise Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyandovi-Kerr has denied the allegations saying they were baseless and aimed at crippling her reputation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyandovi-Kerr fell out of favour in UDF mainstream politics when she stood as an independent candidate in the 1994 general elections which pitted her against a fellow UDF bigwig for a parliamentary seat in a Zomba (South Malawi) constituency. She lost the seat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Improved tobacco prices on Auction Floors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tobacco prices improved on the third day of recent sales in the capital, Lilongwe, to the relief of both farmers and officials. Tobacco is Malawi's biggest foreign exchange earner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tobacco sold at an average price of U$2.15 per kilogramme up from US1.60 per kilogramme on the first two days of sales. Farmers, unhappy with the low prices offered by buyers on April 15 and 16 caused a stir at the floors as they went on the rampage scattering tobacco in protest against the prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government expected 115 million kilogrammes of burley tobacco and about 15 million kilogrammes of dark fired tobacco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Manager for the Tobacco Control Commission Dr Godfrey Chapola said although the country experienced heavy rains this year, the tobacco that had been brought to the Auction Floors had been dry and of good quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sales in Blantyre and Mzuzu started April 21 and May 5, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Muluzi blames strike on opposition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Bakili Muluzi has accused the opposition Alliance for Democracy (Aford) for fuelling the on-going strike by civil servants in order to gain political mileage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The allegation is contained in a letter which Muluzi wrote to the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions (LO-Norway) in response to concerns raised by that organisation over the harassment of civil servants trade union members by the Malawi police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muluzi, who only on April 26 made an impassioned plea for unity in the country, claims that the vast majority of the civil servants in south and central Malawi had abandoned the strike because, he alleged, they did not agree with what the trade union leaders were doing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is only in the Northern Region where the Alliance for Democracy (Aford), is desperately trying to hijack the strike that acts of violence by civil servants on fellow civil servants are continuing,&quot; Muluzi alleged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LO-Norway wrote Muluzi expressing its concern about reports of police brutality against striking civil servants who have been on strike for four weeks now. Muluzi, however, claimed that Lo-Norway was largely misinformed about the strike saying the civil servants were refusing to accept the most historic pay rise given to them ranging from 10 to 47 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aford has dismissed the allegations saying Muluzi was well aware of what had caused the strike. Aford's publicity secretary Dan Msowoya said Aford was the party that championed democracy in the fight for political pluralism in Malawi and could not now contradict itself by destroying the very tenets of democracy it fought for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Police increase action against strikers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in all the country's three regions have stepped up their action against the striking civil servants, resorting to teargas, allegedly beating some of the strikers and arresting others. Acting on orders from the Inspector General of Police, Patrick Chikapa, to deal with the strikers participating in demonstrations, police in the commercial city of Blantyre, the administrative capital Lilongwe and the northern city of Mzuzu, allegedly beat up and arrested union leaders for organising the demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The civil servants want government to implement the Chatsika Report which recommends civil servants salary increments and an improvement in their working conditions. The civil servants have rejected salary rises ranging from 47% for the lowest paid to 10% for the highest paid civil servants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teachers, who have been on holiday since the strike started four weeks ago, joined their fellow civil servants April 29 and called for the speedy implementation of the Teaching Service Commission. In Lilongwe, several teachers who were demonstrating peacefully were bitten by police dogs which were let loose by police. So far government has shown no willingness to come to the negotiating table with the union leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. 7 die in mini-bus accident</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven people died April 28 when a Blantyre-Lilongwe mini-bus overturned in Ntcheu, central Malawi. Police in Ntcheu said five of the victims died on the spot while two were pronounced dead on arrival at Ntcheu hospital. They said several more people were injured in the accident which happened after the driver of the mini-bus failed to negotiate a corner at Njolomole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another incident, a 16 year old girl committed suicide on the same day over a love affair. The Chichiri Secondary schoolgirl, Emma Mutuku, who was said to have been pregnant committed suicide allegedly after she discovered that her boy friend had a relationship with another girl at the same school.  Her grief-stricken grandmother said Emma killed herself by swallowing five packets of rat poison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. British couple murdered</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A British couple, resident in Malawi, was murdered in neighbouring Mozambique on or about April 13 while on their way to Malawi from Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew and Carloyn McDown, who were teaching at Bishop Macknenzie School in the capital Lilongwe met their fate on the border between Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Marilyn Bennet, Information Officer at the British High Commission in Lilongwe, said on April 20 that investigations were underway jointly between the Maputo government and her country's embassy in Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. MHC loses case on rents</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Malawi Housing Corporation, the country's housing utility company, has lost a major lawsuit against its tenants on the corporation's decision to hike rentals on its housing units aimed at making it operate on a commercial basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The High Court ruled on April 27 that the MHC, which raised rents by more than 100%, violated Section 7 of the Malawi Housing Act which states that the organisation is a non-profit making entity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MHC increased rents in April 1996 by more than 100% in a bid to make the institution operate on a commercial basis and to enable the organisation to put up more housing units as well as improve the maintenance of existing houses. Some MHC tenants with the help of the Consumers Association of Malawi challenged the increase of the rentals in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his ruling, Justice Duncan Tambala ordered that the tenants be credited the rents paid since April 1 last year. MHC chairperson Mrs Joyce Banda said following the ruling the parastatal would have to lay off staff and suspend most of its contruction projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. National soccer coach dismissed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National soccer coach, Reuben Malola has been dismissed. The verdict to fire him was made at a meeting held on April 30 and attended by officials from the Malawi National Council of Sports (MNCS) and the Football Association of Malawi (FAM).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the meeting it was unanimously agreed that Malola's performance with the national soccer team had not been impressive. The national team has been losing game after game due to what is believed to be a result of poor coaching. &quot;Malola had run out of ideas,&quot; said a FAM official who asked for anonymity. The straw that broke the camel's back was Malawi's 4-0 defeat at the hands of Zambia on 12 April in the Africa Castle Cup competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A source at the MNCS said it was only by sheer luck that Malola remained coach of the national soccer team as a decision to fire him had already been made sometime in February but he was spared the axe by Malawi's 2-0 win against Mozambique in the Africa Cup of Nations in February. This is the second time that Malola has been fired as coach of the Malawi National soccer team. He was last given the boot as national team coach in 1989 when Malawi lost 4-0 to Zimbabwe. Malola later had a stint with a leading Kenyan soccer team which he coached for four years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - If former president Kamuzu Banda did not fulfil all legal requirements pertaining to the acquisition of his business undertakings while he ruled the country, he might eventually find himself cash-strapped and 'stripped to the flesh' as the ruling UDF-led government goes on dismantling the remaining bastions of his economic empire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First to be targeted for dispossession or nationalisation by the present government was the huge and largely successful trading conglomerate, the Press Trust, which until 1995 was widely believed to be Dr Banda's private business enterprise. It was Aleke Banda, Finance Minister, who once headed Press Corporation Limited, who convinced parliament that Dr Banda fraudulently turned to personal ownership an organisation founded with public funds. To this effect, he moved a motion in parliament to reconstruct the Press Trust Act. Naturally, the motion received heavy protests from the opposition Malawi Congress Party.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before the dust had completely settled over the wrangling on the Press Trust issue, the beleaguered former dictator was slapped with what Director of Public Prosecutions, Kamudoni Nyasulu termed a master fraud case involving K137 million (U$9.1 million) from the Press Trust. Nyasulu argues that the money was drawn on the pretext that it was going to be used in the construction and running of the Kamuzu Academy, the grammar school that Dr Banda built in his home district of Kasungu. The Kamuzu Academy is also believed to have been constructed and run with funds from Dr Banda's personal finances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest development concerning Dr Banda's assets is the reallocation of 2,000 acres of land in south Malawi to the ordinary people. This, according to the UDF, is because while Banda ruled he dispossessed or grabbed from the ordinary folk this huge chunk of land knowing they could 'not say no to a life president.' Dr Banda never obtained a lease on the land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fachi told the nation on May 4 that acting on powers vested in him as Lands and Valuation minister, he had directed that the disputed land on which Banda established a cattle ranch be distributed to the ordinary people. Following the directive, Dr Banda will lose annual profits to the tune of K15 million (U$ 1 million) from the cattle raising business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The country is systematically witnessing the stripping naked of a once powerful personality whose influence in Malawi could be felt from thousands of kilometres away,&quot; said an observer who did not want to be named nor say which side he favours in the on-going strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the MCP wishes to undertake a campaign to prove that Dr Banda never grabbed any piece of land from people in the lower Shire by force, leaders in the ruling camp are also determined to see to it that their viewpoint emerges victorious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A race has thus been started by both camps to win the support of the local populace in the area. On May 5, Fachi was in his land of birth in the lower Shire where he told the people there that Dr Banda had been given two weeks, starting May 5, to dismantle his ranch and either move the 2,000 strong herd of cattle to another area, or to auction or slaughter them. The land, said Fachi, would be given to those who owned it before Dr Banda grabbed it from them in 1978 when the ranch was established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot have one man owning 2,000 acres of land in an area where many people have nothing at all,&quot; said Fachi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - The Moldenhauer Commission into Fraudulent Licenses had to reprimand a group of plain clothes officials from Mpumalanga's safety &amp; security department on Wednesday after they allegedly intimidated witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group of six or seven officials had stationed themselves in the court room where the Commission was hearing testimony, as well as in a corridor outside the court room and on the front steps of the court building in Nelspruit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission chairman, chief magistrate Heinrich Moldenhauer has reported the incident to both Mpumalanga premier Mathews Phosa and the official's head of department. He threatened to have them arrested if they were caught harassing witnesses.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission's scheduled hearings also had to be cut short on Wednesday when provincial traffic director, Henry Brazer, failed to appear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazer, who has been implicated in issuing an invalid drivers and learners license to Parliamentary deputy speaker Baleka Mbete-Kgositsile, was informed on Monday afternoon that he would have to testify but was &quot;unexpectedly&quot; admitted to hospital for a stress and heart related ailment on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His doctors have reportedly said that he may only be able to testify next week. Brazer was also booked off work after a minor heart attack on October 1 last year when he never-the-less drove 350km from Nelspruit to Delmas to personally test Mbete-Kgositsile for her licenses &quot;as a sign of respect&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazer is not the only implicated official who was booked into hospital for stress this week.  Magistrate Moldenhauer announced on Wednesday that he had been forced to postpone safety &amp; security MEC Steve Mabona's scheduled testimony next week after being informed that Mabona has also been admitted to hospital for an unspecified stress related ailment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabona had been asked to appear to explain why he specially sent his State vehicle and personal bodyguards to drive Mbete-Kgositsile from Johannesburg to Delmas and why he had asked Brazer, who is not registered as a certified testing officer, to test Mbete-Kgositsile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the second time since African Eye News Service (South Africa) first revealed irregularities in Mbete-Kgositsile's license that Mabona has been admitted to a private clinic for stress.  Mabona's head of department, Advocate Stanley Soko, who has been accused of quashing an internal investigation into Mbete-Kgositsile's licenses, was also admitted to hospital with an unspecified stress ailment on Wednesday and has declared himself unavailable for testimony this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unavailability of the three key witnesses may, Magistrate Moldenhauer said, force Premier Phosa to extend the Commission's term of reference beyond May 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the safety &amp; security officials, who were smartly dressed in suits and ties, would say what they were doing at the commission on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were however seen questioning court orderlies about who the witnesses were, what exactly their testimony had revealed about Mpumalanga safety &amp; security MEC, Steve Mabona, and about who else was still expected to testify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The security men also allegedly tried to question witnesses as they left the court room about what they had said before the Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief magistrate Heinrich Moldenhauer publicly reprimanded the officials at the hearing after first summoning one of them, assistant director Phillip Mahlangu to his chambers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I told him that this Commission will in no way allow even the impression that there is intimidation here. We have the power to immediately summon the police to deal with anyone accused of threatening or harassing witnesses or court officials - whether those accused are government officials or not,&quot; he told African Eye News Service (South Africa) afterwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moldenhauer added that Mahlangu had claimed Mabona had sent him to attend the hearings &quot;to listen to what was said here&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manzini - For the first time in seven years, the Swaziland cotton farming industry expects to net more than R48-million from an anticipated 46 000 tonne bumper crop this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will be the highest yield since the 1990, when a crippling drought which only ended last season, first gripped the small landlocked Kingdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Swaziland Cotton Board Chief Executive Tom Jele, the industry only managed to produce 14 000 tonnes last year, as it started to recover from the drought.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because cotton is cultivated manually and harvested by hand in Swaziland, it is reputed to have a higher quality visual appearance, as well as stronger and longer fibre micronaire which is highly sought after in the shirt-making and bed sheet industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kingdom is the second highest cotton producer in the Southern African Customs Union after South Africa. The total SACU cotton crop this year is expected to be 190 000 bales of lint, of which Swaziland will account for 46, 000 tonnes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike Swaziland's other agriculture products such sugar, citrus and beef that are favoured for the European Community market, the bulk of cotton is sold in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also increasingly being sold to the growing local textile industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year's cotton price was fixed at R2.40 per kg on April 23, 1997 (1997$$$] by the five nation SACU cotton boards. The price is a 0.20 cent improvement on last year's price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To encourage cotton cultivation, the price of cotton is protected from the effects of market fluctuations by price stabilisation funds established in each country. The Kingdom's cotton stabilisation fund, which is raised through levies, currently stands at R2 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1993 the board intervened to top 10 cents to bring the price of cotton to R1.60.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farmers who abandoned growing the crop during the drought are reportedly returning to cotton cultivation in their droves. This year, 10,000 individual growers registered themselves as growing cotton on both Swazi National Land and private sector title deed farm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figure is the highest since the drought first gripped the country. The crop which had dropped to an all-time-low of 6,000 farmers at the height of the drought, is expected to return to the 16000 peak before the drought.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUSHBUCKRIDGE - A Lebowa Transport bus was ambushed and torched by pro- Mpumalanga demonstrators on Wednesday morning after more than 20 passengers were first forced off the bus by the protesters.  The ambush, which has been condemned by both the police and the Bushbuckridge Border Crisis Committee, occurred in Marite near where a large Home Affairs office complex was torched last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstrations are part of a two week defiance campaign by greater Bushbuckridge residents, who are demanding the immediate transfer of their region from Northern Province to Mpumalanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrations last week also resulted in a police 4x4 patrol van, two large freight trucks and a number of government vehicles being torched after police allegedly fired rubber bullets, live ammunition and tear gas into a peaceful Workers Day rally.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police patrols in the heavily populated peri-rural area were also stoned on Tuesday night but no arrests or injuries were reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Crisis Committee spokesmen have condemned the violence, Themba Godi, said on Wednesday afternoon that the heavy police and army presence in the area was aggravating the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are the same people who shot at us last week. People are therefore understandably agitated when they are around. We also hear that the police have been instructed to keep the road from Nelspruit to the Kruger National Park open at any cost - now who is more important, the citizens of this country or tourists,&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Godi confirmed that the Border Crisis Committee would enforce a list of eight resolutions adopted by more than 10 000 pro-Mpumalanga protesters who met at the Thulamahashe Stadium on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resolutions include a call for residents to rebuild the barricades on all major roads in the area which sparked riots and ultimately led to the arrest of 30 protesters. Other resolutions include a stipulation that local residents will remove all Northern Province registration plates from their vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents also resolved to prevent buses belonging to either Lebowa or Gaza Transport from operating in the area and to boycott all rent and service charges levied by local authorities. Bushbuckridge Border Crisis Committee secretary, Sizile Ndlovu, told African Eye News Service (South Africa) after the meeting that residents were also demanding a meeting with all local councillors and MECs from both the Mpumalanga and Northern Province provincial governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These people must come and explain to us why they are playing political games with our futures. We are toyi-toying on the streets while they are swimming in sweet gravy-train soup,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To re-inforce their demands for an immediate transfer, Ndlovu said that all local pupils, teachers and government employees would embark on a stay-away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regional women's organisations and burial societies have also been asked to organise a march by naked women on the Union Buildings in Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women have been asked to march naked to show their disrespect for local politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't plan to be, or want to be the cause of violence or property damage. But we have been promised this transfer for almost two years now, and are still chained to the Northern Province,&quot; Ndlovu added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people of Bushbuckridge work in Mpumalanga, shop there and entertain themselves there. We are historically part of Mpumalanga and demand to be recognised as such.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All 30 suspects appeared in court on Monday afternoon, where 21 were released on their own recognisance until their case is heard on 30 May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remaining nine suspects have to pay R100 bail each before they will be released. None of the suspects could afford the bail and are still being held at Bushbuckridge Police Station</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the nine prisoners smuggled a letter out via a visitor, claiming that they have not been fed properly, had been refused baths, had not been given water to drink and had been assaulted by police guards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police were also earlier accused of sparking violence by shooting at crowds and beating pro-Mpumalanga protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police spokesman Captain Thomas Ramatseba denied the prisoner's claims on Tuesday but appealed to the wider Bushbuckridge community to report the specifics of the alleged beatings during demonstrations so that the incidents could be properly investigated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SHEEPMOOR - Police are investigating the murder of an executive member of the National Party in Sheepmoor, Mpumalanga, who was found dead along the road to Sheepmoor prison on Saturday after being stabbed in the neck and groin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Party regional secretary for the Eastvaal region, Arisja Chantler, said on Wednesday the party believed the two suspects arrested in connection with the murder of Saul Nkosi were ANC members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said NP members in Sheepmore were regularly threatened and intimidated, including the chairperson of the Sheepmoor NP branch, Moses Nkosi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the Youth Action chairperson of the eMbalenhle branch in the Highveld Ridge area had also been stabbed several times and rushed to the Evander hospital where he is in a stable condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkosi was allegedly stabbed at his house at Sheepmoor squatter camp and then attempted to walk to the police station but died along the way and was found on Saturday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspects, Elphas Bhembe of Ermelo and Daniel Mtshali of Dundonald, were arrested later in the day at Nkosi's house were they were arguing with his girlfriend's friend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They appeared in the Amsterdam magistrate's court on Monday where they were not asked to plead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case was postponed to May 9 for a bail hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigating officer, Sgt Mbongeni Moyeni, could not confirm whether the suspects were ANC members or whether Nkosi was a NP member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provincial NP chairperson, Dr Lucas Nel, said if the murder and other alleged threats against NP members in Sheepmoor were politically motivated, the essence of democracy, reconciliation and nation-building were in jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NP Member of Parliament, Watty Watson, said every means would be used to safeguard party members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would be a pity if other parties start resorting to uncivilized actions leading to the deaths of innocent people,&quot; he said. .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - The tens of thousands of illegal driver's licenses issued by corrupt traffic officers in Mpumalanga are the reason for the high accident rate in the province, the Moldenhauer Commission heard in Nelspruit on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief provincial traffic inspector Johan Hermanus Visagie told the Commission that many of the applicants who were issued with driver's licenses at four centres in the province had not been able to handle their vehicles in test yards, &quot;never mind on the roads&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visagie also said that he had personally witnessed people from as far afield as the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu/ Natal being tested for Code 10, or heavy truck licenses in small bakkies or saloon vehicles on test centre courses which were &quot;hopelessly&quot; inadequate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the centres was using a soccer field as a testing yard, while others were simply open pieces of veld. At Ekangala, where I was sent as centre head, we didn't even have offices and had to work out of our cars in an open field,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visagie insisted that he had repeatedly objected to the conditions he and his officers were forced to work under but was told &quot;not to interfere&quot; by provincial traffic director, Henry Brazer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazer failed to arrive to testify before the commission on Wednesday after reportedly being admitted to hospital with a stress related heart ailment.  His doctors said that he may only be able to testify next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission chairman, chief magistrate Heinrich Moldenhauer, had requested that Brazer appear to explain the circumstances surrounding his issue of a learners and drivers license to parliamentary deputy speaker Baleka Mbete- Kgositsile on October 1 last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazer issued the license on incorrect license certificates, made factual errors on the application forms and allegedly failed to test Mbete-Kgositsile on at least two of the prescribed practical skills stipulated by traffic legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her license is therefore invalid, say traffic officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazer is also not registered as a certified license testing officer and was book off work on October 1 after suffering a mild heart attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I even told Brazer that I would refuse to continue testing applicants, because although they were being issued with legal licenses, not one single license was actually valid - I mean, these people were given licenses literally 15-minutes after entering the centres,&quot; Visagie said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Again I was told just to observe and not to interfere - but I was never promoted. Even people with only Standard Eight certificates were made assistant directors, but I remained a testing officer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visagie told Magistrate Moldenhauer that the only way to address the &quot; licensed road murderers&quot; was to either re-test all drivers who had got their licenses from the affected centres or to introduce a national system where all drivers had to re-test for licenses after certain period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This way we will be able to gradually phase them out,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visagie also said that the torching of a R1,2-million centre in KwaMhlanga could have been motivated by officers who were afraid that an internal investigation into fraudulent licenses might reveal that they had not actually qualified for the ranks they claimed their salaries on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I was there, there were some officers with absolutely no personnel files at all and some whose files showed they were junior officers - and not assistant directors as their uniform badges showed,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMSTERDAM - Prominent Highveld Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) activist, Sipho Daniel Mbatha, is scheduled to appear in the Amsterdam Magistrate's Court on Thursday after allegedly murdering two ANC members last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbatha was previously charged with only one murder and pleaded not-guilty.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charge was however later changed to double murder after Smangele Nkosi (32) died of her head and kidney wounds last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkosi was the girlfriend of Mbatha's first alleged victim, Elias Mpanza, and was allegedly shot by Mbatha a couple of months after Mpanza's murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbatha was not asked to defend his actions during previous court hearings and court documents give no motive for the alleged murder.  The greater Amsterdam community has staged two protest marches to the Amsterdam Police Station, where Mbatha is being held, to demand that he be given the death penalty or life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - The Mpumalanga Education Department faces a shortfall of R594 million for the 1997/98 budget year, said MEC for Education, David Mabuza during his budget speech in the Mpumalanga legislature on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabuza said his department needed an extra R372 million alone to cover personnel costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The total budget allocation is R2 billion which is a far cry in relation to the mandate given to this department,&quot; Mabuza said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the department had received 1 046 applications for voluntary severance packages, 16 of which had been approved, and which would cost the department R2,2 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said 1 132 promotional posts also had to be created and filled by August 1, which would cost an additional R57 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It must be noted that, unlike in the public service, the award of voluntary severance packages to educators does not mean freezing posts, because of the ever-increasing numbers of learners who are entering the formal education sector,&quot; Mabuza explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said teachers preferred the redeployment option to accepting voluntary severance packages, as was indicated by the fact that the province had reached an equilibrium with regards to the number of learners and educators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabuza said those accepting voluntary redeployment came from former black schools, whereas &quot;some quarters&quot; were reluctant and resisting redeployment and rightsizing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is being addressed,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabuza added that an unforeseen problem was that of rapid urbanisation and the influx of foreigners from neighbouring states, which had led to an increase in squatter camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This in itself places great pressure on the department's ability to provide the most essential education facilities timeously,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabuza said the financial allocation to his department had major inadequacies considering South Africa had to adapt to globalisation of the economy which demanded skilled human resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past budget year, the department of education provided and improved 957 classrooms, 90 special rooms, 50 administration blocks, and 1 519 toilets in the past year as part of 331 separate projects. .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUSHBUCKRIDGE - More than 10 000 pro-Mpumalanga protesters resolved on Tuesday to rebuild barricades on all major roads in the area in an attempt to force the government to transfer the region from Northern Province to Mpumalanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar barricades last week led to clashes between police and protesters after a large Home Affairs office complex, three trucks and a police 4x4 patrol vehicle were burnt out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirty protesters were arrested after the unrest and charged with arson and disrupting public order.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight resolutions were adopted during the rally at Thulamahashe Stadium on Tuesday, including a stipulation that local residents will remove all Northern Province registration plates from their vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents also resolved to prevent buses belonging to either Lebowa or Gaza Transport from operating in the area and to boycott all rent and service charges levied by local authorities. Bushbuckridge Border Crisis Committee secretary, Sizile Ndlovu, told African Eye News Service (South Africa) after the meeting that residents were also demanding a meeting with all local councillors and MECs from both the Mpumalanga and Northern Province provincial governments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't plan to be, or want to be the cause of violence or property damage. But we have been promised this transfer for almost two years now, and are still chained to the Northern Province,&quot; Ndlovu added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Mpumalanga safety &amp; security MEC, Steve Mabona, illegally ordered the re-instatement of 3 000 suspected fraudulent driver's licenses while they were still being investigated by the police, the Moldenhauer Commission into Fraudulent Licenses heard on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Principal traffic inspector, John Muller, told the Commission that the licenses had been suspended from the Home Affairs population register computer system in 1995 after his investigations had revealed that they had been issued irregularly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabona, however, sent a letter to Home Affairs director, Piet Colyn in August 1995 saying that the investigation had been completed and that the 3000 odd licenses had been cleared and should therefore be re-instated on the computer system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muller, who has received death threats, had his salary stopped, had his State issue car repossessed and who has been publicly branded a racist on national radio by Mabona, reported the matter to the Justice Department and the provincial Director General, Frank Mbatha, but was allegedly ignored.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Repeated requests for national intervention and a Commission of Inquiry were also ignored, he said, until Muller told African Eye News Service (South Africa) that one of the irregular licenses had been issued to Parliamentary deputy speaker, Baleka Mbete-Kgositsile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequent press reports in Sunday Times resulted in the immediate establishment of the Moldenhauer Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have been investigating this issue, often in the face of severe opposition, since 1988 when I first joined the traffic department. But, even now that it is out in the open, my future looks very bleak - I don't see how I will ever have any control over it again,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite having no personal or constituency links with Mpumalanga, Mbete- Kgositsile was issued both a learners and drivers license on October 1 last year after she was driven from Johannesburg to Delmas in MEC Mabona's State issue car by his personal bodyguards, as &quot;a sign of respect&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provincial traffic director, Henry Brazer, who was booked off work sick at the time after a minor heart attack, drove 350km from Nelspruit to Delmas on the same day to personally test Mbete-Kgositsile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazer is not registered as a certified testing officer and reportedly used incorrect test procedures and application forms while issuing the two licenses. No official records of the tests or license were kept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muller testified on Tuesday that two additional bags of fraudulent licenses, which he had discovered hidden in a dustbin at a test centre, had been stolen from his office and that 11 of the 20 license testing officers currently operating in the former KaNgwane were not in fact properly qualified to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also told the commission that after two 'master' license books, containing 200 blank licenses were irregularly issued to Brazer in 1993, he and two other senior officials were ordered to retrieve them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muller said that they confronted Brazer at Nelspruit's Private Hospital where he was recovering from an unspecified sickness and while Brazer admitted to having the books, he refused to give the investigators his safe keys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A couple of days later, he claimed that the books had been stolen from the safe - although he conceded that there was no forced entry or other proof of burglary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muller also testified that at least one traffic officer who was charged with fraud and corruption by police had been promoted by Brazer after being suspended and had been paid R13 000 'back-pay'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I also think the Commission should look at appointments in the department in general, because Brazer and his wife interviewed people on their own for posts over weekends. Brazer's wife doesn't work for the traffic department - she works in the Premier's office,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During cross-examination by chief magistrate Heinrich Moldenhauer, Muller also said that he had seen a possibly irregular license for Brazer's son, which had been issued at the Kabokweni test centre on his 18th birthday.  Mbete-Kgositsile's licenses were issued on Kabokweni letterheads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confirming that the 3000 fraudulent licenses which were re-instated by Mabona and tens of thousands of others all appeared legal at face value, Muller said that the government only had two options; scrap all licenses issued in KaNgwane since 1988 or accept them and immediately tighten control of testing officers and centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, he said, should preferably be done by an outside agency such as the Department of Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is practically impossible to just scrap all suspected licenses as some of them may actually be legal - but perhaps we should begin retesting all suspects,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confirming he had been intimidated and victimised, Muller said that he was uncertain whether he would be able to continue working for the traffic department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would like to appeal to all law enforcement personnel throughout the country to persevere in their investigations and to remember that no-one is above the law. In the end, righteousness and justice will prevail,&quot; said Muller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am one of the most highly qualified traffic inspectors in Mpumalanga and am not a junior trouble maker, lair or racist as referred to by my so-called superiors.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Turbo-charging the engine of change in South Africa through sport and economic development is the essence of the opportunity offered by the Olympic bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the message Bid Company chief executive Chris Ball will convey in a special edition of a business report to be published soon by Cape Town company Omega Investment Research, headed by former politician and diplomat Denis Worrall.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By combining sport and the undeniable economic benefits of hosting a South African Olympics, we believe we can take a giant's stride in fulfilling Nelson Mandela's dream for a new republic,&quot; Mr Ball says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also makes the point that South Africa is not in the Olympic race merely &quot;to win silver&quot;, but is going for gold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The special report, edited jointly by political scientist David Welsh and consultant and former journalist Vuyo Bavuma, offers foreign investors and business people an insight into the opportunities and risks of doing business with the new South Africa into the next millennium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will provide exposure for Cape companies abroad but also boost the lobbying process, particularly in the sense of providing the material for a reasoned assessment of South Africa's political and economic future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has emerged as a key issue in the Olympic lobbying process - there is a perception that the stability of South Africa's nascent democracy depends more than anything else on the presence at its helm of President Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerns about a post-Mandela South Africa will be addressed directly in the business report.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - France has dispatched a frigate to the South Atlantic to prevent the fish poaching around French possessions and has offered to help South Africa deal with a similar problem</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France's decision to send a frigate to the South Atlantic to prevent poaching of the Patagonian toothfish by fishing vessels from Europe and the Far East is an indication of how serious the problem has become and reinforces the warnings from environmentalists that fish resources throughout the region are now under serious threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The French action also demonstrates South Africa's disturbing vulnerability to this growing international crime. Most of the fish resources now being taken illegally around the French islands of Crozet and Kergeulen also exist within South Africa's own exclusive economic zones, especially around Gough and Marion islands, where poaching is now reported to be extensive and brazen.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the offer by France to co-operate with South Africa in preventing the rape of marine resources will be appreciated, it is clearly far from being a satisfactory answer to the problem. South Africa should not have to depend so helplessly on others to protect its economic interests, least of all within its own economic zones, and urgent attention will have to be given to an effective national response to poaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Providing the South African navy with warships to prevent poaching is one option. Another, mooted in the past, is to share the huge costs involved in dealing with the problem through the formation of a multinational force to deal with the threat to the maritime resources of all countries with interests in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dispatching of a French frigate to the region, and the warning yesterday by French ambassador Tristan d'Albis of the extent of the illegal activity, serve as a jarring wake-up call. The longer poaching is allowed to continue the more intractable and menacing the problem will become.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Magnus Malan, former defence minister and earlier chief of the South African Defence Force, admitted in Cape Town today he had approved the establishment of the Civil Co-operation Bureau (CCB) in the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He disclosed to the Truth Commission tha he had at times given orders which had resulted in the deaths of &quot;innocent civilians in crossfire&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He sincerely regretted such deaths, but had never issued any orders for political assassinations, nor had he ever been approached to authorise such assassinations, he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The killing of political opponents of the (then) government, such as the slaying of (Witwatersrand University academic) Dr (David) Webster, never formed part of the brief of the SADF,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, the TRC was told in an affidavit that a former CCB member, Ferdi Barnard, had admitted privately to friends that he had shot Dr Webster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under cross-examination, General Malan said former CCB members involved in assassinations should be prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Malan also denied that a so-called &quot;Third Force&quot; - a parallel force to the SADF and the SA Police, specifically to combat unrest - had ever been established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He confirmed such a force had been proposed and then investigated by a sub- committee of the State Security Council headed by the then Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok, but the council had finally decided not to institute such a force. He had always been opposed to the establishment of such a force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the stark reality which this commission will have to face up to I want to lay this ghost to rest once and for all,&quot; General Malan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his voluntary submission to the commission, General Malan said he assumed full moral responsibility for the actions of soldiers who had been under his command. He offered his &quot;unqualified apologies&quot; for any unlawful actions by them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the SADF and the ANC had acted in a &quot;bona fide&quot; manner to promote their cause, &quot;painful though it may be&quot;.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - When Chay Blyth took to the ocean wave in the early Seventies to go around the world - the so-called wrong way, without stopping - he thought he had a fair idea of what he was letting himself in for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that he succeeded in becoming the first man to sail around the globe non-stop, against the prevailing trade winds, had little to do with luck and a lot more to do with good preparation and a good boat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afterwards, however, in his book about his adventure, The Impossible Voyage, he admitted it was a greater challenge than he could ever have imagined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a tough call. His steel yacht, named British Steel after his main sponsors for that event, pointed into the wind all the time and took a buffeting for months on end.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No-one will ever say that there is no God without my remembering all these situations,&quot; he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To atheists I say: go sailing single-handed for a few weeks. Alone in a fierce sea you feel the ocean is making a determined effort to get you. Man is pitifully small against such gigantic forces. You feel over and over again that it is God's will that you survive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rigours of sailing to weather is appreciated in all sailing circles, from the beginner in Optimist dinghies to the most experienced ocean racers.  The boat's deck is always at an acute angle, the bow is always smashing into the chop and the surf breaks over the bows every time the boat pitches into the dark waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is impossible to stay dry. Gear failures will call the sailor on deck at all times of the night or day, as the strain of sailing uphill often is hard on the hardware.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chay Blyth knows all that and sports the experience. He knows all about the vulnerability, the loneliness - even when surrounded by a crew in cheek by jowl circumstances - and the inherent dangers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Chay keeps busy helping others go through the same rigours in search of self-fulfilment. As safely as possible, too, considering the knowledge he can input in the design and preparation of the yachts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chay is in town after seeing off the fleet of 14 BT Global Challenge yachts on Sunday when they left Cape Town on the penultimate leg of their race around the world, against the rotation of the earth. That is to say, against the prevailing trade winds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second last leg of the race, from here to Boston in the United States, is one of the easier legs. After this the yachts face a relatively short hop across the North Atlantic to finish at Southampton in time for Cowes Week, one of the top sailing regattas held in British waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chay is organiser, race director, planner, shoulder-to-cry-on and advisor of the race skippers and their crews. Above all though, he is their mentor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tough Scotsman with a dry sense of humour which no doubt stood him in good stead during his own voyages, Chay projects an attitude that proclaims nothing is impossible if you put your mind to it. His greatest pleasure in all that he does, though, is to work with people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ordinary people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The best part of this race for me is to work with people,&quot; he said. &quot;To give ordinary people the opportunity to sail like this. You must realise that most of the crews on board these yachts have never sailed before. Once they succeeded in securing their financial support, we trained them from the start, taught them to sail. Even some of the skippers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blyth has sailed in many top order ocean races since his record-setter in British Steel. His vast experience has taught him what he would like to see in this kind of racing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I find it difficult to get excited about these single-handed races in open class boats,&quot; he said. &quot;It usually ends up being an affair which is won by the guy with the biggest budget. Look at that non-stop race of the French, for instance. The winner came in about two thousand miles ahead of the second- placed yacht.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is not racing. That is a display of technology and design. It turns into a parade. That is why we have 14 yachts that are exactly the same, fitted out with the same equipment and crewed by the same class of crew, in most cases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What you get then is a much more competitive event, where the leader is continually under pressure from the boats behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chay is convinced that &quot;his&quot; race will now become a regular. But he doesn't sail in this sort of race himself anymore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, I think I am too old for this now. I am not in the sort of shape to do it. I find sufficient pleasure helping others realise the dream now,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town -Public Enterprises Minister Stella Sigcau has warned the Western Cape and other provincial governments that they may not go ahead with selling state-owned assets in the provinces without consulting national government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Sigcau was responding to plans by the Western Cape government to sell off provincial state assets to fund capital projects, such as the construction of roads and buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finance MEC Kobus Meiring, in his budget speech in the provincial legislature, announced that all unused and costly fixed assets in the province would be sold and the proceeds transferred to a loan fund to bankroll new capital projects.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Western Cape government also plans to rationalise office space in Cape Town saving up to R110 million over three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Meiring has set aside R13 million for 1997/98 to kick start what he called the &quot;most ambitious provincial privatisation programme in South Africa&quot; .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Sigcau warned that any privatisation drive by the Western Cape or any other province, should follow a structured route, approved by national government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;National government has to agree with the route of privatisation taken by the provincial government before privatisation can take place,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Sigcau said national government had laid down strict criteria for the selling off of state assets. She expected the Western Cape government to follow the guidelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An inter-ministerial cabinet committee has already been appointed to oversee all privatisation of state-owned assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said her department would meet soon, preferably next month, with provincial governments to outline the national government's position on the privatisation of provincial state assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national government's preferred method of privatisation was to seek strategic equity partners for each provincial state-owned company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privatisation should also be to the benefit of historically disadvantaged groups in the provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Sigcau said the committee overseeing privatisation had agreed that shares in restructured enterprises should be sold, at a discount, to the National Empowerment Fund (NEF) which would be set up to empower historically disadvantaged communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the national government's intention that funding schemes would be developed with the private sector to enable the disadvantaged to get shares in the NEF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These principles have been accepted by the inter-ministerial cabinet committee and will soon be discussed at the level of the portfolio committee and with labour and other stakeholders,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The African National Congress' most powerful body, the national working committee, has urged all cadres and members eligible for amnesty to apply to the Truth Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty applications by ANC political and military leaders will be submitted to the commission's Cape Town offices by Friday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While not mentioning names, the ANC expanded on its previous decision that leaders of the liberation movement who were eligible for amnesty should do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This included past and present members of the national executive committee, the revolutionary council, former members of the regional political committees, former leaders of the politico-military committees and of self- defence units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Past and present members of the NEC will apply for amnesty in the context of the broad principle of collective responsibility for the conduct of the struggle where their conduct might have resulted in acts, omissions or offences envisaged in the Truth Commission Act,&quot; the national working committee said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC's second submission on military, security and intelligence operations will be made to the Truth Commission on May 12 and 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the commission has delayed the amnesty hearing of one of the killers of American Fulbright scholar Amy Biehl to allow her parents, who live in the United States, to attend, Sapa reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement yesterday, the TRC said Ms Biehl's parents were due to visit South Africa from June. The application would then be heard on July 8 and 9.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The African National Congress is convinced its cadres were not involved in some of the acts of terrorism attributed to it by its political opponents, such as the bombing of Wimpy bars, says Deputy Defence Minister Ronnie Kasrils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ANC acknowledged being responsible for the 1983 Church Street bombing in Pretoria, in which 19 people died and more than 200 were injured; the 1986 Magoo's Bar bombing in Durban; and &quot;at least&quot; a further five or six car-bomb attacks, Mr Kasrils said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also acknowledged the ANC had laid landmines in border areas, which had caused the deaths of white civilians and black farm labourers, but said this practice had been stopped because of the deaths.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kasrils was speaking during a public debate, &quot;The Just War and Reconciliation&quot;, organised by the Truth Commission and held in the Old Town House yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After detailing these actions in response to a question about the ANC's policy regarding &quot;non-combatant&quot; deaths, he said: &quot;And that's about it You can't put all the violence at the door of the ANC and MK (armed wing Umkhonto weSizwe).&quot; The ANC had expressed regret for the lives that had been lost, especially civilian lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For us the end didn't justify the means. We attempted to meet that and we think we did pretty well,&quot; Mr Kasrils said. &quot;Actually, a very small proportion of the action involved civilians, but at the same time we profoundly regret that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constand Viljoen, Freedom Front leader and former chief of the SA Defence Force, argued that neither the former apartheid government nor the liberation movements could pass the full test of having fought a just war - &quot;at least not in the classical sense of this theory&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But let me hasten to remind you that this war, if it could be called war, is so unique that the traditional 'just war' theory cannot easily be applied.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the politicians had failed the SADF, because he had given at least five formal briefings to the Cabinet between 1976 and 1985 in which &quot;good advice&quot; had been given on the need for alternatives to the continuing war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this advice had been ignored on each occasion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Children involved in a school bus crash at Cape Point have told how their fun picnic outing became a nightmare when one of the buses suddenly overturned at Buffels Bay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pupils, from Ridgeville Primary School in Mitchell's Plain, were singing in the packed bus, with many standing in the aisle. But the singing turned to screams and crying as the bus toppled over, said one pupil.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She described the incident as her &quot;worst nightmare come to life&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bus driver has been charged with reckless and negligent driving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A helicopter flew one seriously injured pupil to Constantiaberg Medi-Clinic from the accident, another nine children were rushed to hospital in ambulances, and 36 were taken to hospital in a privately owned bus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four of the pupils, aged between 10 and 12, suffered dangerous back injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A teacher and a parent were also injured when the bus overturned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four school buses on the jaunt had gone down the steep road leading to the picnic site in the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve, apparently in spite of clear signs warning that buses were not allowed on the road. The bus that overturned was the last in the convoy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent statement, the Cape Town City Council said buses may drive down the road to Buffels Bay on weekdays but not on public holidays or at weekends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standard 3 pupil Ilhaam Davids, 10, who was in the bus, said all she could remember was the screams of fellow pupils as the bus overturned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She and her schoolmates had been excited about the outing and had been singing moments before the crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the pupils were standing as there were not enough seats for all of us in the bus. I fell to the floor immediately as the bus toppled over and hurt my back, but not too seriously ... this is what the Metro Rescue doctor told me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody was screaming and crying and the experience was like one of my worst nightmares come to life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deputy director of Metro Rescue Services, Wayne Smith, said emergency units, including the civil defence, fire brigade, the police and army medics were rushed to the scene after initial reports indicated that the incident involved a collision between two buses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thankfully it was not as bad as that and besides four pupils, who suffered quite serious back injuries, most of the other injuries involved scratches and bruises,&quot; Dr Smith said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the injured were taken to False Bay Hospital, where they were treated and given hot soup while waiting for their parents to collect them.  The more seriously injured were taken to Victoria Hospital and by late last night most had been discharged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police were investigating whether the bus was roadworthy, a spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This morning parents and pupils gathered at the school, anxious for information about the children involved in the crash. A school spokesman said they were told as many details as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all the children on the crash bus were at school this morning and by 9am school was dismissed for the day.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - Ladi Olorunyomi, a Nigerian journalist who has worked for the Concord and the Herald newspapers, was released yesterday from the Lagos prison where she had been held without charge since March 20, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has learned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CPJ's Africa program coordinator Kakuna Kerina spearheaded the campaign for her release in collaboration with other international organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Olorunyomi is the wife of exiled Nigerian journalist Dapo Olorunyomi, who was brought safely to asylum in the United States by the joint effort of CPJ and Amnesty International in December 1995, just days after the bombing of his office. Mr. Olorunyomi was editor of Independent Communications Network's &quot;TheNEWS&quot; and &quot;Tempo&quot; news magazines.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government finally gave in to the pressure brought to bear by CPJ and others,&quot; said Mr. Olorunyomi from Washington, where he is a fellow at the Panos Institute. &quot;This shows that campaigns really work. I am profoundly grateful for the help given to my wife and to me by CPJ.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Olorunyomi was arrested on the night of March 20 at her home in Lagos by military intelligence and army officers. They did not remove anything from the premises and gave no reason for her arrest. She was taken to a holding facility in Apapa, where she was detained incommunicado.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CPJ, in conjunction with Amnesty International and Reporteurs sans Frontiers, sought her release. A March 21 letter from CPJ's executive director, William A. Orme, Jr., to Nigeria's ruling leader General Sani Abacha calling for her unconditional release strongly protested her arrest &quot; as a grave and blatant attack on press freedom, journalists, and their families&quot; and a violation of journalists' rights worldwide as guaranteed by Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international covenants and codes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are relieved that Ladi Olorunyomi has been released from her wrongful, unwarranted detention and that she can return home to comfort her two young children,&quot; said Ms. Kerina. &quot;Regrettably, military intelligence is subjecting her to continued injustice by requiring her to report twice weekly to the facility where she was held.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reuters reported today that another journalist, Godwin Agbroko, editor of The Week magazine, who had been detained since December because of reports published by his magazine about disagreements within the ruling military government, was also released.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - A Ghanaian Air Force jet fighter crashed Wednesday as it escorted President Jerry Rawlings's plane which was returning home from Kasane, Botswana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings was in Botswana to attend an international business forum of Southern African leaders.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ghana News Agency reported that the plane crashed into the bush near the air force base in Accra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plane, whose type has not yet been disclosed, went down minutes after it broke formation with the Presidential jet. There was loud a bang followed by a huge ball of flames and thick black plumes of smoke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guards, policemen and dignitaries who had gathered to welcome Rawlings watched in awe as the fighter, after escorting the presidential jet, pulled upwards, rolled on its belly, then nose-dived into the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seconds after the crash, members of the presidential guard and police and some of the dignitaries, including Vice President John Evans Atta Mills, sped across the tarmac and the runway to the crash site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A witness who was in the presidential jet said Rawlings, a former fighter pilot, was the first out of his plane and ran to crash. A Ghana Civil Aviation Authority fire tender sprayed foam into the area where the black smoke was a coming from because it was beyond reach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parts of the aircraft, as well as the body of the pilot, lay strewn meters from site of impact. The larger chunk the body was charred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Air Force Commander T.A. Bruce and aides were seen giving instruction as they collected body parts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials prevented journalists from going to the crash site where bulldozers were frantically clearing a path for fire tenders. Officials also refused to comment on the crash.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - The United States and Ethiopia, erstwhile allies, then enemies, and now friends again are hoping to increase their volume of bilateral business, with a U.S. trade exhibition now underway in Addis Ababa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four-day exhibition, in which 12 co-sponsors are involved, is the second of its kind in the Ethiopian capital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first, organized by the U.  S. Embassy in November 1995, 12,000 people visited the stands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing the growth of the exhibition, U.S. Ambassador to Ethiopia David Shinn said the number of participants had risen from 40 in 1995 to 150 presently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bilateral aspect of the event, he said, demonstrated the importance the U.S attached to its investment in Ethiopia and the flow of trade in both directions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening the exhibition Wednesday, Ethiopian Vice Minister of Trade and Industry Bruk Debebe said Ethiopian-U.S. economic relations had improved significantly since the downfall, in 1991, of the Marxist military regime of Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without giving figures, Bruk said bilateral trade had been rising steadily and that U.S. investment has been increasing most significantly in mining, energy, tourism development.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - African Ministers responsible for economic and social development and planning ended a five-day meeting Thursday with a declaration on accelerating trade and investment in the region, in which they endorsed the role of information and the private sector in Africa's development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the &quot;Declaration on Accelerating Trade and Investment in Africa,&quot; the ministers, who met in Addis Ababa, said they were &quot;convinced that trade and investment are essential components in any credible strategies to accelerate our countries' development and sustain high rates of economic growth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Broadly-based high rates of economic growth geared toward creating employment and generating rising incomes are recognized as essential components for poverty reduction and its eventual eradication.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministers said there was need to boost domestic savings and investment, attract private foreign capital transfers and expand trade with the rest of the world, Africa must change the negative perception of the region as a high- risk place and improve information flow on development in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It must also modernize, expand and diversify production; reduce the cost of establishing business; and strengthen international competitiveness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, they noted that though Africa had created a conducive environment for the expansion of trade with the rest of the world, protectionist policies on the part of others with regard African agricultural, textile and clothing had frustrated that expansion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference endorsed the implementation of the African Information Society Initiative, a framework adopted by ministers in 1996 to build Africa's national information and communications infrastructure. This is seen as a part of a strategy to harness information and communication technologies towards development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welcoming the debt-reduction initiative for highly indebted poor countries, recently proposed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund as a first step in the right direction, the ministers called for additional and more generous resources to reduce substantially &quot;all Africa countries' debt stock.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost of servicing external debt is estimated to have exceeded 340 billion U.S. dollars by the end of 1996.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Five people have been arrested in connection with Wednesday's bomb explosion near an army barracks in Lagos, a Nigerian defence spokesman said Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Col. Godwin Ugbo, the acting director of defence information, said the suspects were arrested in the vicinity of the blast, along Herbert Macauley Street, downtown Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The explosion occurred in front of Masrda Army Barracks, causing minor damage to a military truck and buildings in the area.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ugbo confirmed there were no deaths but at least five people were injured, including soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the injured soldiers, among them a woman, were treated at a military hospital in Yaba and discharged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses said the explosion narrowly missed a 25-seater military bus, the apparent target. The bus was heading for Lagos island from the northern city suburb of Ikeja.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos State Police Commissioner Abubakar Tsav said investigations had been launched into the incident, the sixth in the city in the last seven months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An explosion in November 1996 killed Olushola Omoshola, the chief security officer of Murtala Muhammed International Airport, in Lagos, and two others in his car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 16 that year, the Lagos state administrator, Col. Mohammed Warwa, escaped unhurt after another blast hit two vehicles in his convoy, injuring three persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days later, another bomb rocked a bus conveying members of a task-force on environmental sanitation to work. Some 16 persons, mainly soldiers, were injured in that explosion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 7, 1997, a device exploded at the Ojuelegba area, killing two soldiers and injuring many others, while another explosion went off in Maryland in February. All but one of the explosions were targeted at the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police have blamed the prodemocracy groups, especially the National Democratic Coalition, or Nadeco, for the explosions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sixteen people have been charged with alleged terrorism in connection with the bombings. Four of the accused, including Nigeria's exiled Nobel literature laureate, Wole Soyinka, are being tried in absentia. The offence carries the death sentence on conviction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - General Magnus Malan has confirmed his allegation in Parliament in February 1990 that murdered Swapo lawyer Anton Lubowski was a South African spy paid by the SADF's Military Intelligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the Truth Commission he stood by his claim, but that he no longer had documentary proof as this had been given to the Harms Commission.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the official inquest into Mr Lubowski's death, headed by Namibian judge Mr Justice Levy in 1994, there was prima facie evidence that several members of the SADF's Civil Co-operation Bureau (CCB) had been directly involved in the murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Malan said he had not read the inquest report and could not comment on this. Later, when he was asked to confirm a report in the Cape Argus quoting him telling Parliament that Mr Lubowski had been a paid spy and that he had done &quot;good work&quot; for the SADF, General Malan said the report sounded a correct version of what he had said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission deputy chairman Alex Boraine put it to General Malan that it was &quot;a very strong allegation&quot;, which also affected Mr Lubowski's family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Malan said: &quot;I feel very sorry for that family, make no mistake about it, but I have to reply to questions.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His revelation came in response to a question by commission chairman Desmond Tutu about what he had meant by authorising &quot;disruption&quot; of the forces of the liberation movements.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Malan replied that such disruption had never included killing, and that it had referred to action against Umkhonto weSizwe (MK) soldiers and not political leaders and activists. He then gave the capture and release of Mr Nujoma as an example of how it would have been counter-productive to have targeted a leader.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - General Magnus Malan has told the commission he does not intend applying for amnesty for cross-border raids by the SADF and operations in which innocent civilians died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said he would consider a suggestion by commission deputy chairman Alex Boraine that he should apply because he may have contravened international law by admitting he ordered such operations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his testimony over more than two hours, followed by more than three hours of questions, General Malan said: &quot;As a professional soldier, I issued orders, and later as minister of defence I authorised orders which led to the death of innocent civilians in cross-fire. I sincerely regret the civilian casualties, but unfortunately this is part of the ugly reality of war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring specifically to cross-border raids, General Malan said he considered these operations to have been lawful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cross-border raids cause bloodshed. As a Christian I regret the loss of life. I, however, do not intend to seek amnesty for those operations,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Boraine told General Malan the killing of innocent civilians was defined as a gross human rights violation under international law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I say with great respect that you may be placing yourself in some jeopardy - would you not consider the need for applying for amnesty?&quot; Dr Boraine asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Malan said all that commanders could do was &quot;be horrified&quot; by civilian deaths and try to prevent them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's all I can say Thanks for your good advice (about applying for amnesty), I will consider it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The SA Defence Force's chemical and biological warfare programme never had &quot;sinister connotations&quot; and President Mandela had approved its continuation after being fully briefed, General Malan told the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme, code-named Project Coast, had been directed at developing &quot; effective counter-measures&quot; against the chemical and biological threat posed by the Soviet and Cuban forces in Angola.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It had been approved by him in 1981 &quot;at a stage when the Republic of South Africa possessed no chemical or biological capability and could not rely on the assistance of any major power for assistance should such threats materialise,&quot; the former defence minister testified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Malan gave the Truth Commission a &quot;top-secret&quot; document from then brigadier Dr Wouter Basson, dated March 16, 1990, and requesting financial approval for amended procedures for the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it was &quot;interesting&quot; to note that the secret Basson document failed to report &quot;any sinister motive or intention of killing people&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have been informed that the members responsible for the project briefed President Mandela fully on the existence, scope and ambit of Project Coast and that he thereafter granted his approval for its continuation,&quot; General Malan told the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the document, there were four &quot;sub-projects&quot; of Project Coast: Bluet, Kassa, Rod and Chancelor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The total costs of the project in 1985-86 were R28,79-million, and in the following years, to 1989-90, respectively R27,34-million, R32,9-million, R45, 46-million and R31,7-million.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - General Magnus Malan told the Truth Commission he had authorised the establishment of the Civil Co-operation Bureau (CCB) as a component of the South African Defence Force special forces, but had been unaware of hit squad activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said in Cape Town yesterday he that he had been unaware that the CCB's &quot; Region Six&quot; - members of which were implicated in the murders of Swapo lawyer Anton Lubowski and Witwatersrand University academic David Webster, among others - had been activated.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was quite surprised,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the commission that the special forces had been an integral and supportive part of the SADF and that the role of the CCB had been envisaged as &quot;the infiltration and penetration of the enemy, the gathering of information and the disruption of the enemy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;The CCB was approved as an organisation consisting of 10 divisions or 'regions', as expressed in military jargon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Eight of these divisions or regions were intended to refer to geographical areas. The area of one of these regions, Region Six, referred to the Republic of South Africa. &quot;The fact that the organisation in Region Six was activated came to my knowledge for the first time in November 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The CCB provided the SA Defence Force with good covert capabilities,&quot; General Malan said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The national party is reeling after leader FW de Klerk's shock decision to disband the task team looking into the party's future</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Party was always going to have a difficult time after losing power in the 1994 elections. It was, after all, the party that had inflicted the grossest of human rights abuses on the citizens of the country it had governed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Revelations on the extent of those abuses has not helped the NP's cause since then. Even the most myopic of South Africans will now be aware of the horrors visited upon the country by the NP's earlier manifestations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To survive, the NP had, therefore, to cast off all traces of the past.  Party leader FW de Klerk turned to Roelf Meyer, perhaps the most enlightened of the party's younger guard, for solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meyer probed three options: the forming of an alliance; the forming of an election pact; and the creation of a new &quot;umbrella&quot; movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears the mere whisper of the third of these options - which would effectively require the party to disband - set off alarm bells among party leaders, particularly those that might be characterised as the old guard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today Meyer is paying the price. His task team has been disbanded without any indication where he may be going. It will be a body blow to the &quot;verligte&quot; ranks of the party if Meyer is forced into the political wilderness and would follow the loss of the likes of Leon Wessels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tomorrow the NP could be paying the price. There is little chance, given the reality of politics in South Africa at present, that the party will be able to form alliances or pacts without the enlightened thinkers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, it is likely to discover in the months to come that the best solution will be to disband. The alternative would be a slow death, as last experienced by the United Party.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Eight years ago an Eastern Cape woman, Elda Mahlentle, was so overwhelmed by the plight of children living a life of degradation and deprivation in Western Cape squatter camps that she was inspired to open a school for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her mercy and kindness indirectly cost her the lives of her husband, daughter and a granddaughter during the &quot;witdoeke wars&quot;. But in spite of these tragedies she courageously and unselfishly continued her work because she had a driving ambition - to bring the light of education to communities living in darkness in the squatter camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As you go into Marconi Beam squatter camp near Milnerton, a bumpy, dusty road leads to a skewed row of scores of rusty wood-and-iron shacks. The only thing that differentiates Elda's home from the others is the name &quot;Zizamele Mampinga&quot; (&quot;Try hard&quot; Mampinga, the last being her clan name) painted prominently outside.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside the shack is a well-built woman of average height in her 60s who welcomes people with a broad smile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elda was born in Stutterheim in the former Ciskei in 1934. The last of 10 children, she completed her Junior Certificate in 1953, after which she did a two-year teachers' training diploma in Blythswood in the Transkei. She could not get work as a teacher and so joined the staff of the Frere Hospital in East London, where she trained as a nurse for one year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1957 she came to Cape Town and worked in a Robben Island hospital where she met a policeman, who became her husband. After passing a course in midwifery at Woodstock Hospital in 1962, Elda returned to her home in Transkei.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She returned to Cape Town in 1973 and for the next 12 years she was jobless.  In 1985 she got a job as a social worker for one year for the Roman Catholic Church in Old Crossroads - and it was here she found her mission in life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My heart was touched by hundreds of children who were loitering in the streets with nothing to do,&quot; she said. &quot;They could not find a place in a local primary school because it was full to capacity. Many of them had come from Transkei for holidays. Their parents, most of whom worked on farms, did not have enough money to bring them back home. They were being exposed to crime and other dangers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the permission of the church, Elda opened a school in 1988.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I started with 516 children and I was the only teacher,&quot; she said. &quot;We used a shack which served as a church hall and which had no roof. Other classes had to be conducted in the shade of a tree. The children were divided into four classes - sub-A to Standard Two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I advertised on radio and got one teacher after a week and later another.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then tragedy struck. Elda's husband and granddaughter were burnt to death in the violent &quot;war&quot; in Crossroads between the Witdoeke and the Comrades.  Elda sought refuge in the nearby New Crossroads and the school closed down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June 1990, she was persuaded to return by the leader of a youth group, who told her the children were suffering. She opened a creche in Section Four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was the time when the fighting between the two groups was hotting up,&quot; she said. &quot;Children who lived in Section Four could not go to school in the rival Section Three because they were beaten up and shot at. I took classes up to Standard Two and had to accommodate other children who could not go to school because of the war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1991 Elda's daughter was shot dead and she was forced to flee the chaos in 'rossroads and re-settle in Marconi Beam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My life was in danger,&quot; she said. &quot;I had no other option. Life has taught me that you don't only become an enemy doing what is wrong, but you can also become one by doing good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Marconi Beam she found the same desperate situation - children walking about the streets with nothing to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It broke my heart to see girls and boys of school-going age dancing in shebeens,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She talked to parents and discovered there were many children who wanted to go to school but did not know where to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I got assistance from Zimasa Primary School in Langa township which offered to take some children. We arranged for lower fares with Golden Arrow buses, and the children went to school,&quot;said Elda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then it transpired that many children were not going to school because their parents, most of whom were unemployed, had no money for bus fares. &quot;So in1993, I opened a school from Sub A to Standard Five here in Marconi Beam.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The community named the school Elda Mahlentle Primary School in her honour.  It has gone from strength to strength in spite of the fact that it has had to be rebuilt several times after being destroyed in fires that have swept Marconi Beam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It now has12 classes from Sub A to Standard 7. The classrooms are metal ships' containers donated by various companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And with a growing demand for schooling from the elderly, Elda, with the help of the community, opened a night school for literacy classes from Sub A to Standard 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year a number of elderly people, some on walking sticks, graduated and received certificates for the first time in their lives.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town -The Department of Trade and Industry is to start a drive to boost women's participation in small businesses, according to Alistair Ruiters of the department's Small Business Promotion Centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech to this week's International Conference on Women in Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises at the University of Stellenbosch's Centre for Entrepreneurship, Dr Ruiters said the department had set up a gender forum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was designed to make women's access easier to all the programmes and incentives run by the department.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An annual work plan had just been finalised, Dr Ruiters said, and &quot;very soon&quot; this would be translated into actions which would make a &quot;lasting impact&quot; on the role of women in small business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The structure of business ownership in South Africa illustrates the daunting challenge that faces women,&quot; Dr Ruiters said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seventy-two percent of micro businesses were owned by women, 36 percent of sewing or clothing businesses, 9,4 percent of manufacturing enterprises and 0, 5 percent of building and construction businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strategies which did not tackle the specific needs of women ran the risk of failure, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women in rural areas faced unique challenges, while all over the country, traditional stereotypes and attitudes towards women blocked their access to opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In most cases, women will not have assets to put down as security in order to access finance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is common practice to expect them to gain approval from their partners in order to access opportunities, &quot; Dr Ruiters said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In most households, they are always expected to make more sacrifices to keep their families happy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there is a tendency to expect women to demonstrate superwoman qualities in order to gain recognition,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government had targeted women for support in its small business promotion strategy, channelled through agencies such as Ntsika, which provided non-financial support, and Khula, for financial support. Apart from the Centre for Small Business Promotion in the department, and the National Small Business Council set up as a watchdog for small business interests, small business desks had been set up in each province's economic affairs department, Dr Ruiters said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Problems such as lack of self-confidence, fear of failure and low self- esteem among women can be attributed to both historical and societal pressures under which women have been and must continue to operate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No amount of external interventions by the Government or private sector can successfully eradicate these without the determination and a concerted effort on the part of women themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The Hollywoodian fizzle of the archetypal Olympic Games of the past two decades, hyped to the nines, brash and brassy, has worn a little thin as a model for the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The air of excess, the expense, the commercialism - these things have come to be regarded as inimical to the ideals that are meant to instil faith in the wholesomeness of Olympism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year's event in Atlanta was possibly the apotheosis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Driven almost entirely by private enterprise, it was the biggest commercial event in the 100-year history of the modern Olympic movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics said the organisers overdid the commercialism, selling sponsors the right to put the Olympic rings on everything from game shows to hamburgers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Feats of endurance and record-breaking achievements in the sports arenas were matched by a merchandising bonanza of mind-boggling proportions on the streets outside, attended, unsurprisingly, by a certain queasiness, a sense that the Olympics was less about taking part and struggling well (the precepts at the heart of the Olympic movement) than making the most bucks by the easiest means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea that the Olympic spirit is just another saleable item is tacky. It makes the IOC itself look a bit tacky, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is why Cape Town's plan for 2004 is especially appealing to the influential grandees touring the world to find the best site for the Games after Sydney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town's proposal is quite different from those of its rivals - Rome, Athens and Stockholm in Europe, and Buenos Aires across the ocean in South America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a start, it is what, in business-speak, is called a &quot;right-sized&quot; event, a realistically modest proposal, about half the size of the Atlanta Games and tailored to South Africa's economic capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, the considerable public-sector component of the budget will effectively prevent, or obviate the need for, the kind of rampant commercialism that a wholly private-sector affair cultivates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And both the capital and operating budgets, fully underwritten by the national government, carry substantial contingency reserves that provide financial security, and allow a pragmatic degree of flexibility as the project unfolds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In adding a fourth &quot;developmental&quot; pillar to the traditional three pillars of Ol-ympism - sport, culture, environment - the Cape Town plan comes into its own as an instrument of good and a symbolic opportunity for the IOC to redeem and reinvigorate the ideals of Olympism and refresh its own image, through a unique, and genuinely consequential landmark event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This occurs on three levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The least tangible is the impact the bid will have - and already is having - on the nature of Cape Town as a city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's planners have inherited a warped, inefficient, and costly urban matrix shaped by the unjust and impractical dictates of apartheid ideology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political reforms have overtaken, but not redressed, the myriad deficiencies in the physical make-up of the city and, unless they are tackled, the social and economic costs will mount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Olympic plan on its own, especially given its modest scope, is not to be regarded as the ultimate panacea, but it is already proving to be the most significant catalyst the city has seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is being used effectively to &quot;seed&quot; new development where it's most needed, re-focus transport and land-use planning, and provide tight time- frames for the achievement of realistic developmental goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The creation of Olympic, or sporting, facilities is only one by-product of the overall scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are being strategically located to stimulate new business and service opportunities which, in the absence of the Olympic projects, would not have a foundation on which to grow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coupled with this is a deliberate stratagem to spread the benefits equitably, to ensure that contracts and projects will help small and emergent businesses gain a foothold in the economic mainstream, and provide advantage to previously disadvantaged communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this way, the developmental pillar of the bid is intended as a means of practical empowerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in macro-economic terms, one is looking at an event that has the potential to raise the Gross Domestic Product of southern Africa by one percent a year for 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The predicted growth for South Africa is R30-billion over 10 years, with additional tax revenue of R8-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The job-creation potential is immense - between 90 000 and 100 000 permanent jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And contrary to the arguments trotted out - this week again - by the abysmally ill-informed, anti-bid lobby, these are not merely jobs on Olympic stadium construction sites, or jobs that will end once the athletes pack up and go home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are genuinely permanent jobs in tourism and all the industries that feed off it. In effect, these cover the entire spectrum of the economy from agriculture and food production to manufacturing, financial services and commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However you look at it, it's an impressive impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Ball likes to illustrate the point in another way. He says you could put the Olympic Games in London and the Gross Domestic Product of Britain would hardly reflect it.The British capital already attracts visitors in their millions, and foreign investment on a bewildering scale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without having to say it in so many words, the real point is that if you really want to make a difference to the lives of millions of people, and positively influence the future of a city, a country, a whole continent, don't put the Games in yet another European capital (read Rome, Athens, Stockholm), where the impact will be barely evident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the sense that the African bid really is an opportunity to show that Olympism need not be overblown and overly commercial and can be inspirational that is, by all accounts, being appreciated by visiting IOC members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the right bid for the right time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With less than four months to go before the September 5 vote, getting this message across, personally, to as many IOC members as possible, is the bid team's priority. It is difficult to judge accurately, but it seems to be making its mark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In tandem with this, there are a number of other initiatives under way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mandela and his deputy Thabo Mbeki are living up to their promise to campaign for the bid more visibly, and to do all they can to allay what is on the face of it an irrational concern on the part of some in the IOC about the prospects of political stability in a post-Mandela setting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa is not immune to Afro-pessimism, and this is a reflection of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tackling the other key concern - crime - is the goal of an unusual and risky initiative launched last week by the Cape Town Community Olympic Forum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is founded on the idea that if it is possible to secure peace accords between gangs, and between gangs and society as a first step towards drawing gangsters into a peaceable existence in the mainstream, then crime and violence will be dramatically reduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Achilles heel of the initiative is the exclusion of drug dealing from the accords, so that while gangsters may well reduce violent crime by virtue of ceasing the ir own criminally violent activities, they are not going as far as ceasing to be criminals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a view that the bid is working with criminals in an unholy alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can one fault that view? Of course, the forum is independent from the bid, so it is not technically a bid initiative. That aside, forum chairman Brian Williams does contest the negative view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He argues that everything else has been tried, and has failed. He argues, too, that if the problem of gang warfare is to be seriously tackled, then the gangsters must somehow be engaged. What better way, he feels, than to give gangs a measure of responsibility to prove their bona fides, and to be given the chance to take the first step away from crime by themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time will tell whether this novel approach bears fruit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lingering weakness in the bid as a whole is, of course, the apathy, the careless inertia, in which too many of Cape Town's often most influential residents invest a perverse pride.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is spurred on by the effete and tiresome bluster of commentators who ought to know better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no doubt there are legitimate concerns, but it is doubtful any of the most vocal detractors has bothered to establish whether they are being addressed or not, how and by whom. If they did, they would find a level of planning, expertise, vigilance and concern in the broader bid team which far exceeds their own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African National Congress MP Willie Hofmeyr made the point succinctly this week when he said: &quot;I must emphasise that it is good to be sceptical about the Olympic bid - as some people are - but let us try to stick to the facts.  It would be sad if we threw away a huge opportunity for our country because of prejudice rather than fact.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he added that &quot;it is quite wrong to argue that the money spent on the Olympics could be better spent on education, housing and other social needs.  Without the Olympics, the money simply would not be there to spend&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the crux of it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Pagad national commander Aslam Toefy has threatened to &quot; mobilise the masses&quot; against Cape Town's Olympic Bid if it continues to associate with known gangsters such as Rashied Staggie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a People against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad) meeting at Spes Bona High School in Athlone last night, Mr Toefy said although Pagad was not against the city hosting the 2004 Olympic Games, it would oppose the bid if it was promoted in this way.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There can be no Olympics without the people and liberation hasn't reached us yet. Pagad is going to bring about true liberation, justice and dignity for our people,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Toefy said the Olympics must benefit the oppressed masses in the Western Cape, and children should be given every chance to develop and have a fair chance to take part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But gangsterism and drugs would prevent them from being able to rise to the occasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Olympic Peace Initiative signed by gangsters who said they had reformed, led by Mr Staggie, and the Community Olympic Forum, was a scam to pull the wool over the eyes of people on the Cape Flats who yearned for peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pagad member Madelief Botha said the &quot;marriage&quot; between Brian Williams of the Community Olympic Forum and Mr Staggie had been made in hell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She blamed the current political climate for allowing known gangsters to sit on a public platform without making a commitment to stop selling drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">n Mr Williams was wrongly associated with the Community Outreach Forum in a caption on yesterday's Cape Argus Attitudes page.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The National Party stands on the brink of disintegration after crisis talks yesterday between party leader</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">F W de Klerk and the movement's provincial leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the talks Mr De Klerk took the surprise step of disbanding the NP taskforce aimed at bringing about a new political alignment, saying it was creating tensions in the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The taskforce was headed by the party's foremost reformist and its Gauteng leader, Roelf Meyer, who has been at the centre of bitter infighting for more than a year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A clearly unhappy Mr Meyer said last night that he would &quot;reconsider&quot; his options, and the party's Gauteng Youth leader, Paulo Andrade, said he would review his position in the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both have urged the NP to consider the option of disbanding as a prelude to the emergence of a new political movement - an option rejected earlier this week by the party's federal executive after angry exchanges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nats' Western Cape leader, Hernus Kriel, who has emerged as one of Mr Meyer's strongest critics, welcomed Mr De Klerk's announcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there was seething discontent in NP ranks in Gauteng, where the provincial head committee is to meet on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NP now faces two no-win options: it can continue as it has since it lost power to the African National Congress, or it can continue to seek a new political alignment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it pursues the new alignment option, it will quickly face a hard and unchangeable fact which Mr Meyer and his supporters have encountered in their months of consultations - other political groups of consequence have insisted that the NP would have to disband before any new movement could emerge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it goes for the stay-as-we-are option, it can have little hope of further growth and virtually no hope of ever becoming a serious rival to the ANC-led alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latter course would leave the NP in the Western Cape as the only viable provincial division of the party, and there has been strong speculation - conceded by Mr Meyer and others in the party - that it could break away if the rest of the NP decided to disband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most important parties Mr Meyer has held discussions with on a new alignment, the Democratic Party, spelled out the NP dilemma today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DP leader Tony Leon said Mr De Klerk had delivered &quot;a silver bullet to the heart of the NP&quot; and added: &quot;Before others can make common cause with enlightened democratic members of that party, the NP must disband.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Leon said only the anti-defection clause in the constitution preserved the NP's unity and it was certain the NP would disappear in its present form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another group with which Mr Meyer has negotiated, the National Consultative Forum headed by former Transkei leader Bantu Holomisa, has also urged the NP to disband.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Former defence minister Magnus Malan has told the Truth Commission he never ordered, or was party to, the assassination of political opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He questioned the authenticity of a report compiled by the then SA Police and SA Defence Force recommending that five Renamo (Mozambican National Resistance) members be eliminated because they were a potential political embarrassment to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Malan, the former head of the SADF and minister of defence in the cabinet of President P W Botha, was testifying voluntarily yesterday before a panel of commissioners and their investigators in Cape Town.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He declined to comment on a top-secret report in the possession of the commission, extracts of which were read to him, in which it was recommended that five Renamo members suspected of murdering their secretary-general, Orlando Cristina, on a Defence Force farm near Pretoria in April 1983, should be assassinated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SADF was at the time secretly supplying Renamo with weapons and other equipment to wage war against Samora Machel's Frelimo government in Mozambique. The five were reported to have become a potential danger to South Africa because of their knowledge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of them, Boaventura Bomba, was a relative of Lieutenant Adriano Francisco Bomba, a Mozambican pilot who defected to South Africa in his MiG 17 fighter in 1981. The pilot was subsequently killed, reportedly also by Renamo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four-man panel that made the recommendation in the report consisted of two policemen - one the officer investigating Mr Cristina's death - and two senior Defence Force officers, one of whom was controversial surgeon and chemical weapons expert Wouter Basson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Basson, now facing charges of dealing in drugs, was fired from the SADF by then President F W de Klerk as part of a purge of senior officers allegedly involved in unauthorised covert operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he was subsequently re-employed in controversial circumstances by the present National Defence Force after allegedly trying to sell details of South Africa's chemical weapons programme to Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Malan acknowledged that he had been told about Mr Cristina's murder while he was minister of defence, but said that he had been told the issue had been handed to Renamo &quot;to decide on, or words to that effect&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had never seen the secret document referred to and would not have approved it if he had.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see it's not signed. Is it an official document?&quot; he asked. &quot;I'd like to read the document fully. I'd like to know who the author was. I'd like to know how authentic this document is.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The Truth and Reconciliation has opened special amnesty &quot; hotlines&quot; in its offices to handle calls from people wanting to apply for amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People wanting to make inquiries about amnesty applications can call the following numbers during working hours this week:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town: 021- 26-2028, or 24-5161 (switchboard)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durban: 031- 3052678, or 031-307-6767 (switchboard)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg: 011-333-1425, or 333-6330 (switchboard).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final deadline for the receipt of amnesty applications is Saturday May 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law establishing the Truth and Reconciliation Commission gives those responsible for acts, omissions or offences which might lead to criminal prosecutions or civil actions for damages the opportunity to apply for amnesty if their actions were associated with political objectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archbishop Desmond Tutu has issued a national appeal to people right across the political spectrum to &quot;take this golden opportunity to apply for amnesty on the most generous terms possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the moment we have about 5500 amnesty applications registered in our database, but more have been received. Nearly 60 applications which involve gross human rights violations have been heard in public, while about 787 have been dealt with in chambers. Altogether 39 people have been granted amnesty and 797 denied. Many of these were from people who applied for actions which does not fall in the TRC's mandate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The state of information development in Africa is characterized by lack or poor quality of data, weak or inadequate telecommunications systems, lack of a critical mass of trained personnel and laws and regulations that impede information flows, a senior United Nations said here today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">K.Y. Amoako, United Nations Under-Secretary General and Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) made this remark in an address to the beginning of 7th Meeting of the Coordinating Committee on African Statistical Development (CASD).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With ECA as its Secretariat, CASD was established in 1992 as an inter-agency committee to &quot;coordinate and direct efforts to revitalize and develop&quot; African statistical systems following the complete loss of infrastructure and disintegration of some statistical services in the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Morocco, Mozambique, South Africa and Uganda represent African Member States in CASD with Afristat, Eurostat, UK-ODA, US Bureau of the Census, World Bank, UN statistical Division, Institut national de la statistique et des etudes economiques, Statistics Sweden as the multilateral and bilateral component.  The Institute of Applied Economics (ISAE), Makerere University, Ecole Nationale Superieure de Statistique et d'Economie Appliquee de Ctte d'Ivoire stand in for African regional training centres.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An integral part of the Addis Ababa Plan of Action for Statistical Development in 1990s adopted by the African Planners, Statisticians and Demographers in 1990, CASD is also an implementation mechanism for the Plan of Action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having dissolved its sub-committees at its 6th Meeting in March 1996, CASD is at a cross-roads. On the table for discussion is an ECA initiative to replace Task Forces for the old sub-committees that managed training; research, methods and standards; data processing and organisation and management of National Statistical Systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Task Forces would develop:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Connectivity of CASD members; 2. Electronics Data Processing (EDP) capability for African countries; 3. Promotion of gender desegregated data in Africa; 4. Measurement and Monitoring of poverty in Africa;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strengthening of the Statistical Training Programme for Africa (STPA) Centres and establishment of an African Household Data/ Archive Service Centre are also to come within the mandate of the Task Forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assuring the meeting of ECA's commitment as it performs its role as a &quot;catalyst in driving forward the statistical agenda in Africa as a central issue of the information services and development&quot;, K.Y. Amoako added that the CASD secretariat should be &quot;enabled to function more effectively in addressing the priority needs of coordination and facilitating the implementation of the Addis Ababa Plan of Action&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A burning issue on the Committee's agenda is the mobilization of resources. Aware that the United Nations Regular Budget and Regular Programme Support for Technical Assistance were unlikely to rise to the occasion because of the United Nations financial crisis, ECA has tabled fresh solutions to CASD's financial crunch:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Taking advantage of UNDP's Support Services for Policy and Programme Development (SSPPD)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Changes have taken place in UNDP after the evaluation of the 5th UNDP Programme Cycle. The agency has recognized the coordinative role of regional policy support and has recently changed policy by including the Regional Commissions for funding under SSPPD. UNDP's change of tack affords Regional Commissions the opportunity to &quot;focus mainly on upstream work to support national and regional programme development&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Tapping funding agencies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This would entail an active review of funding agencies' policies, particularly with regard to sectoral decision making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Establishment of a specific Statistics Development Fund under the United Nations Trust Fund for African Development</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ECA has ear-marked some activities for which funding could be considered:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(a) Needs Assessment and strategy development (b) Monitoring the implementation of the Plan of Action at national and regional levels (c) Management training for Directors of national statistical services (d) Improving methodologies for collection, processing, analysis and dissemination of data</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting could well add some other activities. In this connection K.Y Amoako said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As partners in statistical development, we welcome new proposals from you regarding the strengthening of statistical activities in Africa&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - A United Nations trade body singled out Zimbabwe on Friday as one of several countries in sub-Sahara Africa which is benefiting from a liberalized economy by attracting huge inflows of Foreign Direct Investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other countries enjoying renewed foreign investor interest included Botswana, Morocco, Nigeria and South Africa, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, or Unctad, said in its recently released directory on World Investment in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency said most of the foreign inflows, amounting to 4.5 billion U.S.  dollars, had been mainly in the services and financial sector. Intra-regional investment was also rising on the back of increased realization of the benefits of increasing trade and economic cooperation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although still modest in absolute terms, FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) flows to Africa are responsible for a significant share of gross domestic capital formation and gross domestic product,&quot; Unctad said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign direct investment, it said, represented 4.8 percent of capital formation &quot;approaching levels recorded in Asia and Western Europe&quot; and 10 percent of GDP, compared with about 13 percent in other parts of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Countries which had been traditionally open to foreign direct investment, such as Zimbabwe and Kenya, it said, had liberalized their regulatory frameworks to attract more investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To take advantage of investor interest, Unctad said many countries were concluding bilateral treaties on investment and trade. The agency said that this new phenomenon would benefit future investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe's investment drive, which started in earnest in 1991, has, so far, yielded several million-dollar projects in the manufacturing, tourism and mining sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The single largest project, so far, is the 272-million-dollar platinum mine project near Harare, being implemented by Australian companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, a Malaysian company and a local partner are preparing to implement the first phase of a 1.3-billion-dollar 15-year Industrial Park project 15 kilometers east of Harare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1996 alone, foreign investment reached nearly 91 million dollars, expected to create at last 12,000 jobs over a five-year period.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The chief executive of Barclays Bank Zimbabwe Ltd, Isaac Takawira, warned Friday that bank lending rates could rise again in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the Zimbabwe Inter-Africa News Agency, or Ziana, that with money rates on an upward swing, and inflation expected to rise further, it was inevitable lending rates would be increased.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts warned this week that monetary policy would be have to be tightened further as evidence showed inflation targets set by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe could not be met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The major cause of the rise in inflation, other than the growth in money supply, was the expected spate of administered price hikes in the next few months. These would dash the reserve bank's inflation target of 19-21 percent by June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Takawira said treasury bill rates were rising, so were other money market rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This will inevitably affect lending rates,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The treasury bills went to over 22 percent Thursday, he said, and had gone up by about 4 percent in the last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commercial banks cut lending rates by about three percentage points six weeks ago following a similar reduction in the reserve bank's rediscount rate to 23.5 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to analysts, an increase in the rediscount rate would inevitably result in tightening of lending rates, further increasing the cost of money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That alone would help curb demand for credit by the private sector, which in 1996 soared by 29 percent compared with the previous year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUBUMBASHI, Zaire (PANA) - South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said Friday his talks with Laurent Kabila, to prepare for a second round face-to- face discussions between the rebel leader and ailing Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko, were successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told reporters at the Lubumbashi Airport that Kabila assured him that the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (Zaire), which has almost captured the entire country, was willing to attend the talks proposed for Wednesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the venue for the talks has not yet been agreed on by the warring parties. Nonetheless, Mbeki said that the meetings will take place on a South African naval ship, just as were the first face-to-face meeting between the two rivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila and Mobutu met last week on the South African navy supply ship, the Outeniqua, under the chairmanship of South African President Nelson Mandela.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUBUMBASHI, Zaire (PANA) - A United States mining company, America Mineral Fields Inc., says it has signed contracts of 21 billion U.S. dollars with the rebel Alliance Of Democratic Forces For the Liberation of Congo (Zaire), under which it will work with the local Gecamines Company to mine zinc at Kipushi and copper at Kolwezi in the southern Shaba region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal was disclosed by the company's director of finance, Earl Young, who arrived in Lubumbashi on Friday, leading a group of international financiers interested in investing in Zaire's mining industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young told PANA in Lubumbashi that the contract was part of his company's program to expand mining activity in Zaire and neighboring countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said America Mineral Fields Inc. had also won an exploration contract for minerals in the Solwezi area in north-western Zambia, close to the Zairian Kipushi zinc mine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young said that satellite pictures of the Zambian site indicated the presence of minerals, possibly copper, cobalt or zinc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that if the Zambian reserves proved viable, the company would consider the launching of cross-border mining projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young's group of financiers have come to examine further prospects of investment in Zaire's vast mineral industry, which includes copper and cobalt in Shaba, diamonds in Kasai and the Kivu provinces, and gold in various parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These areas are now in the control of Kabila's forces, whose minister of mines, Florent Kambale Kabila Mututulo, told PANA Friday in Lubumbashi that the new government intended to woo foreign investment to the mining industry to help rehabilitate operations and increase production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the country's mining industry was operating at only 10 percent capacity and that full production could be achieved within the next two years under the current re-investment program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila's alliance accuses Mobutu's regime of running down the country's mining industry which he allegedly used as a source of personal wealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mututulo said the alliance had started compiling figures of mineral production in the country by the government-owned Gecamines and other companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, Kabila sacked the Mobutu-appointed chief executive of Gecamines, as part of the program to resuscitate the country's mining industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila's forces, who are fighting to remove Mobutu from 32 years of power, last week captured the southern Shaba region, the heart of Zaire's mining industry.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - African Ministers responsible for economic and social development and planning ended a 5-day meeting at the headquarters of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) with a set of resolutions and a declaration on accelerating trade and investment in the region in which they strongly endorsed the role of information and the private sector in Africa's development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 'Declaration on Accelerating Trade and Investment in Africa' clearly sets out its purpose, saying: &quot;We are convinced that trade and investment are essential components in any credible strategies to accelerate our countries' development and sustain high rates of economic growth&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Declaration comes out strongly in favour of partnership with the private sector in general and Transnational Corporations (TNCs) in particular as a policy choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Broadly-based high rates of economic growth geared towards creating employment and generating rising incomes are recognized as essential components for poverty reduction and its eventual eradication.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Declaration stresses that to boost domestic savings and investment, attract private foreign capital transfers and expand trade with the rest of the world Africa must, among other things:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(a) change the negative perception of Africa as a high-risk place; (b) improve information flow on development in Africa; (c) modernize, expand and diversify production; (d) reduce the cost of establishing business; and (e) strengthen international competitiveness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It takes the Uruguay Round Agreement in its stride by noting that it offers Africa both challenges and opportunities. It however goes on to point out that, though Africa has created a conducive environment for trade expansion with the rest of the world, protectionist policies on the part of others with regard to African agricultural, textile and clothing have frustrated that expansion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welcoming the debt-reduction initiative for highly indebted poor countries (HIPCs) recently proposed by the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a first step in the right direction, the Declaration calls for additional and more generous resources to &quot;substantially reduce all Africa countries's debt stock&quot;. The cost of servicing external debt is estimated to have exceeded US$340 billion by the end of 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference -- which met from 5 to 8 May -- came out decisively in favour of implementing the African Information Society Initiative (AISI), a framework adopted by ministers in 1996 to build Africa's national information and communications infrastructure as a part of a strategy to harness information and communication technologies towards development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The next step is for African governments in implementing aspects of AISI at national level,&quot; said Nancy Hafkin, ECA's AISI focal point. &quot;We at ECA are going to be placing emphasis on action-oriented interventions and are here to work, with our partners, to assist African governments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Key attention was given to the role information and communications technologies in promoting trade and investment in a major symposium -- organised by ECA together with the Global Information Infrastructure Commission (GIIC). The symposium was broadcast live by satellite on Multichoice DSTV by MNET Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An executive summary of the GIIC Statement of Addis Ababa is attached below.  A full version -- as well as the full text of the Declaration on Accelerating Trade and Investment in Africa -- is distributed under separate e-mail cover.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GIIC Statement of Addis Ababa - Executive Summary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Global Information Infrastructure Commission (GIIC) strongly supports the forward looking thinking of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) in its call for active and on-going private sector participation in the implementation of the African Information Society Initiative (AISI).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the leading intersectoral global private sector organization which seeks to actively involve the developing countries in the process of building the Information Society, the GIIC was pleased to contribute to the formulation, launch, coordination and dissemination of the AISI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To further contribute to the success of the AISI, the GIIC proposes a set of principles that should guide the implementation of the AISI within each African country. This Brief Statement is drawn from a longer Policy Statement.  The GIIC statement focuses on the following four points:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Information Revolution is partially driven by information and communications technologies (ICTs) and is fundamentally important for all societies around the world; The ICT revolution is especially important for developing countries and their people; While a modern imperative for all countries, diffusing ICT effectively and equitably, is neither easy nor automatic; We support and encourage the ECA's commitment to adopt a concrete implementation plan for the AISI as plans for National Information and Communications Infrastructure (NICI) within each African country; We recommend that the implementation of the AISI should take place with as much cooperation as possible between the relevant societal sectors.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - PREAMBLE 1. We, the African Ministers responsible for economic and social development and planning, meeting in Addis Ababa, during the thirty-second session of the Commission/twenty-third meeting of the Conference of Ministers from 5 to 8 May 1997,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">guided by the principles and spirit embodied in the Charters of the United Nations and of the Organization of African Unity, the Abuja Treaty establishing the African Economic Community, the Cairo Plan of Action for Relaunching Africa's Development, the Marrakech Final Act of the Uruguay Round Agreement on Multilateral Trade Negotiations, UNCTAD IX Midrand Declaration &quot;A Partnership for Growth and Development&quot;, and the Comprehensive and Integrated World Trade Organization (WTO) Plan of Action for the Least Developed Countries, endorse the resolutions and declaration adopted by the recently concluded Conference of African Ministers of Finance at its session of 31 March to 2 April 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PURPOSE 2.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have taken stock of Africa's position within the emerging global economic system at the threshold of the twenty-first century. We have deliberated on the appropriate orientation of the development of our countries in the era of a liberalizing and integrating world economy, and the necessary measures that we need to implement in Africa at the level of government, with support from bilateral and multilateral development partners, and in full partnership with African and foreign private enterprise. We reaffirm that African countries assume the primary responsibility for restructuring their economies to the challenges and opportunities of a globalizing and liberalizing world economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRADE INVESTMENT AND DEVELOPMENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. We are convinced that trade and investment are essential components in any credible strategies to accelerate our countries' development and sustain high rates of economic growth. We are also convinced that poverty, which constitutes the most serious problem facing African society today, can be reduced and eventually eradicated by sustained high rates of economic growth that is broad-based and geared to creating employment and generating rising incomes. This objective requires a sustained high rate of investment and production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. We are convinced that this requires considerable resources which can be obtained mainly from an increased rate of domestic savings (by households, private enterprises, and governments), supplemented by official development finance and foreign investment (foreign direct investment, portfolio funds, and finance tapped from international capital markets). We are concerned about the long-term declining trend of official development assistance (ODA) in spite of our economic restructuring efforts and continuing need of development resources. We deplore the marginalization of Africa, at a time when significant positive developments are taking place in our countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In the light of intensifying globalization, we realize that private local and foreign investment is destined to assume increasing importance. We also recognize the central importance of mobilizing domestic financial resources, to boost our domestic savings. Furthermore, our countries have created an environment conducive to expanding trade with the rest of the world. Unfortunately, these efforts have been frustrated by continuing protectionist practices hindering our countries' exports, particularly agricultural products, textiles and clothing, by our trading partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EXTERNAL DEBT BURDEN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The cost of servicing external debt which, for the continent as a whole, is estimated to have exceeded US$ 340 billion at the end of 1996, siphons away considerable resources which could have been productively invested in the development of Africa. We welcome the debt reduction initiative for the highly indebted poor countries (HIPCs Initiative) recently proposed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This is a first step in the right direction. We are hopeful that it will be reinforced by additional more generous bilateral and multilateral measures to substantially reduce all African countries' debt stock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRANSNATIONAL CORPORATIONS AS PARTNERS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. We believe that any fruitful and long-lasting business relationship must be built on the hallowed principles of equity, mutual responsibilities and mutual benefit. It is in this spirit that, in recent years, our countries have adopted new investment codes and instituted many economic reforms.  Foreign partners who believe with us in these principles will make good on their investments and reap the expected dividends. In this regard, we invite transnational corporations to play their rightful role in securing the flow of foreign direct investment while respecting the principles adopted by our countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRADE AND INVESTMENT: OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. We recognize that boosting domestic savings, local and foreign investment, and the productivity of capital together constitute a real challenge. Regarding trade, the entry into force of the Uruguay Round Agreement, mandating significant cuts in tariffs on most tradeable products and limiting countries' recourse to non-tariff measures, offers Africa both opportunities as well as challenges. The thrust of the social, macroeconomic, sectoral, and trade policies that we are implementing in our countries is towards meeting these challenges and grasping the opportunities, so that our countries can realize the full potential of their natural comparative advantages in the world economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PREREQUISITES FOR EXPANDING TRADE AND INVESTMENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. We are aware that in order to achieve our goals (i.e., to boost domestic savings and investment, attract substantial private foreign capital transfers, and expand trade with the rest of the world) our countries must accomplish at least the following prerequisites:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(a) Changing the negative perception of Africa as a high-risk place;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(b) Improving information flow on developments in Africa;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(c) Modernizing, expanding and diversifying production;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(d) Reducing the cost of establishment and doing business;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(e) Strengthening international competitiveness;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(f) Striving for genuine regional economic integration; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(g) Participating more effectively in the multilateral trading system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POSITIVE POLICY TRENDS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. We are convinced that the steps taken by our countries in each of the above areas will contribute to efficiency in our economies. The economic fundamentals are more solid today than they have been in decades. In a number of our countries, fiscal deficits have been reduced, the money supply has been disciplined, inflation is falling, currencies are finding their realistic levels guided by market forces, pressures on the current account have been reduced, economic recovery is under way, and the local private sector is resurgent. To that effect, the reforms undertaken and performances attained will be intensified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AREAS FOR ENHANCED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. We invite domestic and foreign investors to take advantage of the opportunities that have been created by the improved policy and economic environment in our countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. We urge Africa's bilateral partners to continue to provide direct financial support, on concessional terms at increased levels, and to extend indirect support through tax incentives to their national investors participating in infrastructure development projects in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. We trust that multilateral development finance institutions, notably the African Development Bank, the African Export-Import (AFREXIM) Bank and the World Bank, will continue to play an important role, not only in providing substantial financial resources, but also in providing technical assistance to our countries in carrying out analyses of profitability, risk, and environmental factors of projects, especially in infrastructures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE ROLE OF ECA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14. We request the ECA secretariat to identify issues crucial to accelerating trade and investment, and to come up with appropriate strategies, in collaboration with African Governments and leading African and global multilateral institutions, inter alia, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the World Trade Organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We recommend that emphasis be placed especially on practical strategies, and economic and social policy innovations, with particular emphasis on regional cooperation, public-private partnership, and international competitiveness, thereby pointing to new approaches to accelerate Africa's development process. ECA should also function as the clearing house for gathering and disseminating experiences and best practices from within Africa as well as from other regions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Statement from the Kenya Episcopal Conference Catholic Justice and Peace Commission</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a church committed to truth, justice and the service of the Turkana people, we feel that we can no longer remain silent in the face of intimidation, violence, threats and imminent death meted out on Church personnel, Justice and Peace activists, potential politicians and innocent wananchi by the provincial administration and the M.P.s of Turkana North and Central.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we are experiencing at the moment is a reign of tyranny and oppression that surpasses anything that we encountered in the days of one party rule.  Let us clarify by highlighting some of the incidents that have taken place in the last six months that indicate the extent of the coercion that exists in Turkana District</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-In October a Justice and Peace seminar was broken up by the police and the D.O. in Lokitaung, under instructions of the D.C., Mr Reuben Rotich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-The same D.C. in public on Kenyatta Day demanded that the Diocesan Magazine, Sauti ya Jamii, should cease publication.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Church Adult Education teacher's in Loima Location have received written instructions on the orders of the D.C. to cease teaching. Their 'crime', according to the letter issued, was that they were teaching justice and peace.  They were warned if they continued their classes they would be arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-A voluntary catechist faces court charges of incitement for teaching the 1997 National Lenten Campaign in church in Lorengippi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Parishes have received written orders that they cannot hold seminars or meetings without licenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people of Loarengak and Lokitaung have been told by their M.P. to beat any members of the Diocesan Justice and Peace program found in their areas and the same politician at different barazas on March 17th and 22nd called for the expulsion of some missionaries, claiming that the church had a plan to bring chaos and anarchy among the Turkana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven separate incidents of armed robbery on church workers-four resulting in injury have taken place in Lodwar in 1997. All were reported to the police but no affirmative action has taken place. Complaints and reports over corruption in the distribution of famine relief food have been met with abuse and contempt by the administration.&quot; Threats made by the-Turkana North MP against the justice and Peace personnel led Bishop Mahon to write to the D.C.  late last year. Again no acknowledgement of the complaint was received and the threats and intimidation have further increased.' However, the last straw for us was the incident of Tuesday, April 1 st, when two armed men dressed in police uniform attacked and beat two Dutch brothers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their aim this time was not to steal or plunder. Rather they came looking for Bishop Mahon. Fortunately they did not find him and ran away shooting when the alarm was raised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We feel that the aim of that assault was to intimidate if not kill Bishop Mahon, who has been a constant thorn in the flesh of the local M.P.s and the local administration and is a man who is committed to justice and good governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The orchestrated campaign against the church and its people results from its commitment to civic education justice and the Gospel values of tolerance, freedom and the rights of God's people. The harassment and intimidation also comes from desperate politicians aided and abetted by a partisan and oppressive provincial administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If this type of tyranny is reaching such heights in April, we dread to think what it will be like by the time of elections. President Moi promised just this week that security would be guaranteed in this year elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, we reiterate that we have no confidence in those entrusted with the responsibility for security in this district; either to protect church personnel or to bring fairness and impartiality to Turkana in this election year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We wonder is it necessary that people die before appropriate action is taken.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The ANC in KwaZulu Natal is shocked by the assassination of its Richmond Councillor, Mr Rodney van der Byl yesterday night. He was shot about eight times as he was going out of his house to take newspaper deliveries to Kokstad at around 12.15 a.m. in the night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His car was found still running which rules out ordinary crime. Mr Van der Byl is one of the two ANC councillors who refused to be intimidated to resign as an ANC councillor recently. He and Mayor Ragavaloo remained loyal and irrepressible in the face of death.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The ANC's assertion that Richmond has become a virtual concentration camp has been vindicated by this political assassination of Councillor Van der Byl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. That conditions are being created that the new Richmond Council must be determined not by vote but by a gun. The ANC will not allow that situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The police must explain what measures did they take to police the area and protect Mr Van der Byl and the Mayor when they clearly became targets of the Third Force for refusing to resign as ANC Councillors in the recent past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The failure to police the area and to protect these two councillors vindicates the ANC's assertion that while elements of the Third Force are found in the security forces all over the country, in Greater Pietermaritzburg and the surrounding areas the Third Force is indeed in control of the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The ANC calls upon the Minister of Safety and Security, Sydney Mafumadi and National Police Commissioner, George Fivaz, to immediately set up a commission to investigate policing in and around Greater Pietermaritzburg and root out the Third Force in the region at the commanding level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The Mayor of Richmond, Mr Ragavaloo and his family must be provided with 24-hour police security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The ANC calls upon its supporters in Richmond to galvanise themselves and exercise maximum vigilance. The ANC also calls upon the people in the area, especially those who have been promised monies if they kill ANC leaders, to come to the fore and report that to ANC offices.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Written statement by Bill Richardson, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and President Clinton's special envoy to Zaire, issued May 8 in Paris:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten days ago, I went to Africa at the request of President Clinton because of his personal concern for the situation in Zaire and the impact of the war on its people and to Central Africa. This effort was undertaken to support the lead role taken by South Africa and the U.N. and OAU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My first goal was to help bring the parties together. I met with the leaders in Zaire and in the region. Working with the Government of South Africa, under the inspiring leadership of President Nelson Mandela, we were able to secure face-to-face meetings between President Mobutu and Alliance leader Mr. Kabila aboard a South African naval vessel in Pointe-Noire, Congo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We hope that a dialogue for a peaceful resolution to the conflict has been established. We believe that there must be no military solution to the political and economic crisis in Zaire. Our long-standing goal has been a negotiated settlement. This should lead to an inclusive transitional government and fair and free elections. We pressed hard in all our meetings for a soft landing to the crisis, that is a peaceful transition of power avoiding further bloodshed in the country and chaos and violence in the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other reason I went to Zaire was to assess the dire humanitarian situation in eastern Zaire. In Kisangani I saw first-hand the suffering of children -- many of them orphans -- and adults as they struggled to return to their homes in Zaire and Rwanda. I pressed Mr. Kabila to permit full access for international aid organizations and the United Nations and condemned the abuses, deaths and murders of innocent civilians. Mr. Kabila assured me that international aid organizations and the U.N. would have adequate time to repatriate the refugees, that they would be given full access to the refugees and that those Alliance soldiers found guilty of abuses would be punished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was encouraged by meetings with Mr. Kabila as we discussed both the political crisis and the situation of refugees and displaced person and the future course Zaire must take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I came to France -- our oldest ally -- because of her historic and important role in Africa to discuss where we should go in dealing with the crisis. We are both working to get the two sides in Zaire to cooperate in the talks mediated by the Government of South Africa and the U.N. and OAU and to agree on an end to the fighting and the establishment of an inclusive transitional arrangement that would lead to democratic elections and creation of a free market economy in short order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States will continue to be involved because of the long-standing friendship between the people of the United States and the people of Africa.  We share their desire for establishing a democratic Zaire that promotes tolerance, economic development and stability in the country and the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would like to reemphasize what I told Mr. Kabila in Lubumbashi. An Alliance military victory is within reach. But the political future of Zaire is at risk. The citizens of Zaire, the international community and history will judge the Alliance on the decisions and actions taken in the coming days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is critical to avoid further bloodshed, especially in Kinshasa, and to work with South Africa and the United Nations and OAU Envoy Sahnoun for a negotiated, inclusive transitional arrangement, leading to democratic elections. It is important to cooperate with humanitarian agencies to deal with the critical situation in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have urged Mobutu to delegate authority to negotiators to work with the South Africans for a peaceful transfer of authority.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - The number of black students at the Lowveld Agricultural College had increased from two in 1995 to 72 this year, said Mpumalanga MEC for agriculture, January Masilela on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said 40 students received their higher certificates last year, including the college's first black student.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Masilela warned, however, that the budget allocation for human resource development in his department had been cut by eight percent to R10,21 million this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Agricultural training is, unfortunately, expensive,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To train and retrain people and equip them with the best knowledge and skills, we need to develop and expand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If this is not possible, it will eventually lead to stagnation and lower standards and quality of training,&quot; Masilela warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the current budget would only allow non-formal training facilities at Mzinti and Funda Mlimi to be maintained this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, 124 non-formal short courses were held across the province, reaching more than 8 600 trainees, he said. .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Farmers who failed to maintain their infrastructure and take risk reduction measures would not receive disaster aid in future, warned Mpumalanga MEC for Agriculture, January Masilela, on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his department had spent R27,1 million on aid to farmers who suffered flood damage during the February floods in the province last year, although it had only been granted R18,1 million by central government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was alarming to note that most of the claims were received from applicants who did not maintain their conservation structures or build their dams to specification,&quot; said Masilela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said 652 applications for assistance had been received by his department to repair cultivated land, water works, soil conservation works and other infrastructure damaged by flood waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In future, disaster aid will only be considered in exceptional cases and farmers will be expected to reduce their vulnerability by practising sound and environmentally friendly farming practices,&quot; Masilela said. .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - The Mpumalanga department of agriculture's budget for the 1996/97 year had decreased by 4,1 percent to R92,664 million, said MEC for Agriculture, January Masilela on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presenting his annual report and budget speech, Masilela said R25,015 million of the budget would be spent on agricultural extension, and R15, 761 million on veterinary services.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mpumalanga, as far as its veterinary regulatory function is concerned, is the most important province in South Africa,&quot; Masilela explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Mpumalanga played a pivotal role in safeguarding the rest of the country by controlling foot-and-mouth disease and African swine fever which are endemic to the Lowveld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said agricultural extension services operated from 60 offices across the province where staff dealt with drought or flood relief, land potential assessments, and with beneficiaries of the government's land reform project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No wonder 26 percent of our budget is spent here,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Masilela said R12, 761 million will be spent on agricultural engineering services such as the provision of engineering technology, while R10, 210 million will be spent on agricultural training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A further R9,115 million will be spent on technology development, R7, 375 million on administrative support and R5,108 million on soil conservation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said spending 5,5 percent of the budget on soil conservation was, however, &quot;not good enough&quot; to sustain agricultural production. .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - A large government delegation, led by safety &amp; security minister Sydney Mufamadi, held secret negotiations with the Bushbuckridge Border Crisis Committee in Nelspruit on Wednesday in an attempt to defuse growing militancy in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The negotiations at Arbor Park, aimed at getting the Crisis Committee to call off their campaign to have the area ceded from Northern Province to Mpumalanga, were however inconclusive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately after the meeting, another government office complex and timber yard was burnt by pro-Mpumalanga protesters at Greenvale and a third freight truck was torched by demonstrators on Thursday morning.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defiance campaign, which is about to enter its second week, was sparked off by the alleged failure of Constitutional Affairs minister Valli Moosa to address a rally on the issue on Worker's Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police attempts to disperse almost 15 000 demonstrators after the rally led to a series of widespread protests including barricades on majors roads to the Kruger National Park, the torching of a police patrol van, a Home Affairs office complex, two large freight trucks and two government vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of shops in the area have also been looted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa refused to say why the meeting was secret or what it had achieved, insisting that &quot;the ball is now in the Committee's court. It's up to them&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crisis Committee secretary, Sizile Ndlovu, also refused to comment, insisting that it had been agreed that all statements would be made through Mamoepa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African Eye News Service (South Africa) has, however, been able to confirm that the national ANC delegation headed by Minister Mufamadi also included environmental affairs deputy minister, Peter Mokaba, Communist Party secretary-general Charles Nqhakula and ANC executive committee member Nosiziwe Nghakule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpumalanga's delegation was led by premier Mathews Phosa and included seven of his MECs, plus Mpumalanga's legislative chief whip Jackson Mthembu and the House's deputy speaker, Cynthia Maropeng.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Northern Province delegation was headed by provincial ANC chairman George Mashamba and seven other senior provincial working committee members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources reveal that Northern Province premier Ngoako Ramatlhodi was not present at the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, more than 6 000 protesters marched on the Mkhulu Police Station near Hazyview on Thursday afternoon, where a memorandum was handed to the station commander, Sam Shabangu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shabangu, who declined to give his rank, refused to release a copy of the memorandum to the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No incidents of violence or arrests were reported during the march.  Bushbuckridge residents are also scheduled to meet at a rally at Paulianah Stadium in the town's CBD on Friday, possibly to discuss the Nelspruit negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police spokesman Captain Thomas Ramatseba told African Eye News Service (South Africa) on Thursday night that police had managed to dismantle all remaining barricades on the region's roads and that the area was now &quot;safe to travel through&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Ten percent of staff at the Mpumalanga department of agriculture accepted severance packages last year, resulting in vacancies in key areas which urgently needed to be filled, said MEC for agriculture, January Masilela, on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presenting his annual report for 1996/1997, Masilela said if the vacancies were not filled, there may be a breakdown in services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Key posts in management and communication have been filled, but the filling of vacancies in agricultural economics and soil conservation remains a problem,&quot; Masilela said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said a more serious problem, however, was acquiring funds to fill the 400 approved vacant posts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To fill the 400 vacant posts...will cost more than R18 million - more than our total budget for 1997/98,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Masilela said financial management had also been a major problem during the past year after a shortage of skilled staff led to the misallocation of expenditure and the incapacity to spend the allocated funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A few cases of misappropriation of funds have been dealt with decisively,&quot; he added, stressing that the incidents were an &quot;inherited&quot; problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the setbacks, Masilela said his province had also delivered a significant amount of services to the province during the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said services regarding mechanisation, soil conservation and irrigation engineering had been rendered to the farming community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said rural communities had also been given dipping facilities, dams, small scale irrigation systems and roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rural farmers were also informed as to methods of watering stock and the necessary precautions to take regarding human consumption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small scale farmers were also trained with regards to debushing, and the installation and maintenance of community gardens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is delivery,&quot; Masilela said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it was important that farmers understood the importance of soil conservation, but said only 5,5 percent of the budget would be allocated to this division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is just not good enough if we want to sustain agricultural production in this province,&quot; Masilela said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit -The Moldenhauer Commission into Fraudulent Licenses had to postpone its scheduled hearings in Nelspruit on Thursday after none of the witnesses turned up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All three scheduled witnesses, did however send last minute excuses to Commission chairman, chief magistrate Heinrich Moldenhauer, asking to be allowed to testify about their involvement in the control of licenses next week Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpumalanga traffic director Henry Brazer, who was scheduled as the day's lead witness was again unable to appear because of an unspecified stress related ailment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazer also failed to appear before the Commission on Wednesday after he booked himself into the Nelspruit Private Hospital under a pseudonym just hours before his scheduled testimony at 14h00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hospital general manager Sarel van der Walt told African Eye News Service (South Africa) that Brazer had left strict instructions that no information about his medical condition, the name of his doctor or expected date of discharge should be released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conceding that it was unusual for patients to book in under pseudonym, Van der Walt said that Brazer believed this &quot;anonymity&quot; was the only way he would get the rest he needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hospital staff confirmed that tight control was being kept on Brazer's room and added that his condition was definitely related to heart and thrombosis problems which were aggravated by stress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazer's legal representative declined to comment, saying that he did not have time to speak with the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazer is the third senior official to be booked off work on sick leave just before their scheduled testimony at the Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provincial safety &amp; security MEC Steve Mabona has been booked off work since Monday and, according to his office, will only be able to testify before the Commission next week Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is reportedly recovering from the unspecified stress related illness at home after being discharged from a Johannesburg clinic on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the second time that Mabona has been booked off sick for stress since investigations into the irregular issuing of a drivers and learners license to Parliamentary deputy speaker Baleka Mbete-Kgositsile began three week ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite having no constituency or other links with Mpumalanga, Mabona arranged for her to be specially tested for the two licenses in Delmas on October 1 last year. He has admitted to sending his state issue car and personal bodyguards to Johannesburg to fetch Mbete-Kgositsile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazer, who was also reportedly booked off work at the time after a minor heart-attack, drove 350km from Nelspruit to Delmas to personally test Mbete- Kgositsile &quot;as a sign of respect&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is not however registered as a certified testing officer and also made errors while filling in the application forms - which were also from the incorrect area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third senior official who booked himself off work this week is departmental head, Advocate Stanley Soko, who has been accused by traffic officers of halting an internal investigation into the allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Soko's office, he was admitted to the Pretoria East Hospital with stress related &quot;back-ache&quot;. He is currently recovering at home in Pretoria and will be ready to testify next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two other witnesses who failed to appear before the Commission on Thursday are unidentified residents of KwaNdebele thought to be connected to driving schools. They contacted the Commission after reading about the investigation in the Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These two people told me that they were still compiling vital documentation for the Commission and could not testify before everything was ready,&quot; confirmed Commission chairman, chief magistrate Heinrich Moldenhauer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission will reconvene on Monday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Although 15 million copies of the matric examination paper were printed in Mpumalanga last year, not one paper was leaked, said Mpumalanga MEC for Education, David Mabuza, on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not only did we succeed in managing this process, but we were able to improve our overall matric pass rate by 6,3 percent,&quot; Mabuza told the provincial legislature during his budget speech.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that this year, his department had made a special commitment to take the physically disabled into consideration when building schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although this will have serious financial implications, it is our hope that this legislature will support us in carrying these costs,&quot; Mabuza said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These people live with us in our communities and therefore there is no rationale why they are conspicuously absent in our schools, offices and even in this legislature,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabuza said the previous government had also neglected development of black children until the age of nine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said four colleges in the province had thus started providing Early Childhood Development training for teachers from Grade 0 to Grade 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Experts argue that the development of a child, especially their thinking capacity, is critical between the ages of 0 and nine,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabuza also said that the issue of subsidising independent schools was still under discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nevertheless, I need to state upfront that the previous funding levels which were higher than those applied in public schools will definitely have to change,&quot; he said. .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - The remnants of &quot;crude&quot; apartheid language and other &quot;obnoxious&quot; representations of content in past school curricula have been removed, said Mpumalanga MEC for Education, David Mabuza on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presenting his budget speech to the Mpumalanga legislature, Mabuza said words such as &quot;homelands&quot; had been removed from all school curricula in the province.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his department would introduce a new curriculum for Grade 1 and Grade 7 (Standard Five) at the beginning of next year as part of the national Curriculum 2005 programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the new curriculum would emphasise thinking and reasoning skills, as determined by the National Qualifications Framework.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This will be followed by the introduction of a new curriculum in other grades, up to the year 2005,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabuza said the new curriculum would also emphasise career guidance at schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot afford to have students choosing areas of learning that only guarantees them a place in the unemployment basket,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said teachers would also be given additional training in Science and Economics so they were able to teach pupils marketable skills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At primary level, our Mpumalanga Primary School Initiative pilot project with the aid of the British Government Overseas Development Agency, which focuses on mathematics, science, technology and communication, is already underway,&quot; Mabuza said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said a mobile career guidance unit was also in operation and that several schools in the province had already received computers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabuza warned that only 40 percent of residents in Mpumalanga were literate, which would impact on the economic growth rate of the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The province's Adult Basic Education Training project aimed at increasing literacy levels, he said. .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - Despite the expectation that Sunday's long-awaited direct meeting between President Mobutu and Mr. Kabila would be a move towards easing the plight of the many victims of Zaire's six-month old conflict, the situation is becoming more dramatic by the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegates from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) based in Kinshasa, Kisangani, Goma, Bukavu, Uvira and Lubumbashi, are working with other humanitarian organizations to help alleviate the suffering of the local Zairian population and Rwandan refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kisangani Airbridge In Closing Stage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 3,700 displaced people had been repatriated from Kisangani to Goma and Bukavu, as of Friday, May 2. ICRC planes flew 31 rotations and UN organizations another six.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under a second repatriation operation started in Kindu, 440 of an estimated 1,200 internally displaced people had been flown back to Bukavu by Friday, May 2. The operation is being organized by a team of ICRC expatriates temporarily based in Kindu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kalemie, five expatriates are currently assessing the number of internally displaced present in the area and trying to arrange transport for those trying to leave. To gain access to displaced persons outside Kalemie, two landcruisers had to be shipped to the town. Some 120 unaccompanied children have already been identified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Uvira, the stream of refugees and internally displaced returning from Kalemie, Fizi and Kigoma has slowed considerably. Food assistance to the returnees continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Support Services for Repatriation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kisangani, some 45 Zairian Red Cross volunteers and two ICRC nurses offered medical assistance to families waiting at the site there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To restore family links disrupted by the conflict and to provide an additional incentive for internally displaced to return home, several thousand Red Cross messages have been sent to and from Kisangani and Kivu over the past four weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Bukavu, delegates have set up a tracing team at the airport itself: disembarking families are asked whether any family members are missing and, if so, they are referred to a center for unaccompanied children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past few weeks, the Red Cross message network in Kivu has been using the services of local radio stations and churches, which has helped the Red Cross respond rapidly to the increased demand for tracing services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as relief assistance is concerned, internally displaced have been assisted with food on disembarking. Resettlement kits will be distributed once beneficiaries have been registered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Support for Rwandan Refugees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICRC remains highly preoccupied by the desperate plight of the Rwandan refugees in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kisangani, 185 Zairian Red Cross volunteers are fully supported and coordinated by the ICRC to carry out food and non-food distributions to Rwandan refugees. They are working in close coordination with other humanitarian organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following reports that some 7,000 Rwandan refugees are traveling westward, from the area around Mbandaka, down the Zaire river, the delegation in Kinshasa has organized reconnaissance flights to locate the refugee groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preparations in Kinshasa &amp; Brazzaville</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In cooperation with the Zairian Red Cross, priority has been given to emergency preparedness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout the 24 districts of Kinshasa, Zairian Red Cross first aid teams will be on standby, prepared to help the wounded and the sick and to evacuate the most seriously injured to one of eight reference hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In total, some 2,700 Red Cross volunteers, most of them specially trained, are ready to respond to medical emergencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medical delegates have evaluated the health structures in Kinshasa and an inventory was drawn up to provide them with the right medical material, should the need arise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief distributions in Kinshasa will be carried out by Zairian Red Cross volunteers, with technical and material support from the ICRC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of today (May 7), the Zairian Red Cross will start distributing food and non-food relief to some 16,000 people; among them internally displaced persons recently arrived in Kinshasa, as well as to hospitals, prisons, orphanages and other institutions throughout the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To minimize the risk of a cholera epidemic, increasingly likely as the influx of internally displaced further raises population density in the city, ICRC supported clean-up and hygiene campaigns have been stepped up in markets and other public places. Water treatment facilities of the state water company have been assessed and measures taken to provide assistance if necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICRC in Brazzaville has been reinforced with personnel and logistics and has prepared emergency stocks of food and non-food assistance, enough for 5,000 families for one month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ongoing activities in Kivu and Shaba</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kivu, medical and tracing activities continue, although they have recently been hampered by increasing insecurity around Goma and Bukavu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Water and sanitation delegates, who have so far concentrated mainly on water treatment plants in the main centers (Goma, Bukavu, Uvira, Kisangani), will now shift their attention to smaller towns, particularly in the north (Bunia, Isiro).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - The Freedom of Expression Institute (FXI) and the Mail and Guardian (M&amp;G) newspaper (M&amp;G) have appealed to the Cape Town High Court to make public the proceedings of a court marshal involving two soldiers charged with leaking &quot;sensitive information&quot; and accusing their superior of racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G reports that the two soldiers, staff sergeant Herman Phieffer and corporal Desmod Booysen, were court marshaled for accusing their commanding officer Colonel Pat McLoughlin of racism during investigations by a military intelligence officer into allegations of arms smuggling in the Western Cape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coordinator of the FXI's Defence Fund, Alec Kuhn, told MISA May 8, the case would involve among others, challenging the constitutionality of the South African Defence Forces Act and the Protection of Information Act, the provision of which were invoked by the court marshal to have the hearings in camera. The two organisations argue hearing of the case in camera would deny the accused a fair trial. &quot;This is the first known case of challenging the Defence Forces Act and the Protection of Information Act with regards to court marshals,&quot; she told MISA.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An application on April 7 by FXI and M&amp;G to have the proceedings heard in public was denied by the court marshal on the grounds that the two had no &quot; locus standi&quot; or right to make such an application before it. Kuhn said the whole case bordered on the right to free expression by the soldiers, including the right of the public to have access to court marshal proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the lawyer representing FXI and M&amp;G, Karin Norval, told MISA the two organisations want the hearings to be made public because this was a constitutional right of the accused persons; besides, the case had generated a lot of public interest. &quot;We want public hearings because we believe the accused are entitled to that,&quot; she said. The application is likely to be heard in June, meanwhile, the proceedings of the court marshal have been suspended pending the outcome of the appeal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - The Swaziland Media and Printing Allied Workers Union (SMEPAWU) claims that Swazi Television (STV) failed to cover Labour Day celebrations in Mhlambanyatsi area due to &quot;possible political interference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SMEPAWU president Lwazi Hlophe told MISA May 7, it was strange that STV failed to cover the event when there had been earlier indications that it would be covered. &quot;I spoke to the news editor on the eve of Labour Day and he assured me that he would personally cover the May 1 celebrations after finishing a recording with the minister of information, Muntu Mswane,&quot; Hlope told MISA adding: &quot;I don't know what happened later, whether the minister told the editor not to go, or the editor decided this on his own.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STV management has, however, denied this. STV acting manager Mike Cornwell told MISA the failure to cover the event was due to the Labour Day holiday itself. &quot;Neither daily newspaper was published on May 1 and do not publish on any public holiday... whereas STV journalists generally fill the news gap left by the print media. Workers Day seemed an appropriate public holiday to allow them (time off). At STV we do not have a large news department and the few who man it work long shifts and enjoy few privileges,&quot; Cornwell explained.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cornwell further denied May 4 press reports quoting him as blaming some journalists for the failure to cover the event. &quot;I was misquoted when the Times of Swaziland said I did not know where our journalists were. I knew they were at the Labour Day celebrations and were attending as workers as is their right to do so,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in February this year, Swaziland cabinet ordered a blanket ban of the state-controlled radio and television broadcasters from covering the country-wide strike. The ban had reportedly been effected under Section 12 of the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Act, 1997, which bans all materials likely to &quot;incite the public against the government&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While workers at the television station told MISA that on January 22 and February 5, live talk show programmes related to the labour strike were prevented from being broadcast on the Swazi Television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, on April 21 the Swaziland government announced it was in the process of designing an editorial policy for all government-controlled media.  However, the media said that government's statement was coming barely after reports that authorities criticised Swazi Television for its full coverage of opposition Swaziland Democratic Alliance (SDA) demonstrations. The SDA went on a demonstration on April 12 against the 1973 Proclamation banning free political activity. April 12 marked 24 years of the King Sobhuza 1973 Decree which effectively nullified the 1968 Constitution as well as free political activity and the right to free expression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BACKGROUND</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swaziland is a southern African Kingdom which has to date resisted political reforms and has been widely reluctant to introduce a written constitution. The royal proclamation in April, 1973 by King Sobhuza II annulled the 1968 Constitution. The Decree effectively outlawed party politics and annulled the Bill of Rights contained in the 1968 Constitution which included the right to free expression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traditionally, the King rules by the King Sobhuza 1973 Decree which does not provide for freedom of the press and the right to free speech. On July 26 last year, however, King Mswati III appointed the first ever Constitutional Draft Committee following calls from media workers, opposition parties, human rights organisations and labour unions for a written constitution to be re- introduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Progress towards drafting the constitution, however, has been retarded by a lack of political will on the part of Swaziland authorities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The National Party in the Western Cape is not yet planning to go it alone, although a split is one of its options, says Hernus Kriel, the NP provincial leader and premier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking as cracks in the party widened between his hardline faction and NP verligtes under Gauteng party leader Roelf Meyer, Mr Kriel told the Cape Town Press Club yesterday he did not believe the province should leave mainstream South African politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if things go very wrong in the NP, it will have to split,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on the disbanding of the NP task force, led by Mr Meyer, to investigate the formation of a new political movement, he said Mr Meyer had acted outside the mandate NP leader F W de Klerk had given him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rejecting accusations that he was &quot;verkramp&quot;, Mr Kriel - who described himself as &quot;a full-blown liberal&quot; - said the Western Cape NP fully supported the sacking of Mr Meyer and his task team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he and Mr Meyer shared the same goals to realign political parties, but their methods differed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believed a wide-ranging political reorientation was necessary across the country, involving not just the NP but the Democrats, Freedom Front &quot;and &quot;the ANC-SA Communist Party-Cosatu alliance&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People who shared ideas and value systems would have to be brought together, he said. Meanwhile Mpumalanga NP leader David Malatsi, the first black provincial head of the party, who was part of Mr Meyer's task team, said yesterday he accepted Mr De Klerk's decision to scrap it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But retired minister Pik Botha told a Cape Argus correspondent in Pretoria the NP had no future and should disband if it wanted to have any hope of opposing the African National Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Meyer will seek guidance on his own political options from his Gauteng head council on May 17, as the party's future for the moment lies in the hands of his Gauteng allies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One is to lead like-minded Nats out of the party into a quest for a new home; the other is to challenge Mr De Klerk for the leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the second option would be sure to result in a bruising battle ending in defections from either the old guard or Mr Meyer's supporters, depending on the outcome of a leadership contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the first option, should Mr Meyer quit as an MP, with other Nationalists following him out of the party, would mean exile from mainstream parliamentary politics because of the bar on MPs keeping their seats if they change party allegiance. Mr Meyer will spend the days ahead in consultations with colleagues in Gauteng.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Tourism authorities in Cape Town and Durban have been at daggers drawn over comments by a Satour official on the respective merits of the cities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We hope that readers have enjoyed reading as much as we have enjoyed reporting in the Cape Argus the recent to-do regarding the relative merits of Durban and Cape Town as venues for an international tourism indaba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's been welcome respite from the more serious and dour social issues which fill our lives to be able to give voice to our beloved city's attractions. It's also nice to be on the side that's winning palpably.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exchanges were sparked by a comment - with which citizens of the Peninsula could only agree enthusiastically - by Satour acting chief executive Reg Swart. He suggested delegates to the tourism conference being run in Durban would have preferred, given the choice, to be in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This did not go down too well on the Indian Ocean side. Reported a Durban newspaper: the city's &quot;marketing bosses are seething&quot;. A stung Peter Bendheim, Durban metro communications officer, offered this opinion: &quot;It (Durban) is South Africa's only truly African city. In Cape Town, delegates might as well be in Europe, with a pretty mountain in the background.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well. We Africans who live in the shadow of that pretty mountain are getting fairly tired of this oft-repeated &quot;Cape Town is out of Africa&quot; argument which one hears constantly from people who do not have the good fortune to live in this part of the continent. Africa is made up of countries and cities of unimaginable variety. None is more or less quintessentially African than another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we understand the Durban sulk, and promise faithfully to get to work on our conference facilities - if only to ensure that future tourism delegates from Durban can fully enjoy a spell under the spell of the &quot;pretty mountain&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - &quot;Dear Ms McGrath, congratulations on your selection by the National Foundation for Women Business Owners (NFWBO) as one of the 'Women to Watch'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chatting over scones and cream on a dreamy autumn day in the exquisite gardens of the Cellars-Hohenort hotel, this hotelier extraordinary with the Midas touch recalls her surprise on reading a letter from France that began thus in March this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It hit me quite between the eyes as I wasn't expecting it. At first I thought it must be a hoax as I couldn't believe anyone would be interested in us,&quot; Liz said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NFWBO is a non-profit research and leadership development foundation whose mission is to strengthen women who own businesses and their enterprises throughout the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first time, the foundation has identified 50 leading women entrepreneurs of the world and 10 upwardly mobile &quot;Women to Watch&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staying at two of Paris's greatest hotels, the De Ville and the Hotel de Crillon, the women were hosted by the mayor of Paris and feted as special guests. They also visited the fashion houses of Hermes, Lanvin and Christian Dior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 50 Leading Women Entrepreneurs of the World that were identified represent 23 countries and collectively $139-billion in annual sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 10 Women to Watch represent nine countries - Brazil, Canada, Greece, Japan, Malaysia, Poland, Scotland, South Africa and Britain - and collectively generate more than $209-million in annual sales, while employing more than 8 000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The first thing we did when we got to Paris was to say 'How did you find us?' &quot; says Liz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Of course we did have to give our turnovers, which was rather frightening because when mine was translated into dollars it was peanuts compared with some of the others. I was a junior, junior and I was very honoured. It was like being in fairyland and, of course, I felt proud to be a South African and to represent my country. I have always been an addicted builder, decorator and gardener. Owning a hotel feeds my addictions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has also fed her company's profits, which have grown from R5-million in 1992 to R17,8-million last year and has seen its employees double to 345.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When her husband died in 1985, Liz felt the only way to find meaning in her life was to devote herself to what, until then, had been one of her passionate hobbies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She bought the virtually derelict but superbly situated one-star Plettenberg Hotel (formerly the Lookout overlooking the famous beach) and within no time at all had transformed it into a five-star establishment where the world's rich and famous could enjoy one of the most glorious views in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next Liz purchased the Cellars Country House, a nine-room guesthouse in the forests of Constantia, and likewise turned it into one of Cape Town's most exclusive country house hotels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not a feminist but I'm starting to get a bit that way, because every one of these women had the same experience as I did - the banks and people they had to work with didn't believe they could do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had deputations coming to me to tell me to stop it and to settle back and enjoy my life. I started the Plettenberg at a time when we were in the middle of apartheid, when we didn't have all that tourism, but I had a vision of turning a dump that my husband and I bought into something worthwhile,&quot; said Liz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having visited more than 50 Relais &amp; Chateaux hotels while travelling with her husband, she had a good idea of what was being done overseas and knew how to adapt it to South African conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although English by birth and in manner, Liz is passionately pro-South African.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We live in paradise. I was born in England, and only came to South Africa on holiday. When I met my husband-to-be, I decided to stay. That's when I became a South African and a passionate one. From the minute I arrived I loved it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liz's husband was himself an immensely successful businessman - he was Gallo Africa chairman and director of the Premier Group. But she took no part in the business. What Liz has learnt she has learnt without any training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I started I couldn't read a balance sheet and I couldn't do a budget.  I just learnt because I had to and I was determined to because I wasn't going to let anyone else do it for me. I pinch myself sometimes and think how crazy because I wasn't trained.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liz says she always believed that South African tourism would take off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you've got a country like this people must come and see it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who have been some of the more interesting guests?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Queen Elizabeth's entourage stayed at the Cellars-Hohenort during her visit, her ladies in waiting and even the footmen from Buckingham Palace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The King and Queen of Sweden stayed incognito and Zaire's Mobutu Sese Seko was a guest too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of Liz's favourites was Sir Alfred Beit, after whose ancestors Beit Bridge, which links South Africa and Zimbabwe across the Limpopo River, was named.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He asked whether he could stay for three weeks and I thought 'Oh no, he's going to be too difficult' and tried to dissuade him, and three months later when he and his wife left we were all standing here with tears running down our cheeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Magnus Malan may have laid himself open to civil claims for damages from victims of SA Defence Force cross-border raids and internal operations in which innocent civilians died, Truth Commission deputy chairman Alex Boraine warned today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called on General Malan to apply for amnesty &quot;even at this 11th hour&quot; - the deadline for amnesty applications is midnight tomorrow - for the sake of reconciliation in the country and in his own interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Boraine's remarks follow a statement by General Malan after his voluntary testimony to the Truth Commission in Cape Town this week, saying he stood by his decision not to apply for amnesty.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Boraine told the Cape Argus today there were two reasons why he believed General Malan should apply for amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first was because the former defence minister had told the commission he had agreed to testify in order to further the cause of reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He played a dominant role as head of the SADF and as minister in the implementation of a policy that damaged and destroyed many people, both in South Africa and in the surrounding countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Malan had also publicly acknowledged he had given orders for raids and had accepted responsibility for the killing of innocent civilians by soldiers under his command.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Violations of fundamental human rights were committed by the SADF and in the final analysis he was responsible they were his orders,&quot; Dr Boraine said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In my opinion he puts himself at risk of possible civil claims from victims and their relatives of military manoeuvres, both inside the country and out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So he should seek amnesty both in terms of his own commitment to reconciliation, and in his own self-interest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">n Former state president P W Botha has not yet replied to a comprehensive set of questions by the commission, but his attorney told Dr Boraine this week he and Mr Botha were working &quot;flat out&quot; on the submission, which was a &quot; huge undertaking&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Banks, attorneys, stockbrokers and others could soon have to report all transactions over R50 000 or R100 000 to a new Financial Intelligence Centre, in terms of moves by the authorities to curb money laundering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Measures under consideration to tackle the spreading evil of money laundering include the creation of a unit with powers to investigate a range of people and institutions including banks, attorneys, insurance brokers, estate agents, coin and bullion dealers and accountants, according to Reserve Bank official Charles van Staden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech to the International Forensic Conference in the Waterfront yesterday, Mr Van Staden said a draft Money Laundering Control Bill, as revised by the Law Commission, was being considered by the Department of Finance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill suggested the creation of a Financial Intelligence Centre, which could be housed in the Department of Finance, the Reserve Bank, or be a separate entity, with powers similar to those of the Office for Serious Economic Offences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banks, attorneys, brokers, traders, estate agents, stockbrokers, casino managers, coin and Krugerrand dealers, accountants, stokvel directors and other &quot;accountable institutions&quot; would be obliged to report to the centre details of any transaction involving cash above a set limit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Van Staden said the threshold had not yet been set but &quot;one can safely assume that it would be between R50 000 and R100 000&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the United States, cash transactions from $10 000 had to be reported, he said, and the US equivalent of the proposed Financial Intelligence Centre processed 11,5 million deals a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a threshold-based reporting system is automatic, it leaves less scope for corruption and errors of judgment,&quot; Mr Van Staden said. Transactions which might appear innocent when seen in isolation could be shown to warrant investigation when seen as part of the broader picture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Institutions would also have to report all international electronic fund transfers and cross border cash transfers, as well as all &quot;suspicious transactions&quot;, within a maximum of 10 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The obligation to report would override any duty of secrecy to the customer or client, and anyone making such a report would be protected by law from any breach of confidentiality, Mr Van Staden said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Financial Intelligence Centre would not only collect and analyse information and pass it on to the relevant investigating authority, but could also conduct its own investigations into money laundering. The director of the centre would be able to demand access to records and could order an institution to suspend a deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Van Staden quoted international figures suggesting that in 1990 nearly US $233 million in drug money was available daily for laundering around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Africa alone there were more than 278 international crime syndicates operating and the country was increasingly seen as a convenient place to market and transit drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far banks had been the main agents for &quot;washing&quot; and recycling illegally acquired wealth, but non-banking institutions were likely to be used more and more, he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Child maintenance grants from the State are the first line of defence against poverty and malnutrition for many people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Africa an estimated 14,3-million children under the age of 15 live in poverty, of whom only 349 692 get maintenance grants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative barriers and lack of information have severely restricted access to the grants and the system clearly needs to be changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welfare Minister Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi says the new benefit system is premised on the need to de-racialise government policies. &quot;We have a moral and constitutional obligation to extend benefits to those people who have not had access to public assistance in the past.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone agrees with that, but not with the proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new system recommends that the primary caregiver gets a flat rate benefit of R75 a month per child under six. This payment will be subject to a means test (still to be determined). Ms Fraser-Moleketi has said she hopes to reach three million of the 5,1-million children under six by 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The present maintenance system gives a parent allowance of R430 (which falls away under the new system) and a child allowance of R135 for up to two children under 18 years old. These grants will be phased out over five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed new system, based on recommendations by the Lund Committee on child and family support, has met with opposition from the Non-Governmental Organisations Coalition, Cosatu, church groups, human rights groups and the Gender Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say the grant is too little and too limited and will have disastrous consequences for the most vulnerable members of society: children living in poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They claim there has been inadequate consultation on the new system, saying the Lund Committee did not call for representations from civil society before the report was published in August 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cabinet accepted the recommendations in March this year before the portfolio committee on welfare had the chance to discuss or hold public hearings on the recommendations. In April, when the portfolio committee did hear from civil society, warnings were sounded that the recommendations could seriously damage the welfare of children in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Fraser-Moleketi responded last week by saying there was no turning back.  &quot;The new child support benefit will become a reality,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While government argues that it cannot afford to spend more than the R2- billion it will cost to implement payouts for children, critics argue that it cannot afford not to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conrad Barberton of Idasa's poverty monitoring service said debate on the proposals had tended to focus almost entirely on what the new system was likely to cost the fiscus in terms of actual expenditure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What it hasn't done is to look in depth at negative consequences of the proposal,&quot; he said. &quot;Fiscal constraint is used to defend choices, but we need to look at other kinds of costs and consequences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of these is the high infant mortality rates in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A decent system of social security will not be able to solve this but it could go some way to averting its worst consequences,&quot; Mr Barberton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UWC's Community Rehabilitation Project has said it is unrealistic for a child to survive on R75 a month, a sentiment echoed by many organisations.  The household subsistence level for a low-income household in Cape Town is R96,83 a month, excluding rent and transport (calculated by University of Port Elizabeth Institute for Development Planning).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new system will have a disastrous effect on women and children from impoverished communities, the New Women's Movement has said. &quot;The minister has failed to reprioritise women and children's needs by reviewing the budget.  She is determined to go ahead with the Cabinet decisions despite fierce opposition from women who live in dire poverty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Women on Farms project warned that while self-reliance should be encouraged, many mothers would not be able to provide for their children on R75 a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long-term impacts on children included malnutrition, which impaired a child's mental development and caused stunting. This in turn increased the burden on the health system and mental institutions, reduced the effectiveness of education spending, and reduced the future productivity of the labour force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other negative impacts were an increase in child abuse due to poor economic conditions at home, which increased the burden on policing and the judicial system and increased social welfare costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kumi Naidoo, executive director of the NGO Coalition, said that until there was an effective cross-departmental strategy to combat poverty, the new proposals would exacerbate problems of child labour, prostitution and crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is it not more cost-effective to invest government resources in social security for children than to spend resources on dealing with the consequences of child poverty?&quot; said Mr Barberton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision on the child benefit system has been based on fiscal constraints - what the country can afford - and the minister has taken a conservative approach, one she says is fiscally sustainable in both medium and long term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But critics say child maintenance grants should be based not only on what the Government says it can afford, but on what children need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Barberton said the Government had allocated little more than a &quot;couple of crumbs&quot; of the budget cake to address child poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the department was serious about asking for an adequate slice of the budget cake it would have taken these costs into consideration, and worked out the costs of not implementing an adequate system. It has not done that,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is assumed that the Government cannot afford to spend more than R2- billion on social security for children. No one - the Lund committee, the minister of welfare or the department - has explained why financial constraints on social security for children should be R2-billion and not more.  Are these real or self-imposed?&quot; said Mr Barberton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1997/98 Budget only 0,6 percent of the Budget was allocated to social security for children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A third of the Budget, at least R66-billion, was &quot;top-sliced&quot; for priority spending on interest on government debt, improvements in civil servants' service conditions, carry-through costs for social pensions, RDP projects and commitment to the housing programme, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Budget Council, which consists almost entirely of men, did not regard providing social security for children to be sufficiently crucial to include in the priority category of expenditures,&quot; said Mr Barberton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics ask whether the new child maintenance system is being used to limit government spending on social security for children. Studies have shown that because of a lack of administrative capacity, the proposals will lead to a huge reduction in overall spending on child and family support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Administrative barriers and lack of information continue to be a problem in allocating grants, with rural areas worse off than urban areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Lund report did not address problems of administration in any detail,&quot; said Mr Barberton, &quot;and this is the greatest constraint on access to the present system of state maintenance grants or any new system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unless it's improved drastically and equally spread over provinces, take- up of new grants will be the same as the old system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every aspect of the present cabinet recommendations is aimed at limiting expenditure to the absolute minimum without the system becoming a sick joke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lund Commission was established because the Government was concerned about the future affordability of grants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission came up with projected figures of between R5-million and R20- million a year if equitable access was to be achieved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These figures are so divergent. To use them as the basis of drastic policy change is ridiculous, suggesting other motives,&quot; said Mr Barberton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The argument that the present system (of R135 a month per child) is fiscally unsustainable is based on two very optimistic and unrealistic assumptions, namely a perfect administration system and take-up rates of 100 percent. These are unheard of anywhere in the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Cosatu and the NGO Coalition have asked Mrs Fraser-Moleketi to delay implementation of the proposals and review the budget allocation to child support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NGO Coalition has given the minister until June 10 to come up with revised proposals or face action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Fraser-Moleketi, however, is standing firm. She has not given any indication that she is prepared to move on the proposals and at a conference organised by the Ecumenical Foundation of Southern Africa this week she said: &quot;There will be a time when government must take decisions that are not popular and civil society will engage the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a necessary creative tension which will only strengthen our democracy and we need to respect arguments forwarded from either side.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Olympic-related transport spending of R250-million has the potential to raise the Western Cape's gross domestic product by up to R750- million and create considerable employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was spelled out yesterday at a conference at the Waterfront.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contractors are to start work on 49 priority projects across the metropolitan area by September. They will be completed whether or not the bid succeeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investment of R250-million - which is coupled with supplemental projects costing a further R233-million - has been approved by the treasury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rob Vos, technical director of the Southern African Bitumen Association (Sabita), told the Bituminous Materials Liaison Committee meeting yesterday that research &quot;repeatedly underlined the pivotal role of roads in generating short-term employment and long-term economic growth&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This in turn leads directly to social reconstruction because people have lower transport costs, cheaper consumer goods, easier access to schools, recreation facilities, jobs and business opportunities, and entrepreneurs are encouraged to expand into areas which to date have been commercially sterile,&quot; said Mr Vos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of our findings is that a one percent growth in infrastructure value, particularly on the road network, results in a net increase in gross domestic product of between 2 and 3 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this scenario the impact of the metropolitan transport planning priority projects on the Western Cape economy must be obvious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the priority projects, most of which were in the public transport network, had been designed to provide economic links between economic hubs and dormitory towns left over from the apartheid era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They included key road, rail and interchange projects. &quot;Whether or not the Olympic bid is successful, its kick-start value in setting this process in motion will have inestimable benefits for the economy and the people of the Western Cape,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - A Khayelitsha man has described his anguish as he pushed his dying wife in a wheelbarrow from one clinic to another in a vain bid to save her life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thobeka Madayi died during the heartbreak journey after nobody would help her husband, Vuyani Magazi, call an ambulance this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Infuriated by what they regard as appalling medical services in Cape Town's townships, residents threatened to stone the cars of nurses leaving a clinic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health authorities regretted that no ambulance was called, saying the service was overloaded by hoaxes and emergencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But township residents say they have had enough of long queues and rude staff at overcrowded clinics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Magazi said he walked to the Nolungile Clinic in Khayelitsha on Wednesday to ask for transport for his wife. Staff told him he would have to fetch her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He found a wheelbarrow and pushed her to the clinic, where, he said, he was turned away because it was closing for the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Edmund Michaels, who heads the Community Health Services Organisation, said Ms Madayi was seen by a doctor about 3.45pm. &quot;It was felt that she was chronically terminally ill and that nothing could be done for her at the day hospital,&quot; Dr Michaels said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The doctor on duty had told Mr Magazi he could wait for an ambulance which was coming to fetch other people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because ambulances could take a long time to arrive, the doctor had said Mr Magazi could otherwise take her to the larger Site B clinic, which has a 24- hour service and where an ambulance might arrive sooner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Mr Magazi was wheeling his wife there she died in the wheelbarrow. He stood stunned in the street and a crowd soon gathered. When police arrived and went to the Nolungile Clinic, they were told there was nothing staff could do as the woman had not died there. And only when a bystander phoned the emergency police number was the body taken away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anne Brand, director of the Western Cape's Health Support Systems, said the incident was &quot;unfortunate&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We really shouldn't be in this position where patients are dying on the street. This would be the exception rather than the rule. I'm sorry the day hospital didn't call an ambulance to take the woman directly to hospital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Brand said the ambulance service was trying to give the best service possible but was having to weigh priorities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA) - Witnesses at the trial of former Derg officials yesterday testified that they had seen the torture and killings of members of the Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Party (EPRP) in 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corporal Zeleke Desta, and Ato Gebru Haile-Michael and Ato Zewde Mezgebu who were serving as security personnel in 1977 told the First Criminal Bench of the federal High Court that they had seen the dead bodies of five individuals.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corporal Zeleke said that he and his colleagues had spent a night guarding the dead bodies. the next morning, the father of one of the deceased asked whether his son was dead, the corporal said and added that he had refrained from telling the father the truth. The father was forced to join the revolutionary squad on the very day, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Zeleke Mezgebu, the other prosecution witness, said that he had seen the dead bodies of two individuals, whom he identified as Yodit and Ato Assefa. He said he had seen a poster which read 'EPRP' posted on the body of Yodit, and the pictures of the late crown prince and the emperor on the corpse of Ato Assefa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third witness also said he had seen the body of an individual identified as Ato Tadesse Kormesa and fainted because he thought the body was that of his brother who was imprisoned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three other witnesses, who were imprisoned said they were jailed and tortured, and were made to witness the torturing of others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers of the defendants, Brigadier General Bekele Nedi and Corporal Telahun, cross examined the witnesses, saying where there was any law that allowed the formation of political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witnesses responded there was none.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial was adjourned for May 13, 1997.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The objective of the seminar which brought together 63 participants, including observers from united nations specialized agencies and the international community was to initiate discussions on ways of enhancing the protection of human rights in Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The need for support for the mechanisms established within the framework of the OAU was stressed in this connection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among others , the seminar discussed the role of OAU organs and the obligation of States parties in the implementation of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR), the domestic implementation of the ACHPR, and the proposed African Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seminar is said to have noted that human rights violations continue to occur in many parts of the continent and recommended that human rights issues be &quot;a permanent item on the agenda of the Central organ&quot; at all levels, it was disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gathering, which also recommended that more such forums be organized in the context of strengthening the promotion and protection of human rights in Africa, suggested that 21 October be designated as African human Rights Day as recommended earlier with &quot;special dimension&quot; in Addis Ababa - the seat of the OAU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seminar was organized by the International Commission of Jurists in collaboration with the OAU and the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights.</SPAN></P>

It has further alleged that weapons were found and that Mr.  Assefa Maru and his colleagues were members of an underground organisation by the name of Ethiopian Patriotic Front.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is to be remembered that similar trumped-up charges were concocted to decapitate ETA's leadership and imprison Dr. Taye Wolde Semayat. What is clear from the Reuter's news broadcast regarding the killing of Ato Assefa Maru is that the incumbent government has tried to implicate ETA's leadership with the recent spate of bombings that took place in Addis Abeba and Dire Dawa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reuter's report which verbatim echoes police reports has stated that weapons were found. Of course this is a baseless allegation meant to justify the killing of Mr. Assefa Maru. Mr. Assefa Maru has been an elected leader of ETA. In all this the bigger prize for the Tigrean regime is the dismantling of ETA which has proved a hard nut to crack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unable to legally get rid of this organisation and having repeatedly failed to organize teachers on ethnic lines save for Tigrean teachers in the Tigrean region (the hot-bed of Tigrean nationalism), the incumbent Tigrean regime has to resort to such violent measures against a professional organisation whose only weapon is peaceful protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its radio and TV broadcast which attempted to portray ETA as violent organisation, the incumbent government sought to :</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1 - show that weapons were found in ETA's head office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This the Tigrean government can do by putting weapons in ETA head office after it has killed Mr. Assefa Maru and detained seven other ETA leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2 - prove that the recent bombings of hotels and resaturants were the work of the so- called &quot;Ethiopian Patriotic Front&quot; which is allegedly targetting foreigners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By so doing the Tigrean regime is trying to garner continued support from its western patrons who have continued to project its image as a democratic one. Remember that Dr. Taye was accused of being the alleged leader of this organisation and for allegedly masterminding an attack on US premises and US ctzen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is apposite here to let readers know that the court which was deliberating on the case of Dr. Taye on February 28, 1997 has dismissed and rejected as unfounded the charges that were brought against Dr. Taye by the icumbnet Tigrean government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3 - to do away with ETA and decapitate its leadership by taking such violent actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's violent posture against a legally constituted civic organistion heralds a new turn in the anti-democratic record of the Tigrean regime. It is also meant to give a warning signal to ETA leaders like Mr. Gemorraw Kassa who have so far proved a hard nut to crack. It is a preemptive measure to undermine the growing solidarity being shown to ETA by international organisations like EI, western institutions, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contours and pattern of the present move of the Tigrean regime are not difficult to discern. Look what they did to CETU. Legally they failed to get rid of CETU. So according to the letter which was recently posted on EDDN and received from CETU's leaders who escaped to neighbouring Kenya, the Tigrean regime was trying to imprison the CETU leaders by concocting trumped-up charges against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luckily they were apprised of the plot and were able to escape arrest. The fact that the Tigrean regime should pick out and blame a non-existent so- called &quot;Ethiopian Patriotic Front&quot; for the bombings that took place in a country where there are more than half a dozen armed movements which have made their presence a public knowledge shows how determined this regime is to decapitate the two organised memebers of the Ethiopian civil society (ETA and CETU).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent replacement of CETU by a puppet organisation in the image of EPRDF is a case in point. Now the same will happen to ETA once its genuine leadership is decaptiated. Who will be next ? It is any one's guess. Infering from the recent posting of one of TPLF's supporters on Ethiolist, we would say that the next group which will be targeted by EPRDF would be EHRCO. We do not know how and what EPRDF is going to concoct to justifly EHRCO's demise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But surely we know that EPRDF is going to establish its &quot;Human Rights Commission&quot;. That at least is what we have infered from a recent posting on Ethiolist by one of EPRDF's ardent supporters who usually releases such test baloons. Any way we have to be vigilant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let us not forget how the Nazis burned the Budstag or German parliament and blamed it on the Jews. Today we are witnessing similar things in Ethiopia.  Look how EPRDF has tried to concatenate or connect the recent bombings in Addis Abeba and Dire Dawa with the non-existent &quot;Ethiopian Patriotic Front&quot;.  Any body remotely acquainted with the TPLF (EPRDF) and its rise to prominence cannot for a moment loose sight of the fact that EPRDF leaders and cadres can go to any length to prolong their political tenure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EPRDF leaders and cadres and their supporters know no scruples and their actions know no moral boundaries nor have moral thresholds. We in SHINE express our grief about the untimely and cruel death of Ato Assefa Maru and pass our condolence to the family of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Assefa Maru. Blessed be his soul !!!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - South Africa's national deputy speaker of parliament, Baleka Mbete-Kgositsile, insists that it is in everyone's common interest to ensure that politicians don't have to stand in queues, so that they can get on and do the &quot;important&quot; work they were elected to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Explaining that she is an abnormally busy person, with a constituency in KwaZulu Natal, an office in Cape Town and children scattered all over the country, Mbete-Kgositsile insists there is nothing wrong with a little &quot; facilitation&quot; to avoid queues at airports or government offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if this appears to be an abuse of the power entrusted in her, then she regrets the perception but she is not sorry for her actions as she did nothing wrong, Mbete-Kgositsile insisted in a public letter this week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She followed all the normal procedures and was tested by the most senior official in the province, so how could it be illegal?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She can not, however, remember exactly what this test consisted of, or what the official who tested her looked like or even how she got to Johannesburg from Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor can she explain why it would be quicker, as a busy person, to drive all the way to Delmas to be tested when she could have followed the procedures like everyone else in Johannesburg where her children live, in Cape Town where her office is or in Durban where her constituency is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also conceded that there were factual errors on her application forms, which she insisted she had filled in and signed in person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look, I am not saying the politicians are not normal human beings. I queue at the ATM, the supermarket and the doctor. I have even queued at the bank - it is rare, but I have done it,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is just ... that if you want delivery ... there are situations where people must realise that it is in the common interest that things should be facilitated for certain people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It doesn't seem that the deputy speaker is alone in her views, following her confirmation that she had heard that three other female parliamentarians were also scheduled to be tested &quot;with all the necessary respect&quot; at Delmas on October 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They did not turn up, and Mbete-Kgositsile had not heard what their names were.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit- What started as a small favour amongst friends, to make life a little easier at the top, has instead revealed massive corruption, intimidation and victimisation within Mpumalanga's law enforcement agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Moldenhauer Commission, which was established three weeks ago on the strength of Sunday Times' original report about alleged irregularities in two licenses issued to Parliamentary deputy speaker Baleka Mbete-Kgositsile, has heard that special licenses for friends, family and paying clients is in fact a multi-million rand business in Mpumalanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is so prevalent, the Commission has been told, that officers who were afraid that the extent of their activities would be discovered by newly appointed investigators who had not yet been &quot;assimilated into the department's culture&quot;, actually torched their own R1,2-million Test Centre in KwaMhlanga two years ago to destroy license records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ploy worked with everyone except a tenaciously stubborn junior officer, John Muller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muller found out that a license had been secretly issued to one Baleka Mbete of Cape Town and that the matter was considered so confidential that no official records were kept of the licenses.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had no idea who this person was until, one day, while I was sitting in my car listening to the radio, I heard her name. I already knew that the information had been covered up once, so I immediately went to the press,&quot; he told the Commission this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Safety &amp; security MEC, Steve Mabona, immediately accused Muller of being a racist counter-revolutionary who could not accept that black women had the right to drive, and suspended him from work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabona continues, when not in hospital being treated for stress, to insist that there was nothing special or irregular about the arrangements he made for Mbete-Kgositsile. In fact, he says that he would do exactly the same for any South African citizen who asked him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, what exactly did Mabona do for the deputy speaker?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to testimony and documentary proof before the Moldenhauer Commission, Mabona ordered his traffic chief Henry Brazer to organise for Mbete-Kgositsile to be tested for both her learners and drivers licenses &quot; with all the necessary respect&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To ensure this, he sent his own luxury State-issue vehicle and personal bodyguards to fetch her from Johannesburg and escort her to Delmas for the test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazer apparently held Mbete-Kgositsile in such high esteem that he got out of his sick bed, where he was convalescing after a minor heart attack, phoned his brother-in-law chief traffic inspector Frederick Bezuidenhout and ordered him to fetch all the necessary forms and stamps from the Kabokweni Test Centre safe after-hours and without informing the centre manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, on the morning of October 1, he drove almost 350km from Nelspruit to Delmas, where he personally tested Mbete-Kgositsile for both licenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not wishing to inconvenience the deputy speaker too much by making her write down her own answers, Brazer decided to give her an oral learners license test - usually reserved for illiterate or similarly impaired applicants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After she did &quot;extremely well&quot; in the test, he then took her out into the streets of Delmas in a State issue Jetta VR6 for her drivers license test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazer forgot, however, to tell her that he was not registered as a certified testing officer, nor that she wasn't legally entitled to be issued a driver's license on Kabokweni License certificates unless she lived in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbete-Kgositsile, in turn, was seemingly so used to officials making life easier for her that she failed to remember vital parts of the practical test she supposedly took and repeatedly insisted to the Commission that she had not been required to execute a three-point turn or an emergency handbrake stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transport Department officials point out that Mbete-Kgositsile's drivers license test was therefore incomplete and is invalid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deputy speaker also claimed not to remember how she got from Cape Town to Johannesburg just before the test, nor whether Brazer was wearing a uniform when he tested her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbete-Kgositsile was adamant at the Commission that she had done nothing wrong and had followed all the procedures &quot;a normal applicant would&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She failed, however, to explain why she had decided to travel from Cape Town to Delmas to do her license despite having no personal or constituency ties to Mpumalanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three days later, she released a statement saying that she regretted if it had looked like she had used her influence to &quot;jump the queue&quot; but lashed out at newspapers which interpreted her statement as an apology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazer was scheduled to testify before the Commission twice this week, but a second stress-related heart ailment was unfortunately more difficult for Brazer to shake, forcing him to book himself into hospital under a pseudonym just hours before he was supposed to testify before the Moldenhauer Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff at the private R500-per day hospital say that he was initially thought to be suffering from stress and thrombosis related heart problems, but now appears to be fine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazer is still in hospital and has issued strict instructions that neither the name of his doctor nor any comment about his condition be released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazer is not the only senior official who booked himself off ill this week with stress related ailments just before they were scheduled to testify before the Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Mabona and his deputy, Advocate Stanley Soko, also booked themselves into Gauteng clinics near their homes, where their doctors pronounced them too ill to answer the allegations before them until late next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adv. Soko has been asked to appear before the Commission after internal investigators accused him of quashing their probe into Mbete-Kgositsile's licenses just 16-days after they were issued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three stressed out witnesses managed to postpone their appearances before the Commission to next week but earlier testimony from a flood of frustrated traffic inspectors have revealed that Brazer and Mabona ran the safety &amp; security department as their personal fiefdom, where senior positions were allegedly 'sold' to friends and family in return for favours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Junior officers who did complain about the irregular promotions and the issuing of tens of thousands of licenses to mail-order applicants or drivers who could barely control their vehicles were told, the Commission heard, to stop meddling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the persisted, they were simply transferred and told they would not be promoted ever again if they did not stop their questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; As recently as February this year, I was called in to Brazer's office and told that he had a proposal for me. He then told me that if I trained an unskilled man who had just been appointed as a principal inspector, he would finally give me my promotion and would transfer me to a big town like Standerton,&quot; explained chief provincial traffic inspector John Visagie at the Commission</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I obviously refused and have been passed over for promotion since then.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of Brazer's closest confidants, such as his brother-in-law, Bezuidenhout, and long time friend chief traffic inspector Roelf Smith, also testified how that had set up license tests for their own children, friends or Brazer's children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bezuidenhout has admitted to personally arranging a learner's license test for his daughter, Hannelie Bezuidenhout, during December 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bezuidenhout also admitted to organising both a learner's and driver's license test for his brother's daughter, Leizel Bezuidenhout, during the second half of 1996. The woman, who lives in Barberton and is therefore not a KaNgwane resident, was specially tested on a Monday when the tests are normally conducted on Wednesdays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bezuidenhout also admitted that he had personally fetched Brazer's daughter, Lindie Brazer, from Nelspruit in a State vehicle to write her learner's license test in Kabokweni after a request for assistance from Brazer during January of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I tested her and marked her results but did not personally take her home afterwards. I instead ordered one of my officials to do so - in a State vehicle. I admit that this was a favour or gift,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another distant or removed relative, from Pretoria, Hercules Visagie, was tested twice for a driver's license at Kabokweni after he failed his initial test. Two of Bezuidenhout's juniors tested Visagie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission also heard that the daughter-in-law of another witness, principal traffic officer Roelf Smith, was tested in similar circumstances at Kabokweni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most shocking aspect of testimony to date, chief magistrate Heinrich Moldenhauer said, is that it appears that although they all appear legal at face value, none of the licenses issued from least three test centres in Mpumalanga are valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, he said, was because even where tests were conducted without bribery, the centres themselves were completely inadequate and applicants could therefore not be properly tested.  Visagie told the Commission that many of the applicants who were issued with driver's licenses at four centres in the province had not been able to handle their vehicles in test yards, &quot;never mind on the roads&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visagie also said that he had personally witnessed people from as far afield as the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu/ Natal being tested for Code 10, or heavy truck licenses in small bakkies or saloon vehicles on test centre courses which were &quot;hopelessly&quot; inadequate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the centres was using a soccer field as a testing yard, while others were simply open pieces of veld. At Ekangala, where I was sent as centre head, we didn't even have offices and had to work out of our cars in an open field,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visagie insisted that he had repeatedly objected to the conditions he and his officers were forced to work under but was told &quot;not to interfere&quot; by provincial traffic director, Henry Brazer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I even told Brazer that I would refuse to continue testing applicants, because although they were being issued with legal licenses, not one single license was actually valid - I mean, these people were given licenses literally 15-minutes after entering the centres,&quot; Visagie said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Again I was told just to observe and not to interfere - but I was never promoted. Even people with only Standard Eight certificates were made assistant directors, but I remained a testing officer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visagie and a number of other officers also all testified to witnessing applicants playing up to R1500 for a drivers license. This they said, when remembering that each centre could issue up to 3000 licenses per year, represented a million rand business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of those who have testified to date have been able to even suggest how to practically address the problem, other than scrapping all licenses issued from 1989 to 1997 at the affected centres and demanding that all current license holders be re-tested.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - John Muller is the tenacious traffic cop with strong opinions who sacrificed career and income for almost two years to ensure that anyone selling &quot;licenses to kill&quot; was put behind bars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite being dismissed by his colleagues in the Mpumalanga Department of Safety and Security as a maverick and as a back-stabbing racist by his superiors, Muller has managed to convince other junior officers and officials to leak him enough documentation to bring the entire department to a stand- still.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His stubbornness, however, has cost him his state-issue car which was repossessed earlier this year, his salary which has not been paid since November, and possibly his house after his superiors stopped his house subsidy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His wife and six daughters have had to support Muller during his crusade, often foregoing normal luxuries at Easter or family visits back to the Cape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muller however remains defiantly proud of his moral stance and only seems hurt by the accusations of racism and reactionary political agendas which may reflect on his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While modest about his community activism, especially in the fight for the provision of decent services to his township, Muller does boast that he was one of the first graduates from the Ottery traffic school for non-whites in the Cape in 1972.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passionate about traffic science, Muller often talks for hours about the placement of robots or traffic flow, seemingly forgetting that laymen find them to be nuisances and not marvels.  The meticulous records and documentation he has collected since 1988 chronicle a frightening litany of money for license scams which indicate that tens of thousands of drivers were never actually tested before climbing into what Muller calls &quot;death machines&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So convinced is he that the roads are too dangerous for law abiding people to drive on, that he r refuses to teach his daughters to drive. Muller's investigation, often on his own time, forms the basis for Moldenhauer's Commission.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Steve Mabona is the Mpumalanga safety and security MEC with five bodyguards who lives in Houghton but works in Nelspruit because it would be &quot;too expensive to move there and anyway, the schools are better in Gauteng&quot; .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, instead of personally buying a house in Nelspruit, Mabona stays in an up-market rented house paid for by his department and uses a 'subsistence allowance' to cover his grocery and other expenses during the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he wants to go home on the weekends to be with his family, he flies up to Johannesburg at state expense, while his bodyguards drive his car up to Houghton at the same time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Believing in a 'hands on' approach to running his department Mabona has been called &quot;undisciplined but committed&quot; by fellow MECs and is often the first into any political fray, where he is known best for his use of strong language and lack of subtlety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His staff insist that it is this 'hands on' approach and not corruption which prompted him to send a letter ordering the re-instatement of 3000 suspected fraudulent licenses to his national counterparts, before the police investigation into them was anywhere near complete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lover of fast cars who has previously tangled with traffic authorities in Gauteng, where he allegedly punched an officer who was fining him, Mabona has fought to ensure that his is the only safety &amp; security department in the country to also control the traffic department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His no-nonsense attitude and former record as a KwaNdebele minister have left him as the undisputed constituency leader for the former homeland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This same attitude was reflected in the attendance at Commission hearings this week of at least six under-cover security officials, who openly quizzed witnesses and court officials about any testimony relating to Mabona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission chairman had to threaten the men with arrest and report their presence to Premier Mathews Phosa before they left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone daring to question Mabona or his minions are usually publicly branded as &quot;obvious racist, counter-revolutionary agents working to re- install Grand Apartheid&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Mpumalanga has taken the lead in terms of public private sector partnerships, said National Party chief whip in the Mpumalanga legislature, Chris MacPherson on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Debating the annual report of the department of Economic Affairs and Tourism, MacPherson said the province was a leader in terms of the Maputo Corridor project, as well as the water supply system to under-serviced areas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we must promote other options available, such as NGOs, concessions, and community trusts,&quot; MacPherson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said private sector participation was important to infrastructure development and that the government should avoid borrowing capital for projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have limited fiscal resources, therefore we must make use of private sector resources,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To implement this, will take much more public participation and much more work for the politicians,&quot; MacPherson said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - A shortage of state land for the resettlement of farmers has put state land under threat of invasion, said Mpumalanga MEC for Agriculture, January Masilela, on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presenting his budget speech, Masilela said only 36 000 hectares of state land was available for resettlement, and that agricultural land was fast disappearing under encroaching residential development.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The public may perceive the settlement prcess as slow- too slow to be significant,&quot; Masilela said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said only 38 farmers and four associations had been resettled during the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Invasion of state land in an attempt to establish a right to the land, has become a real threat to development and has to be dealt with significantly and decisively at political level,&quot; Masilela warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said tension in certain areas between traditional authorities and local government had also contributed to delays, as had conflict between competing farmer organisations, and individuals with their own political agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farmers accepted for the resettlement programme had been temporarily settled on lease for an initial period of three years to allow for the devolution of powers to the province, Masilela said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the three-year period, farmers would not, however get first option to buy, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should ensure equitable distribution, especially for disadvantaged farmers,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Masilela said the selection criteria for the resettlement of farmers excluded most potential resource-poor farmers, but that his department would approach the national ministry of Land Affairs and Water Forestry to make more land available for the programme. .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Debating the annual report of the Mpumalanga department of economic affairs and tourism, Mahlangu said the major concern raised by the public was the possibility of gamblers becoming addicted to gambling, at the expense of their social well-being.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sufficient care will be needed,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahlangu said there had been no political inteference in the granting of casino licences in the province, and that Mpumalanga had been the first province to grant casino licenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The notion that still prevails in sick minds that blacks cannot manage is proved wrong,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the only shortcoming was the absence of women participating in management positions in the department of economic affairs and tourism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A license to operate a casino in Mpumalanga was first granted to Global Resorts earlier this year, while on Thursday, a second license was granted Tsogo Sun to operate a casino in Witbank. .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Despite leading marches just one week ago demanding that no bail be granted to suspects charged with serious crimes, Mpumalanga's controversial ANC Youth League secretary general, James Nkambule, did not object on Wednesday when he was offered &quot;free bail&quot; after being charged with torching his uncle's shop and car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkambule, who allegedly caused R200 000 damage when he burnt the shop and car in 1992, appeared only briefly in the Barberton Magistrate's Court and declined to comment afterwards about accepting bail.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is despite personally leading a community protest march on the regional police headquarters in Nelspruit on Workers Day, where he handed a memorandum to police demanding that courts immediately stop granting bail to serious offenders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The granting of bail, the memorandum stated, enabled the offenders to both intimidate witnesses and to continue their crime sprees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Court documents indicate that the alleged arson formed part of a political struggle for power in local ANC structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkambule was released on his own recognisance until his case is heard again on August 22.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - If the South African Football Association was a soccer team, it would be facing relegation, but new CEO Danny Jordaan is hoping to make some changes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOCCER: Julian Drew</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFTER the revelations of the Pickard Commission of Inquiry and the subsequent removal of South African Football Association (Safa) president Stix Morewa, public confidence in the administration of soccer in South Africa is at an all-time low. Even the four-day soccer indaba - brought about as a direct result of the inquiry - which mapped out a new future for the sport, drew a lukewarm response in the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the key personalities who will determine the extent of Safa's success in cleaning up its tarnished image and establishing a more solid foundation for the sport is new CEO Danny Jordaan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although many people thought the position would go to a high-flyer in the business world, Jordaan brings an impressive curriculum vitae to the table and, most importantly, he has a wealth of experience in the field of football administration. An ANC MP from Port Elizabeth, Jordaan was a provincial footballer and cricketer who played for PE United during the 1970s in the Federation Professional League - the then nominally professional wing of non- racial football.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1980s he played a prominent role in the Soccer Federation as deputy president and was one of the driving forces in the unity process leading to the formation of Safa from the four racially divided soccer bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has been a Safa vice president since 1991 and is a member of the National Sports Council's executive as well as a director of the Cape Town 2004 Olympic Bid Company. On Monday he tendered his resignation as an MP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides his extensive contacts and experience in international sport one factor that could have swayed the decision Jordaan's way was his successful negotiations with the football associations of England, Holland, France and Brazil while the position was under review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordaan was instrumental in securing Holland to fill the gap left by Nigeria's withdrawal from the Nelson Mandela Inauguration Challenge and also in signing contracts for international games with the other three countries. &quot; I think during this period many of the executive members started to consider me as a serious contender and I'm happy that they eventually decided to appoint me,&quot; says Jordaan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;From walls to bridges&quot; paper Jordaan delivered at the soccer indaba also showed that he had a concrete vision for the transformation of football in South Africa and most of its proposals were adopted by Safa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we accept that you cannot just declare that people must now have confidence in Safa or football. It will only come through having an open, transparent and professionally run administration,&quot; says Jordaan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The indaba was the first step in the reconstruction of South African soccer and I think as we begin to appoint respected, credible, quality people to positions of authority and responsibility and follow that up with clearly defined plans and a programme of implementation then we will begin to generate confidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our first priority is to appoint a director of finance before the end of May. That person will be a financial expert and he will provide regular report backs to both the executive and the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There will no longer be any ad hoc decision-making that creates loopholes for financial problems. We will insist on work plans whose implementation will be underpinned by a budgetary provision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are undertaking a full audit of our financial situation to determine Safa's current position because we are going to overhaul our systems of financial management and control. I'm quite convinced that with a director of finance and strict compliance with both the work plans and the budgets we will be able to implement the necessary checks and balances.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These kinds of measures, once implemented, should reassure current and potential sponsors that their money will be properly accounted for and will assist in Safa's campaign to increase its revenue base in order to fund the changes which will usher in a bigger and more professional administration covering all aspects of the sport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordaan believes Safa has demonstrated its willingness to change and quashed perceptions that the current executive is mainly concerned with retaining its grip on power. &quot;I think many people were sceptical but the unanimous decision to restructure the executive, which inevitably means that some members will not be re-elected, and to do away with the position of treasurer, indicates that people are not interested in power but are genuinely committed to the transformation of football for the benefit of the entire football community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jordaan and Safa have clear strategies to broaden the base of the game and improve technical standards while also addressing some of the more deep- rooted problems like the bribery of referees, crowd violence and the standard and safety of stadiums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while at least for now there is a clear sense of direction and very specific goals to achieve, Jordaan is under no illusions that he has all the answers and he most definitely sees his tenure in finite terms. &quot;If I can last that long I only see myself serving a five-year term. I think that is sufficient to develop and implement a vision for South African football.  Beyond that there must be new ideas and new people to take the process forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should Jordaan see out his term, besides expanding Safa's membership base from its present 1,4-million to 5-million, he has several key goals that he would like to achieve during the next five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would like to see us compete in two World Cups and win the right to host the 2006 World Cup. To have one of our under-17 or under-20 teams in the finals of the world youth championships (already realised) and to have our under-23 team participate in the Olympic Games. To do that requires us to create an integrated and comprehensive development programme driven by committed and visionary technical people. We will be appointing a technical director and qualified technical staff on a full-time basis and although it is a massive challenge we face it is definitely achievable.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A clash between Soweto giants Chiefs and Pirates is always a heated affair, but with both teams desperate for maximum points Saturday's match is bound to be a sizzler</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOCCER: Andrew Muchineripi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ONE does not require an advanced football coaching certificate to realise that Orlando Pirates striker Jerry Sikhosana is going to receive careful attention when they confront traditional giants Kaizer Chiefs in the Castle Premiership on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man known as Legs of Thunder has crucified the Amakhosi this season, scoring a hat-trick in the 4-1 Bob Save Super Bowl semifinals rout and the only goal when they met again in the first round of the championship.  Sikhosana has had his ups and downs, forcing his way into the national team only to lose his place last month following the World Cup defeat in Pointe- Noire, where he never seriously threatened the Congolese defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if anything can inspire a Buccaneer to produce his best it is the sight of those black and gold shirts, which will bear the logo of new multimillion- rand sponsors Total for the first time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The match at FNB Stadium is of paramount importance to both clubs with the losers virtually waving goodbye to any hope of catching surprise packets Manning Rangers in the chase for the R500 000 first prize. Rangers, alias the Mighty Maulers, enter the weekend on 61 points with five matches left, Chiefs have 58 with four to go and Pirates 54 with six fixtures outstanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fat is truly in the fire. If Rangers defeat QwaQwa Stars at home on Friday night and the big showdown finishes all square, the chances of the title returning to Durban after an absence of more than a decade will be greatly enhanced. So think of whatever clich' you wish ... do or die, make or break, all or nothing, win or bust. They all apply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiefs and Pirates desperately need the three points because a draw will favour only Rangers. Chiefs' coach (oops, sorry, youth development officer) Jeff Butler once commented that only journalists were foolish enough to predict the results of football matches, and in this instance his advice makes perfect sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not even the most dyed-in-the-wool member of The Ghost could have dreamt that Sikhosana was going to rip Chiefs' defence apart like a flimsy piece of worn cotton when the teams last clashed at Soccer City. The nightmare continued at Ellis Park as the former Witbank Aces striker pounced on a moment of defensive indecision by Jacob Tshisevhe and drove the ball past goalkeeper Brian Baloyi at the near post. Baloyi knelt, head down, while a visibly shaken Tshisevhe picked the ball from the net.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the defining moment of a match missed by suspended national captain Neil Tovey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fair-haired guardian of the gates to Chiefs' defence has since lost his place in the team and the captaincy of Bafana Bafana and nobody will observe his performance this weekend more closely than the man so many fans hate to love, national coach Clive Barker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tovey against Sikhosana, Gavin Lane against Mark Williams, Dumisa Ngobe against Isaac Kungoane ... the list of enthralling individual clashes is never-ending and let us hope that each physical contest is fierce, and fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The likely outcome? Even Butler will surely agree that one moment of magic or madness will probably determine whether black and gold or black and white become the most popular colours in South Africa come dusk on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rangers began the second half of the Premiership programme with a late victory over QwaQwa in an undistinguished match where even the winner from Big George Koumantarakis had an element of luck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a visit to Pirates scheduled for the final weekend of the season, Rangers will want maximum points from Stars, Vaal Professionals, Bush Bucks (home) and Real Rovers (away) to try and ensure no last- round heartache.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The methodical ruthlessness with which the Maulers mauled Aces in Witbank last weekend suggests coach Gordun Igesund, unsung right-hand man Afzal Khan and the boys in blue and yellow can do it. They may never get a better chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equally fascinating is the struggle to avoid relegation with bottom-of-the- table Aces still insisting they can perform an escape act to embarrass even Houdini.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all the optimism of coach Steve Haupt, the Coal City Giants appear doomed unless they win their remaining five matches, which will not be easy considering the previous 29 have produced only four triumphs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It promises to be quite a battle out Witbank way on Sunday, given that the visitors are Amazulu, the present occupants of 17th position, which also carries a relegation tag come the end of the season.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It is a sad state of affairs when the top sides in this country are left to fight it out among themselves for the scraps of the Super 12 semi-final berths. But, as things currently stand in the maelstrom of the three-nation provincial competition, this is indeed the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the Auckland Blues, Wellington Hurricanes and ACT Brumbies firmly astride the top of the log and all looking almost certain starters for the play-off stages, the fight for the fourth semi-final spot lies between Natal, Gauteng and Northern Transvaal - none of whom are likely to amass enough points in the two games remaining to ensure home-ground advantage in the play- offs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this respect it is also a case for some bewilderment that Free State, the unheralded Cheetahs who have played some of the most unhindered and enterprising rugby of the competition, will probably be the whipping boys.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Free State face Canterbury in Bloemfontein this weekend in a match where victory for the Cheetahs will surely only mean the addition of some extra breathing space for the other South African teams from a side which was unlucky not to beat Natal and then recorded the only white-wash to date over the wounded Luyt Lions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the knowledgeable - if at times petulant - tutorship of Helgard Muller, Free State have been a revelation in Super 12 company this season, and it remains an enduring mystery why the South African Rugby Football Union's brainstrust had any doubts about their fitness to take on the best sides from Australia and New Zealand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Natal remain the best shot for a spot in the last four, needing only two points from their remaining two matches against the Blue Bulls and Gauteng to see off any chance the Waikato Chiefs have of making the semi-finals on a strictly arithmetical formula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But both Northerns and the limping Lions are still in with a shout if they take the full 10 points still available with the try bonus on offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Gauteng, this looks to be an impossibility. This weekend they face the lately re-awakened Queensland Reds at Ballymore in the last match of what has been a truly disastrous tour down under.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Predictions in Super 12 have proved all but impossiible, but the Lions, lacking the input and drive of players of the stature of Kobus Wiese, Ian Macdonald, Hennie le Roux and Japie Mulder through injury and fielding a side of virtual newcomers, do not look to have the guns to beat a combination that roundly humiliated Natal in last weekend's 40-3 rout in Brisbane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A loss at Ballymore will leave Gauteng stranded on 22 points and right out of contention, leaving the door open for Natal to again become the leading representative of this country's rugby among the sides of the southern hemisphere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many ways, this is right and just. Natal - despite their lapses -have proved two things in their Super 12 campaign; they have consistently been the only side with the pattern of play to match the New Zealand and Australian game, and are the only side with a consistency of logic in their coaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first undoubtedly stems from the latter and the rest of this country's coaches could do a lot worse than examine in minute detail just what it is that Ian McIntosh is doing. More especially, how he is able to consistently produce players as if from a bottomless magician's hat to suit the circumstances. This, more than anything, is the mark of a fine coach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this respect, Northerns have had their problems this season, a players' revolt ousting John Williams and Eugene van As in favour of Kitch Christie and Uli Schmidt, and then a boardroom putsch reversing the process once the playing contracts had been signed and sealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Northerns brought some brief fire back into the embers of their Super 12 hopes with a nail-biting 23-22 win over Canterbury at Loftus Versfeld last weekend, but it was anything but a convincing performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There seems to be a rudderless look to the way they go about their task.  For, while there is boundless individual talent in the Pretoria team, it is almost as if they had met for the first time on the morning of the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is best illustrated in the captaincy issue. Ruben Kruger, appointed at the beginning of the season, has made way for veteran Adriaan Richter. Add in Joost van der Westhuizen, and at times against Canterbury it was difficult to judge just who was the chairman of an on-field three- man management committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Northerns, like Gauteng, have to win everything left to them with full points and bonuses to have any chance of pulling back the seven points they trail Natal by. This Sunday they meet at King's Park in Durban and the betting must be on Natal, even if Mark Andrews will probably miss this one for the Sharks and Krynauw Otto is back to boost the Blue Bulls' line-outs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It all points to Natal making it to the semis. But they will almost surely play their first match in the knockout series away and, should they be lucky enough to get through to their second successive final, once again have to compete for the trophy on foreign soil.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Mary Benson's new book celebrates Athol Fugard and Barney Simon, writes MATTHEW KROUSE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE present era of truth and reconciliation is marked by recollections of tragedy, as well as tales of great accomplishment. It can even be amusing, in hindsight, to hear some of the stories of the &quot;struggle years&quot; - stories such as the way people had to bury caches of contraband books under floorboards and in backyards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The books of Mary Benson were prominent among those buried or otherwise hidden. Her biography of Nelson Mandela and her history of the African National Congress, The Struggle for a Birthright were among those banned by the apartheid state.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benson was a confidante of communist leader Bram Fischer, and a host of Mandela's when he left South Africa in 1962 and travelled the world seeking support for the ANC. She was also the first person, in 1963, to testify before the United Nations about the evils of apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now 77, Benson spent almost three decades in exile. She returns to South Africa now as a regular visitor - a renowned historian, journalist, activist and novelist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was on one of her visits in 1995 that her friend and regular London housemate, Barney Simon, died suddenly after heart surgery. Benson celebrates Simon - and another lifelong friend, Athol Fugard - in her memoir, Athol Fugard and Barney Simon: Bare Stage, a Few Props, Great Theatre (published by Ravan). The subtitle is drawn from a 1963 letter to Benson from Fugard, describing his plans for an upcoming production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benson and I met in a comfortable suburban Johannesburg house, on one of her recent visits. Hunting for historic photographs, she opened a large envelope, and out poured streams of rare images, taken by her - Mandela in front of Cromwell's statue; Joe Slovo and Ruth First; Fugard and, of course, Simon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benson's new book is a direct response to his death. It is also a privileged insight into the work and lives of two of the major proponents of a South African theatre now striving to free itself from political constraints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, talking about local theatre inevitably involves a discussion of protest theatre, a kind of playmaking that dominated our stages in the Eighties. Both Fugard and Simon were noted practitioners and pioneers of the genre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Benson refuses to pigeonhole Simon's or Fugard's plays simply as protest theatre. As she says, &quot;Barney said it so beautifully, in an interview he gave in Sweden. He said we should be going into people's lives, their souls, their ways of life. And if it brings in aspects of the struggle then that's okay. But it's good if it can go beyond just protesting against the horrors, and inspire people to function constructively.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been many investigations into Fugard's work (and Benson edited his journals for publication), but Athol Fugard and Barney Simon: Bare Stage, a Few Props, Great Theatre is the first and thus far only only exploration of Simon's theatrical accomplishments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who knew Simon and worked with him in South Africa were aware of his frequent departures from the country, without knowing where exactly he went or what he did. What Simon was doing, without crowing about it, was touring his productions around the world. Benson's book furnishes an account of his travels and a selection of critical accolades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simon and Fugard became major figures in world theatre, working in the world's greatest venues with such luminaries as Martin Sheen, Danny Glover, James Earl Jones and Ben Kingsley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benson's book is filled with meaty anecdotes, beyond which are deeper concerns. The protagonists battle with personal problems: there's Fugard, always drinking in earlier times; an oddly parochial figure, considering his place in the theatre world. There's Simon - single, suffering from a skin disease and frequently overworked. And then there's Benson herself, exiled, arthritic, seeking love.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a story of enduring friendships, coupled with accomplishments that leave one in awe of the three who found each other, sometime in the Fifties, in the simple working environment of Dorkay House. But times have changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ultimate question then, for Benson, tends towards the role and function of women of her generation, today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of my contemporary friends are still working in the townships, in kindergartens that they founded many years ago, while some are academics. At my age most women are retired and playing bridge,&quot; she says wryly. &quot;I'm just lucky, as a writer, that I still have the strength to plod on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barney had such an enormous impact, giving me courage, and at certain times provoking me. As with that statement of his: 'Only do dangerous things.  '&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Four plays compiled and introduced by Zakes Mda (Vivlia, R49, 99)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE earliest play here is Maishe Maponya's Umongikazi/The Nurse, dating from 1983. The premi re production toured Europe, though deprived of its two leading performers who were refused travel documents &quot;for security reasons&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was then - and indeed the play's subject-matter was itself fiercely topical, &quot;written in the wake of controversy about spending cut-backs and poor facilities at Baragwanath Hospital&quot;. Yet as, towards its end, the play moves into agit-prop and shows nurses organising to demand a better hospital service for the majority, you can see how well a fresh production might work now.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1997 an ironic sense of continuity seems to be the order of the day.  (Fine if this remains active, doesn't go senile into cynicism.) It's there again in the title of Fatima Dike's play, So What's New.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is for four women, who play a Soweto shebeen-queen, her daughter, and two friends, a real-estate saleswoman and a drug-dealer. Central to the stage- set is a TV, and central to programming is The Bold and the Beautiful: the women's comments on this soap, their attachments to favourite characters, counterpoint the &quot;real&quot; action throughout. Central to reality are the gun battles that break out around the shebeen every other night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A crucial point for Dike is the survival of the youngest character, the shebeen-owner's daughter, growing up with women who both shield her with love and concern and draw her close to their own potential for murderous irresponsibility. Her mother worries about who walks her to school; every night men proposition the schoolgirl in her mother's shebeen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Dike wishes also to emphasise the courage of these women, their ability to look after themselves, their (relative) independence from their feckless men. Dike's problematising of these women's lives and her demonstration of their strengths make for a powerful mix.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A play on women's experience, and then a play on disaffected youth, Makwedini Mtsaka's Member of Society probes the creation of the new South Africa. Its twin focal points are the rediscovery of identity amongst a fragmented and traumatised community, and the prevalence of violence. It is dedicated to the actress Kholeka Tile, killed in 1994 by unknown assailants on her way back from the play's rehearsals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, Zakes Mda's own play The Nun's Romantic Story, set in Lesotho during the 1970 State of Emergency. What Mda attempts here is highly ambitious: to depict the violence inflicted on communities who opposed the ruling party, and yet to foreground the state of transcendental calm achieved by the nun of the title, as she draws on her resources of courage and ironic humour to confront the terror that has destroyed her family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is Mda's success that he avoids making out of all this an embarrassing exercise in rarefication. His nun's story is (up until a somewhat ethereal ending) utterly persuasive, and one takes that character's courage and her sense of the transcendent, both on their own terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As compiler of the collection, Mda also contributes an introduction, discussing the four plays and giving a concise and perceptive overview history of South African theatre since the 1970s.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The word &quot;epic&quot; has been rather devalued in cinema ever since they revved up the chariots in the original silent Ben-Hur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, however, epic cinema returns to its classical roots, with the release of Ulysses' Gaze, the latest film by Greek director Theo Angelopoulos.  Over three hours, Harvey Keitel's modern Homeric hero wanders through the most forbidding backwaters of the Balkans in search of his own Golden Fleece, three reels of film from the dawn of cinema.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ulysses' Gaze is that anachronistic thing, a sombre European art film that takes cinema, and high culture, deadly seriously. Angelopoulos has something of the air of a high priest officiating over a boringly solemn ritual.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He doesn't give an interview so much as throw abstractions, in telegraphic French, rarely giving a straight answer where a quote from Borges or an allusion to Welles's camera style will do. Sidelined by the mainstream, Angelopoulos is proud of his status as one of European cinema's last great patriarchs, a good friend of Antonioni, Bergman and Kurosawa, who also counts Wenders and Oshima among his fans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ulysses' Gaze, Angelopoulos transposes the Bosnian conflict into a too vaporous mythical context. Why did he want to recreate an Odyssey for the Balkans today?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because it's the exemplary voyage, the first great written journey of the West,&quot; Angelopoulos says. &quot;I wanted to move from the pre-history of the myth to the present.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ulysses' Gaze is as much about cinema as about history, and unashamedly uses the figure of director as hero - an existential archetype that Angelopoulos has great faith in. &quot;It's the question of the look, which is the director's tool. We don't see the world the way you do, we see it through the lens. The first time you put your eye to the camera, you discover the cinema and the world, but in different ways.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Cannes last year, Ulysses' Gaze was pipped to the Palme d'Or by Emir Kusturica's Underground, which offered a buffoonish but more specific take on Bosnia. The two films have nothing in common, Angelopoulos insists. &quot;His film is about Yugoslavia, mine is about the Balkans. My theme is the encounter between a film-maker's look from the start of the century and from the end. I don't claim to speak for the Balkans, just about things that I have seen. My voyage was an interior one.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone expecting a big Keitel performance will be disappointed. He's more like a monolith in Ulysses' Gaze, imposing and stranded in mid-landscape.  Angelopoulos feels the partnership was a success, despite an initial culture clash. &quot;I distrusted him at first, because he knew nothing. You'd talk about something that everyone in Europe knows, and he'd never heard of it. That annoyed me,'' he says, with a touch of patrician disdain. But, he adds approvingly, &quot;certain actors are famous for their silences, and there are too few silences in the cinema''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His films from the Seventies on have been ceremonial, stylised dramas of modern Greek history. He has often cultivated risk or hardship - he defied censorship by embarking on The Travelling Players (1975) while the colonels' regime was still in power, and Alexander the Great (1980) was made during winter in Greece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angelopoulos's unusually stately road movies are not easy rides, but at times justify their rigours. After watching Ulysses' Gaze, you feel you've travelled to places you never knew existed, certainly not in travel-brochure Greece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People don't say 'a Greek film' any more, they say 'an Angelopoulos film',&quot; he says. &quot;People find my films a unique experience. For me, that's much more important than spending an agreeable two hours in the cinema.'' So he thinks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Even though JOE QUEENAN is annoyed by Spike Lee, he thinks that, with the release of Get on the Bus, it's time to show respect</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I DON'T know any white people who like Spike Lee. I know white people who used to like Spike Lee, but that was before his anti-white tirades, his going to bat publicly for Mike Tyson and his perceived ubiquitousness wore out his welcome with the race that runs the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From the moment his career took off, Lee has been dogged by paradoxes. He has become the champion of an underclass to which he does not actually belong.  Once the media discovered that he was not an oppressed innercity youth but the product of a thoroughly middle-class background, many decided he was a fake.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor did Lee's masquerading as a pop revolutionary win many plaudits: real revolutionaries do not do Nike commercials, hang out with Michael Jordan or have courtside seats at Madison Square Garden. In the eyes of most whites, nobody with courtside seats there has the right to criticise American society.  People in the cheap seats can criticise American society all they want. You Woody Allens better keep your damn mouths shut. You too, Spike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All this notwithstanding, I would like to say a couple of things in Spike Lee's defence. In portraying the misfortunes of a class to which he does not belong, he has done nothing that has not been done a thousand times. Do you think Bruce Springsteen actually worked in a factory?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More pertinently, Lee deserves credit for not going Hollywood like Eddie Murphy or Whoopi Goldberg. Unlike many African- American artists who are black when it's convenient, Spike Lee is black 24 hours a day. Had he chosen the obvious path after his college film School Daze, he would now be churning out formulaic $45-million comedies about the misadventures of lovable black suburbanites instead of making his $2,8-million film Get on the Bus, about black men riding to the Million Man March in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee has continued to make complex, thought- provoking films. When white directors shun Hollywood and persist in making complex, thought-provoking films, they get academy awards. When Spike Lee does it, he gets dissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That pretty much constitutes my defence of Spike Lee the man. The Spike Lee who pauses in the middle of an interview to tell me how glad he is that sex offender/basketball star Richie Parker got a second chance, is either a complete enigma or a complete ... well, let's not get personal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Look at it this way: either he has devised some idiosyncratic philosophy whereby all these contradictions cohere, or he does this stuff because he knows it really annoys people. Having just interviewed him, I think that he does it because he knows it really annoys people. He's not mean or vulgar or belligerent or unfriendly. Just annoying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't think he's simply a &quot;world-class hustler&quot;, to use one critic's dismissive term, a calculating huckster who says annoying things because he thinks it will sell more movie tickets. I think Lee honestly believes artists have a sacred obligation to get under the public's skin, rock the boat, boldly don the mantle of annoyingness. It is a mantle he wears quite well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, Spike Lee the man has drawn so much attention to himself that he's diverted attention away from Spike Lee the film-maker. Looking at Do the Right Thing, Jungle Fever or Malcolm X, you have to wonder exactly what all the fuss about Lee's racial attitudes is about. Spike Lee the director makes films that are nuanced, sensitive and remarkably free of political cant. In a society where white people get all bent out of shape about the way they're depicted in his films - most of which they have never seen - it is his treatment of black people, particularly black men, that should be the most controversial subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From the crackhead thug in Jungle Fever to the one-dimensional pussy hound in She's Gotta Have It, Lee has not hesitated to portray members of the black community as unappealing figures. Certain white critics are hot and bothered about the alleged anti-Semitic portrayals in Mo' Better Blues, but few notice how regularly, and mischievously, Lee has used his films to satirise his own ethnic group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And one of the things most remarkable about his films is how accurately he portrays whites. Name a film where a yuppie schmuck has been brought to life with more precision than Tim Robbins in Jungle Fever. The same can hardly be said of major white directors' depictions of real black lives. &quot;What people don't realise is that when you're a minority you know everything about the majority culture, because you're bombarded with that every single day,&quot; Lee patiently explains to me. &quot;Hispanics, Asians and African-Americans know about white culture, because that's all we see. That's always on television, radio and in the newspapers. The reverse is not the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His difficulty raising cash for a long- planned Jackie Robinson biopic in the wake of the cost over-runs on Malcolm X and the far-from-thrilling response to Crooklyn, Clockers and Girl 6 is no doubt one reason why he's just finished making a quickie for $2,8-million. Get on the Bus is funded by African-American men such as Wesley Snipes and Danny Glover, and stars Ossie Davis, Isaiah Washington and other fine performers, all of whom worked for a cut of the profits. The characters include a gay couple, a cop, an elder statesman, and a father and son shackled together by court order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The obvious question is: what kind of movie can you make for $2.8 million? &quot; A very good one,&quot; Lee says. &quot;You just don't have a lot of the toys. You don't stay at the best hotels.&quot; Although at first glance it might seem like a &quot; typical&quot; Lee project, and yes, over and over he uses the same techniques, the same cadre of actors, and yes, he lets them drone on and on, thematically no two of his movies are alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to this man of few, and carefully chosen, words, you would never guess his films are long and talky. But in some of his films, the cameraman seems to wander off for long naps, leaving his equipment on autopilot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The director Lee most resembles is not Woody Allen - another short, bespectacled narcissist with courtside seats whose acting leaves something to be desired - but Eric Rohmer, the French master of film-as- meandering- conversation. A noticeable features of Lee's films is his affection for the arty techniques, weird setups, characters talking directly into the camera.  On the negative side, his heavy- handed sermonising, his gnawing fear the audience still hasn't got the point, has led to interminable finales. A friend of mine says Lee needs to go to Film-Ending School.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a mildly pretentious, wishy-washy, white suburbanite, I can say that nothing Lee has ever said about white people has offended me, not even his request to be interviewed by black journalists because he is weary of being subjected to hatchet jobs by mean- spirited white people like me. But his inability to wrap up his films really gets on my nerves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I bring up this problem in the context of Mo' Better Blues, he insists the film cannot end on a downbeat note, with Denzel Washington staggering out into the rain. It must end with the older musician teaching his son how to play the trumpet, but allowing him to cut his lesson short and go out and play football. This shows the character has grown emotionally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I drop the subject by noting that anyone who'd force his child to play the trumpet is by definition a monster incapable of personal growth. Lee seems amused. I ask if he pays attention to criticism of his work. &quot;It depends who's giving the criticism,&quot; he says. Fellini once said that his idea of the perfect vacation was to make a movie. Does Lee share this attitude? He does not. &quot;To me, making movies - which I love - is still hard work. It's not a vacation. But giving interviews is even harder.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - GWEN ANSELL profiles Brice Wassy, 'king of makossa' and one of the performers in the Afrika Oye! concert performers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAMEROONIAN music found its international fame with Manu Dibangu and Soul Makossa. So, initially, did the imported star of tonight's city hall rhythmfest, drummer Brice Wassy. But there's rather more to Cameroonian music than makossa, and Wassy's career tells much of the story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makossa - Cameroonian base with continental and European spicing - was always a slightly soft, if highly accessible, musical option, based as it was on the rhythms of children's clapping games. Dibangu himself admitted as much: &quot;It's not traditional ... it's an Afro-European music.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back home, though, there were many other traditions to draw on: balafon, rattle and drum music, rhythms like the man'gambe of the Bamileke people, the urban guitar and rhythm music of Douala and Yaounde (assiko) - and the most influential sound for current Cameroonian pop (outside of Zairean soukous), the bikutsi rhythms of the Beti people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bikutsi, faster, harder and more rhythmically complex than makossa, with solos that are jagged rather than melodic and layers of xylophone patterning, was first modernised and popularised in the late 1960s by the legendary singer Mama Ohandja, who turns up, along with Dibangu, as a guest on Wassy's latest album, the launch pad for his South African concerts, N'Ga Funk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wassy (who also appears in the reference books as Wassi or Wouassi Brice) went to Paris in the mid-1970s after a long spell jamming around the clubs of Yaounde and joined Valerie Lobey in Dibangu's drum team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like most other Paris-based African performers, he also worked with the francophone constellation - Pierre Akendengue, Francis Bebey, Wally Badarou, Toure Kunda et al - and on countless studio gigs, one of which led to work on Salif Keita's first solo album, Soro, in 1987. He stayed with the Malian for six years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Wassy's tastes spread broader than Afropop. He gigged in the United States with Colin Walcott, doyen of world music percussionists, and with free jazzer, trumpeter Don Cherry. He was producer on Jean-Luc Ponty's 1991 African flirtation album Tchokola. (The song was one of Wassy's, and reappears on N'Ga Funk. It's also the name of his current band.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, other things were happening in Paris. The programmed beats of ambient, techno and drum'n'bass were colonising the clubs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the &quot;second-generation&quot; of bikutsi broke on to the scene, in the sex, drugs, rock'n'roll formula of that most audacious of Cameroonian bands: Les T tes Brul'es (Singed Heads).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you've never heard Les T tes, Wassy's music sounds totally without precedent. If you have heard them, you can see the roots he's growing from.  The group shared with Wassy's current band a taste for bikutsi rhythms, for futuristic sound-desk effects, for a solid funk groove and for high-speed energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wassy, however, steps outside the formula in several directions. Bikutsi is only one of the several Cameroon rhythms he draws on. And he uses those rhythms in a much more complex and sophisticated way than Les T tes Brulees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He sets real balafon, djembe, cabassa and woodblocks against synclaviers, a cello and a fretless bass. And so - as in Tananas' Unamunacua - texture comes to play as important a part as rhythm. With guitar partner Vincent Nguini (a Paul Simon as well as Dibangu alumnus) he slides in the direction of sinuous nightclub makossa. With four front-line horns, he creates edgy, Afro-acid jazz. With village field recordings, he conjures electric folk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Afrika Oye! concert will be held at the Johannesburg city hall tonight, Friday May 9 and in Vista Mall, Mamelodi on May 10</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is intense, sometimes experimental music, miles from the superficial obsession with &quot;atmosphere&quot; and exoticism which dominates much Afropop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because it retains its base in groove, it's also a highly danceable formula for anyone whose ears reach beyond the thumpingly obvious. How much of his studio sound Wassy can bring to a live stage we'll hear tonight - but his complex, many-stranded vision of &quot;third-generation bikutsi&quot; will certainly survive the journey.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - 'That's not the exact history, it has to be corrected,&quot; says Margaret Dongo of Flame, the movie exploring the part played by women - particularly combatants - in Zimbabwe's war of liberation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flame opened in South Africa in April. It has already won six international awards, been screened at Cannes and has broken box office records in Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Dongo, Zimbabwe's most famous woman liberation combatant - she first went to war at the age of 15 - and the most respected voice of opposition in the oppressive state, is not particularly happy with the film. She is especially offended that the main character Flame's driving motivation in joining the struggle is to follow Comrade Danger, the man with whom she's in love.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look at the introduction. She's already talking about looking for a husband.&quot; She thinks this negates the important role women have played in the war. &quot;Many women did not go because they were invited by a boy.&quot; They wanted to fight for their country or they went to battle because of unfairness in land ownership and education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dongo believes the film's focus &quot;looks down on women&quot; because women aren't seen to be involved in strategising, training, policy making and leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a scene in the film where Flame is summoned to a soldier's get- together. She gets raped but later forgives her attacker and becomes his lover. Was the abuse of women during the struggle also watered down in Flame?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dongo agrees that there were cases of such behaviour by male soldiers, of young girls getting raped or offering sex for food and basic supplies. But she believes the film did not portray the full brutality of rape. In addition, the film ignores the fact that rape was used as a weapon of war against women in reserves by Rhodesian soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She makes disparaging reference to the kind of men who say: &quot;I raped because she was wearing a mini.&quot; Dongo thinks similarly unenlightened people will say of Flame: &quot;What do you expect? That's what she went looking for.  She's always looking for men.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Dongo feels the abuse of women should not have been the central focus of Flame, she stresses the film's failure in exposing the crucial roles played by women and many of the hardships they endured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before they were combatants the women had to carry ammunition to the soldiers. They were forced to drink urine when there was no water, and there were no sanitary pads and tampons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, women were forbidden contraception. If they fell pregnant and had an abortion, the punishment was a beating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the film is not without its strong points, she says. She likes how it shows Flame participating in major ambushes. Also how it realistically portrays post-war scenes where women were &quot;sent back to their kitchens&quot; and still live in submissive dependent positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the film was released in Zimbabwe last year it caused a storm of protest from politicians. There were even those who tried to stop its release.  Dongo was not among them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The politicians wanted to stop Flame because it was launched during elections. Even before she saw the film she fought alongside director Ingrid Sinclair to bring it out. &quot;It should at least be seen first, and then criticised,&quot; she says. &quot;Sinclair should be commended for her boldness in releasing the film in a one-party state where there is no freedom of speech.&quot; The film has generated debate, she says, in future veterans should be involved in such films, that part of the reason things are left out of Flame is that the people Sinclair spoke to may have censored themselves because of fear of victimisation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - One of the largest-ever contingents of South Africans left for the Cannes Film Festival in France this week. ANDREW WORSDALE reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CANNES Film Festival 1997, which opened on Wednesday, promises to be the biggest yet. It's the film festival's 50th anniversary, expecting up to 40 000 people - industry types, journalists and stars - and South Africa is sending one of its biggest contingents in years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last big moment for the country was when Sarafina! premiered at the fest. I was there and saw Sharon Stone (truly, truly glamorous) join the standing ovation of sentiment for local star Leleti Khumalo, director Darrell Roodt and the legacy of apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the after-party numerous celebs, including Spike Lee, Peter (Robocop) Weller and producers rubbed shoulders with us locals - all desperate to get a deal. Not much came of it and the industry fell back into the doldrums.  Perhaps this year, with our new &quot;flavoured-nation-status&quot;, things will be different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first time ever there'll be government presence at the event, with Brigitte Mabandla, Deputy Minister of the Department of Arts, Science, Culture and Technology and Neville Singh, Deputy Director of the Film Department, attending. The government will be hosting a reception and is sponsoring a stand at the International Film Market to promote South African films and television. They'll lobby for co-production treaties currently being negotiated with France and Canada and will punt the country as a location for overseas productions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what's even better is they're not alone. The local arm of multi- national conglomerate Kodak is sponsoring the travel and accommodation of several emerging local industry players including producer Jeremy Nathan, stalwart production man John Stodel newly appointed chief executive officer of the Cape Town Film Market, cameraman- director Mandla Dube, Sacod administrator Carmel Adonis, intrepid Zimbabwean and Mozambican producers Joel Phiri and Pedro Pimentha and writer-actress Pamela Nomvete, most recently responsible for the TV sitcom Flat 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Persson, managing director of Professional Motion Imaging at Kodak, was keen to stress that in supporting these film-makers the company is &quot;not creating elitist groups&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In previous years Kodak has hosted a South African party with the usual wine and canapes. They'll be doing the same but the emphasis will be on the locals to actively pitch and negotiate with the invited guests, from European television to Hollywood studios.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the fact that there are no South African films in competition at the festival, Burkinabe director Idrissa Ouedreago's Zimbabwe-made Kini and Adams, starring locals Vusi Kunene and John Kani, has been officially selected and will premiere on Saturday night, a prime time slot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film's distributors (who also own the rights to Flame) will do a major push to advance the cause of distributing African cinema.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Competing with their distribution drive will be the majors. Ster-Kinekor and Nu- Metro have sent reps to coo with their usual suppliers and pick up any unusual art movies, and independents like Len Davis and Ludi Krouse of the Labia are also there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anant Singh's Videovision and production arm Distant Horizon will also be hot- footing La Croisette. The only local film they made last year, Katinka Heyns's Paljas, was submitted to the festival but rejected on the grounds that it was too long (aren't all movies?).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But probably the most important part of the festival is the endless schmoozing, the cementing of old contacts and the wooing of new ones. As producer Jeremy Nathan puts it, &quot;It represents a real opportunity for like- minded film-makers to meet.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - South African pop star Brenda Fassie has often been referred to as the &quot;black Madonna&quot;. But a local music magazine has taken the comparison a bit too far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The May 1997 debut issue of e'Vibe, &quot;the only specialist pop magazine in the country&quot;, has run an interview with Fassie titled Talking with Brenda - The unbridled truth. Problem is, in the November 1992 issue of American magazine Newsweek there appeared an interview with Madonna about her Sex book.  The title? Talking with Madonna - The unbridled truth.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">e'Vibe has lifted, almost word for word, the Madonna interview and replaced her name with Fassie's. Shamelessly plagiarising David Ansen's Newsweek interview, e'Vibe begins its story (by Kerwin Chiya) on Fassie's new album as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">e'Vibe: So do you think you can change people's attitudes with this album?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brenda: I think that it can start the machinery going for change. I do in a way see myself as a revolution at this point ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newsweek's Madonna interview, began:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newsweek: So do you really think that you can change people's attitudes with this book?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madonna: I think that it can start the machinery going for change. I do in a way see myself as a revolutionary at this point ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">e'Vibe has changed the odd phrase, but so it goes on, question after question, &quot;Fassie&quot; uttering Madonna's lines. Newsweek is asking Madonna about the experience of taking risqu' public sex and fetish photographs. Brenda has never been involved in such a project:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newsweek: Did people know who you were?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madonna: I don't think so. We didn't plan, we just drove around, and then we'd see something, go, &quot;That looks good,&quot; and jump out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">e'Vibe's version goes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">e'Vibe: Did people know who you were?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brenda: Of course everybody knows who Brenda Fassie is, but we didn't plan, we just walked around and then we'd see something, &quot;That looks good,&quot; and jump out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other changes occur in phrases like &quot;yebo&quot; where Madonna says &quot;yes&quot; or a mention of &quot;pap&quot; where Madonna refers to &quot;rice&quot;. Things became a bit trickier for e'Vibe when the Madonna interview got into a discussion on SM (Sadomasochism).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newsweek asks Madonna: &quot;What is it about bondage and SM that's interesting to you?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">e'Vibe asks Brenda: &quot;What is it about bondage and sex mags that's interesting to you?&quot; Madonna: &quot;I'm fascinated by it. I mean, there's a lot of pain equals pleasure in the Catholic church and that is also associated with bondage and SM.&quot; Brenda: &quot;I'm fascinated by it. I mean, there's a lot of pain equals pleasure in the church and that is also associated with bondage and sex magazines ... &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his editorial in e'Vibe, publisher Thabo Mosoahle writes, &quot;What you are holding this very moment is a product of months of painstaking research and planning ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attempts to contact Mosoahle or editor Andrew Molefe proved fruitless.  Fassie's managers responded that the interview was &quot;absolutely unbelievable&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian's legal advisers say that Fassie has a huge case against e'Vibe and could sue for unjustifiable defamation and that Newsweek has a strong copyright case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - For most South Africans, it seems as if winter has been with us forever, and yet it has still to arrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, since matters of climate and temperature are going to be even more on your mind in the weeks and months to come, I thought this would be a timely moment to point you to the weather forecasters of the Web. At the very least, you'll find someone to blame.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the best local weather services is Cape Town Weather Watch (http: &nbsp;//os2.iafrica.com/weather/index_ie.ht ml), an award-winning site carrying details on the most obscure weather-related information for interested parties ranging from aviators to sailors, swimmers to teachers. More general forecasts for Southern Africa as a whole ensure that it does not remain a parochial Capetonian site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Climate System Analysis Group (http://www.egs.uct.ac.za/csag/), the climatology group of the ENGEO department at the University of Cape Town, does not trade only in acronyms, but investigates &quot;climatological aspects of climate change&quot; through the use of Global Climate Models.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their weather satellite images are made available over the Internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African Weather Bureau World Wide Web server (http://cirrus.sawb.gov.  za/) provides forecasts for Southern Africa, but not nearly as well as certain foreign services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One such service is CNN Weather (http://www.cnn.com/WEATheR/), which carries four-day forecasts for 3 600 cities, as well as an Africa forecast map (http://www.cnn.com/WEATHER/Africa/forecast _map.html) and a &quot;select your city&quot; page (http://www.cnn.com/WEATHER/cities/world.ht ml) that includes Durban, Johannesburg, Pretoria, Soweto, Lusaka, Harare, Lilongwe and Maputo, but beware: the Johannesburg forecast for last Thursday and Friday, made last Tuesday, were as much as six degrees out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City.Net South Africa (http://city.net/countries/south_africa/), part of the international City.Net travel guide, provides concise weather summaries for major cities, which in South Africa's case means Pretoria, Cape Town, Johannesburg, Bloemfontein, Durban and Port Elizabeth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">weather.com's Africa page (http://www.weather.com/weather/int/regions &nbsp;/africa.html) attempts to do the same, but this is a more useful service American domestic travellers, with maps including even airport delays, but for South Africa offering only three-day forecasts for Johannesburg and Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For live links to the above sites, visit the online version of this column at http://www.mg.co.za/mg/pc/pcrevie1.htm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time you've been through all these links, you should be fully equipped to weather all nature's storms, fits of temper and general all-round moodiness (can't someone come up with some form of Prozac for Granny Nature?).  In the meantime, don't catch any sunburn. Send comments and suggestions to arthurg@is.co.za.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The new umbrella body for editors - the South African National Editors Forum (Sanef) - has quietly being taking strides towards addressing imbalances in the print, broadcasting and radio industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since its inception in October, four working groups have been created to tackle issues which have been identified as &quot;needing urgent attention in the media industry&quot;, says Sanef deputy chair and Sunday Times editor Brian Pottinger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanef comprises representatives from the now-disbanded, mostly white Conference of Editors, the Black Editors Forum and senior journalists from the electronic media, magazine world and journalism educators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sanef was established so that senior media practitioners and educators could speak with authority on matters of concern to the industry - training and corrective action, the promotion of media freedom and media diversity,&quot; says Pottinger.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The forum is currently running a series of government/media workshops in an effort to improve communication between the two parties. A neutral venue is chosen where government officials and journalists can, in a &quot;relaxed environment&quot;, discuss difficulties they experience with one another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Often journalists complain about the increasing bureaucracy in government departments with the insistence of officials and their representatives to have faxed questions sent to them. Reporters complain that this is time- consuming, while government departments argue that they do not trust the media enough to have telephone conversations where they can be quoted. All this is healthy when people start talking about it,&quot; says Pottinger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sanef executive has already raised pledges from a number of media organisations to help fund the establishment of a permanent secretariat to assist in administering the various programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four working groups established by Sanef are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The training committee where the government/media workshops are initiated.  Efforts are being made by this committee to establish a resource site on the Internet which will act as a noticeboard highlighting vacancies, scholarships and training programmes for journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rhodes University is setting up the Web site on behalf of Sanef.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This committee is also involved in training the trainers of journalism as many professors and educators of journalism have not operated in a newsroom themselves, says Pottinger. He adds that Sanef is keen to afford trainers the opportunity to work in a newsroom of a national newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the committee is involved in the long-term goal of establishing &quot; national standards of excellence&quot; for all journalists, a basic competency level for potential reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The corrective action committee which is establishing a database of employees in all media. Sanef has approached several media institutions, mainly print stables, in an effort to gauge the number of female and black employees. This, it says, will facilitate its study on whether the media industry is representative of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The third working group is concentrating on the promotion of media freedom and is drawing up a national charter to preserve freedom of speech.  Newly appointed Cape Argus editor Moegsien Williams is involved in this committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group will act as a watchdog, closely monitoring legislation which could possibly impinge on the editorial independence of newspapers and other media bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Newspaper Press Union and Sanef recently issued a joint statement outlining their support for a robust and independent free press and will establish a Free Press Forum - a permanent body aimed at bringing together all organisations who are committed to maintaining freedom of speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roadshows are planned for all nine provinces in a bid to educate the public on the importance of press freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The diversity committee is concentrating on development in the alternative media, including community-led ventures within the media industry - from community newspapers to community radio. Enterprise editor-in- chief and Sanef and Black Editors Forum chair Thami Mazwai is involved in this group</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 20-person Sanef Council of Editors will meet next month in Durban to discuss the progress of the committees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Despite denials and much dissension, a merger between two black media forums appears set to get the go-ahead, reports Jacquie Golding- Duffy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Black Editors Forum and the Forum of Black Journalists are planning to merge in a bid to preserve what they see as their common interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the plan is causing dissension in the ranks of both organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forum of Black Journalists chair Abbey Makoe denies a merger is in the offing: &quot;There is definitely no merger as far as I am aware and nothing has been discussed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, others have confirmed that meetings have been called to discuss the possible merger and some journalists are talking about the merger as if it is close to being sewn up.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certain journalists, who favour the idea of consummating a marriage between the two forums, say the move could only strengthen the position of black reporters and editors as they would speak in a unified voice to express grievances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some reporters from the Forum of Black Journalists are keen for the merger to take place, others are concerned that the Black Editors Forum may engulf the reporters' body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These reporters caution that colour is not enough to unite the two bodies, as the problems experienced by black editors are different to those experienced by black reporters; therefore separate groups are desirable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some members who have departed from the Forum of Black Journalists say they are disillusioned with the group, citing it as &quot;disorganised&quot; and &quot;wayward&quot;.  For these reporters, talk about an impending merger between the two organisations is neither here nor there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Forum of Black Journalists has to sort out its priorities before thinking about joining up with the Black Editors Forum,&quot; says one former member who refused to be named. &quot;It's a tight-knit group and either you're in or you're out. If you question some of the ideas of the Forum of Black Journalists, you are sometimes viewed with suspicion which is very unnerving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other members of the Forum of Black Journalists argue that a &quot;multitude of opinions&quot; are aired at its meetings and &quot;never is anyone intimidated not to speak&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Forum of Black Journalists &quot;is on track&quot; and committed to improving the situation of all black reporters as a pressure group as well as to acting as a platform for black reporters to vocalise their frustrations, says one member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is for this reason that some black journalists feel a merger will be advantageous - it will provide a platform for all blacks in the media profession where they will not feel the need to emulate their white colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some black editors argue that their commitment to the broad principles of the umbrella body - the South African National Editors Forum (Sanef) - should take precedence over the Black Editors Forum, but are concerned that black interests will not be preserved. A merger between the Black Editors Forum and the Forum for Black Journalists could, they say, maintain black goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, others argue that the Black Editors Forum will have to disband eventually, like the mainly white Conference of Editors, in a bid to assist Sanef in its efforts to present a united front of editors irrespective of colour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some black editors fear the dissolution of the Black Editors Forum will not bode well for the industry as the only avenue left for black editors will be Sanef.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black Editors Forum and Sanef chair Thami Mazwai has in the past defended the existence of the Black Editors Forum, saying its actions are not out of line with Sanef, although it does have a responsibility towards its black members to tackle issues which directly affect them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Black Editors Forum has led two delegations in the past, despite the formation of Sanef, and this has provided it with more leverage than the umbrella body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first delegation had afternoon tea with President Nelson Mandela in a bid to iron out differences between the president, government officials and editors. The second delegation met with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission regarding the Freedom of Expression Institute's involvement in the then-planned investigation into the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makoe says his understanding is that the Black Editors Forum would give Sanef &quot;one year's grace&quot; before evaluating its own status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanef deputy chair and Sunday Times editor Brian Pottinger argues that the forum is not at all opposed to certain groups pursuing special interests.  However, Sanef's commitment to presenting a united front is best demonstrated by editors joining the umbrella body, he says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Jacquie Golding-Duffy puts faces to the names of the applicants vying for the private television licence and gives a sneak preview of the IBA's final policy paper on private television</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INDEPENDENT producers will be displeased with the Independent Broadcasting Authority's (IBA) final private television discussion paper as it proposes that the new television channel, to be awarded at the end of the year, only has to provide 20% of local content programmes - a 10% drop from the original quota in the first document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It emerged this week that the IBA was compelled to decrease the quota from 30% to 20% as the SABC has admitted it is unable to meet its local content obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Owing to this, the IBA has instructed the SABC that it cannot have less than 25% local content on each of its three channels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While advertisers may be pleased with the drop in local programming on the new channel, independent producers, seeking more regulation and intervention, will be unhappy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insiders at the IBA have argued that it would have been inappropriate for the regulator to insist on a commercial channel fulfilling more of a local content quota than the SABC and its public service mandate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there is a need for a private television station that promises to serve viewers with a good mix of programmes, local and foreign, there are differences of opinion between advertisers and independent producers on what would rescue South Africa's beleaguered television industry. Independent producers want more local programming, while advertisers are vying for increased Audience Ratings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final policy paper also redresses the population percentage that should be catered for when the licence is awarded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Originally the IBA stated that the new channel would cater for 50% of the population when starting up. This would increase to 75% within three years and 85% of the population would be able to receive broadcasts within the licence's eight-year lifespan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the final document caters for 50% of the population when starting up, and 75% within three years and the rest of the licence's life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Available without decoders, subscription or licence fees to most South Africans with television sets, the new national television station will compete head-to- head with the SABC for viewers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fears are rife that the IBA's insistence on carving out quotas for local content and wanting to force the new channel to fulfil some of the public service mandate will stifle the commercial opportunities for the potential licence-holder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The private television document is based on the assumption - accepted by financial experts - that the new station will not only draw on existing revenue now going to SABC stations, but also on advertising revenue that will expand the television advertising cake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has been disputed by the SABC which wants to delay the licensing of a fourth channel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FACES BEHIND The APPLICANTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* MLULEKI GEORGE (49) is chairman of the Free-to-Air consortium and a non- remunerated director of the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George admits he has no television experience but says his expertise in business stands him in good stead. Currently an African National Congress whip in Parliament and senior vice-president of the South African Rugby Football Union, George was a personnel manager for an Anglo subsidiary in East London for 13 years until he took up his post in Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Free-to-Air is awarded the licence, George says it will be important for the consortium to maintain a balance between commercialisation and pleasing the person in the street. &quot;We aim to reach all viewers and cater for their needs, but at the same time we have to be deeply involved in commercialisation in order to raise funds. One of our main tasks will be geared at being financially self-sufficient so that we can be sure that the ordinary person's pocket is not affected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Free-to-Air, he says, is keen to explore regional television and &quot; specifically cater for the needs of people in outlying areas&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On what the SABC is doing wrong, George says it is not Free-to-Air's philosophy to criticise the SABC, but adds that there is a need for other television channels to be created.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The country is gradually moving towards free enterprise where strong competition will prevail. New competition can only benefit the public broadcaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot say the SABC is not doing its job as a public broadcaster because it has inherent limitations just like a private broadcaster has its own limitations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tight-lipped about its partners, George says the consortium is &quot;far too big&quot; to start mentioning names.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is, however, believed that several black-owned companies have been approached for further investment. Primedia (part owner of Radio Highveld and sole owner of Radio 702) has also been tipped as a possible partner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George is married with three children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* RAPITSE MONTSHO (43) is the CEO of Vula Television. He also owns and is MD of a production house called RM Productions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montsho says television is his life: &quot;It is all I know. Although I've been in television for more than 14 years it is not long enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experienced in all aspects of television from production to editing, Montsho worked for Worldwide Television News, one of the biggest foreign news agencies. He was also a cameraman for United States-based ABC News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He then co-founded Video News Services, before breaking away and establishing RM Productions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RM Productions is one of the largest black- owned studios and has gathered some of the most exclusive &quot;struggle footage&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Registered in 1986, it is also one of the oldest black-owned companies.  Reluctant to divulge any information on what the consortium plans to offer the viewer, Montsho was only willing to say that it would &quot;offer exciting alternative television that will be viable and sustainable&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the SABC and its public service mandate, Montsho says he &quot;cannot condemn&quot; the SABC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think they have a tall order to have to provide public service broadcasting in an environment that is undergoing transformation. Often SABC staffers committed to change have to work with personnel that do not want to see change, which results in a lot of sabotage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montsho says if Vula Television is awarded the private television licence it will have to face the challenge of securing advertising from an industry which is controlled by mostly white middle-aged males. &quot;It is not going to be an easy road, but as we are committed to delivering maximum audiences, advertisers will be forced to respond to this by purchasing air time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montsho is married with no children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* VANESSA DU PLESSIS (44) is the company CEO of Community Television Network. She also owns her own public relations and marketing consultancy - Vanessa du Plessis Promotions - and has been involved in public relations and marketing for 22 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Du Plessis says she has been researching the South African viewership market for the past eight years and has concentrated on matching the needs of viewers with that of advertisers and marketeers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Du Plessis has been involved in niche television with her company CTN Direct TV - where she provides direct television channels for selected markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We provide footage tailored to the needs of several markets, among others, the stokvel market and tourism markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By providing entertaining, niche programming to selected markets, we ensure that viewers are watching the television that interests them while at the same time we are providing advertisers with an opportunity to penetrate this market of potential consumers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Community Television Network is awarded the licence, it promises &quot;good entertaining viewing which will inform without being boring, as well as providing a growth potential for marketeers through the medium of television&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the SABC, Du Plessis says the public broadcaster is confusing both the viewer and advertiser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She refused to reveal her local and international partners, but has previously been quoted as saying that the foreign investor will be involved in training locals, mainly people who were previously disadvantaged, in television production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is married with one child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* GLADWIN MARUMO (32) is the executive director and project manager of Station for the Nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His experience is diverse, ranging from advertising and printing to teaching in a classroom, being involved in film production and theatre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marumo worked in the advertising industry for just more than three years as a media buyer and later as a copy writer. The recipient of several awards, Marumo received the first Darryl Phillips scholarship award for advertising; the John Houk award for a short film Masemb'Enja! (Dogshit); and the Amstel award for a prize-winning stage production at the Grahamstown Festival called No Good Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has also lectured in the communications department at Pennslyvania State University in the United States and was involved in several television projects abroad. Marumo headed up the Independent Broadcasting Authority's radio unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If awarded the licence, Station for the Nation, he says, hopes to provide a &quot;comprehensive television service that will stimulate the growth of the independent production sector and meet the cultural needs of the diverse South African Community&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marumo was previously quoted as saying that black empowerment and human resource development are key elements to a successful bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Station for the Nation's partners include Thebe Investments's subsidiary, Moribo Investments; film and entertainment company Interlesiure; and Nine Network Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the SABC, Marumo says he would like to reserve judgment, adding that he does not think it healthy to criticise a rival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marumo is single.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* MATTHEWS (MK) MALUFANE (39) is chairman of Rainbow Television. Since 1986, Malufane has lobbied the government, international aid organisations and the broader community for support in broadcast deregulation and extending black empowerment to electronic media ownership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malufane has extensive television experience covering more than 10 years and has studied film production abroad. He was trained at several institutions including the University of California, Los Angeles, but had to return to South Africa for fear of losing his citizenship. Vying to become South Africa's first black television network owner, Malufane founded Broadcast Interest Group (Big), a lobby group aimed at empowering black people in the media, in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Rainbow Television's presentation to the Independent Broadcasting Authority which was compiled by Malufane, he says that the consortium supports the proposal for the first free-to-air private terrestrial service &quot; to be a national service with provincial obligations and not a regional station that may be networked&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malufane says that the consortium's national network, if awarded the licence, will &quot;effectively deliver local and regional access television for differing number of hours region to region&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their submission, Malufane argues that South African broadcasters and the general film and television production industries are not mature enough to produce a constant supply and quality product that can fulfil the local content quota. Instead, Malufane says the first three years of the new private TV licensee will be to successfully attempt to transfer the creative and management skills of Hollywood to South Africans in an effort to generate much- needed revenue to plough back into the local industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malufane is married with three children.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A drive to help local communities deal with their environmental needs, so that they do not become recipients of everyone else's problems, is contained in a White Paper to be presented to the Cabinet next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White Paper, which is likely to be made public later this month, comes at a time when tree-huggers and environmentalists are not the only people taking the environment seriously. The environment has become an everyday issue for many - so much so that there's a fast-growing market for sophisticated environmental home products going far beyond the simple water purifier of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among products developed in the United States is a high-tech home test-kit for lead, carbon-monoxide, UV radon and radioactive strontium-cessium. The latter is a critical measurement for those living in the Pacific North-West who are not entirely convinced of the all-clears given by their governments about the nuclear fall-out from Chernobyl in 1986.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another interactive product provides real- time information about a neighbourhood's environmental status. It is a monitoring system designed for informed decision- making that shows current and historic levels of pollution, hospital mortality statistics, and local disease clusters - all overlaid on a map of the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No wonder that big business in many parts of the world has placed environmental concerns high on the agenda. According to Nicky Robins, environmental manager for Nissan SA, business has recognised that &quot; environmental considerations are a strategic necessity in a global industrial market&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Africa, an Industrial Environmental Forum was established in 1990 by several key industries. The forum was relatively small to start with. But membership has flourished since its 1991 business and environment conference when more than 400 delegates discussed the impact of international standards such as the ISO 14001 and the development of the international environment system standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karin Ireton, manager of the forum, explains: &quot;Business has certain driving forces. You dance to the tune of the market that you are servicing. For example, if your market is in West Germany, which is an environmentally sensitive market place, you have to follow suit. The consumer calls the tune, if they want environmentally appropriate products, business has to listen to that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robins agrees: &quot;A shift has definitely taken place during the last five years. While it could be argued that companies have jumped on to the environmental bandwagon for marketing purposes, the reality of the situation is that any company exporting to industrialised markets and countries must improve its environmental performance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She argues that consumers in Europe and the US have two considerations, apart from price, when buying. First, they want to know how much &quot;blood&quot; is on a product; in other words, what safety standards are applied in making a product. And second, they demand to know the extent to which the product is being manufactured to the detriment of the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some critics argue that imposing such standards on the developing world is problematic, in the context of radical differences between developed and developing states and their respective market hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More ironically, almost all rich countries will overshoot their year 2000 greenhouse gas emission targets, agreed to at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1990, some by as much as 40%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African government has also climbed on to the international protocol circuit by signing three international conventions: the Montreal Protocol, which looks at ozone depleting substances; the Basel Convention, concerned with trans- boundary waste; and the International Convention, focusing on the climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental activist groups like GEM would argue that many of the standards South Africa has adopted are too low in terms of the real crisis facing the country. Studies reporting on the condition of the South African environment in the 1990s claim that where coal-burning power stations are situated, annual emissions of sulphur dioxide, the main ingredient of acid rain, total between 31 and 57 tons/km - a very high figure by international standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a paper on development and the environment, Peter Ngobese and Jacklyn Cock of Wits University argue that the South African case is a microcosm of the planet's environmental degradation. The combination of northern problems like acid rain and southern problems like soil erosion makes the country one of the most polluted areas in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, 400-million tons of top soil is being washed away in South Africa annually. A calculation of the replacement value estimates that at a cost of R30/ton of top soil, the value of the soil eroded only from the KwaZulu-Natal catchments each year is not less than R500-million and could easily be three or four times that figure. In the Eastern Cape, with far higher soil loss rates, the amount could run into many billions of rand annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the crisis, a holistic government approach to the issue has been a long time coming. Although a Green and White Paper process has been under way during the last three years, it does not help that the ministry responsible has changed hands and management so often.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An initial discussion document produced last year has led to the establishment of a Consultative National Environmental Policy Process. The White Paper on the environment which has been prepared is now heading for the Cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key concern of the White Paper is to ensure that local communities are informed and are involved in the major decisions affecting their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An integrated environment management approach will ensure that the national department sets the norms and standards and, in partnership with the provinces and local government, works out ways to monitor and lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lofty aims, but they are dependent on the capacity of the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism. With limited staff and skills to draw on, the department will be hard-pressed to monitor and evaluate many of the standards it sets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real crux of the problem is that environment is low on the government's strategic priority list. As a result, the department has a small budget which needs to be stretched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robins argues: &quot;It is understandable that they need to rationalise and that they have low capacity and few human resources, but if they deprioritise the environment now, it will cost more in the long term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government must integrate its development strategies with its environment strategies, or the cost of fixing up what went wrong in the past will be too high to bear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, this is not necessarily the approach the government is taking: the growth, employment and redistribution strategy programme does not mention the environment as a consideration at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa shares this problem with many other countries. Most states send only their environmental ministers to sign the international protocols, without the big guns - the industry and treasury ministers - and this ensures that most promises are empty ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, business has set its own standards and evaluates itself. The Industrial Environmental Forum promotes the use of a holistic systems approach like the ISO 14001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concept, according to Ireton, is that a company sets standards based on environmental management systems developed to international benchmarks. The idea is that environmental management must be incorporated into a systematic framework that makes it an integral part of the whole business function.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second element of the ISO standards addresses the need to monitor and evaluate the systems put in place. They set criteria for ideal environmental monitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ireton explains: &quot;ISO at its best functions as it is designed - to be a voluntary system whereby businesses, to gain a clearance certificate, measure themselves against criteria that they themselves set&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Going the route of getting the ISO certificate can be expensive and therefore only relevant to companies where the business incentive is large enough. The problem with smaller firms is that there is less incentive to be environmentally friendly, and the state has very little capacity to monitor them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ireton points out: &quot;There is a role for government to play, but you should make it the responsibility of the people carrying out the business. If you create an atmosphere in which people only do things because an inspector is at the door, the attitude change that sees environmental issues as essential to their business practices will not occur. The government does not actually have the capacity to have so many inspectors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact remains, however, that it is the market and business that got the environment into trouble in the first place. The fossil-fuel industry is worth more than R7-trillion a year. Setting their own standards, according to international benchmarks, may satisfy a sensitive Western customer, but may be entirely irrelevant to the real South African and global environmental problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the debate to follow with the publication of the White Paper. It certainly is a policy vacuum which the government should be addressing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In a novel empowerment deal, an investment company will double your shares provided you meet a few criteria. Ferial Haffajee reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT'S an offer you can't refuse ... if you're a bona fide woman, and you can prove it by affidavit. Women Investment Portfolio Holdings (Wiphold) is offering to double the shares bought by women who take up its public share offer later this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A public share offer does not mean the company will list on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, but that it will make its shares available to the public with a view to listing in a year or two. A minimum investment will cost R2 000. This means most women will have to invest jointly.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a novel discount share option, all women who buy shares will receive an equal number of shares in the Wiphold Trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trust plans to ensure women's empowerment does not become just another buzzword. One way in which this will be done is through shares held in the trust having greater voting power than ordinary shares. The trust will also appoint Wiphold's directors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This provides a unique empowerment vehicle to ensure that women are catered for should Wiphold list. Then shares can land up in anybody's hands,&quot; says Mojela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wiphold has grown out of a smaller company, Women Investment Portfolio, which was started 18 months ago by four go-getters: Gloria Tomatoe Serobe (a Transnet executive director), Wendy Luhabe (a management consultant), Nomhle Gcabashe and Louisa Mojela (both former bankers).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We used to meet every Tuesday after work to plan our investments,&quot; says Mojela, who together with Gcabashe will work as Wiphold's executive director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four women, who all held other high- powered full-time jobs, went around the country prompting rural women involved in stokvels, savings associations, self-help schemes and community organisations to invest with them. They had meetings and lobbied hard, although sometimes regarded quizzically by rural mamas as &quot;these youngsters from Jo'burg&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their prodding paid off and soon women were lining up to invest; now they're lining up to buy shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyer Christine Qunta says: &quot;Women's investment companies have a different feel, they're more down-to-earth. Women have been saving successfully through the worst repression in stokvels and burial societies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These companies can bring about a radical change in the economy, especially if women continue to be self-reliant and raise their own money.  You don't have to rush off to a merchant bank to raise money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's what Wiphold is planning to do with its share offer, though Mojela is a little cagey about the company's existing investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she says they give preference to blue- chip companies. They already own shares in the clothing chain-store Smart Centre, an investment trust called Baobab, a rural financing company called Kind Finance Services and Radio Highveld. Wiphold has also put in a bid to buy government-owned Sun Air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company will invest in those sectors of the economy where women have the greatest oomph, be that consumer clout or in sectors where women workers constitute a majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumer goods and media companies will be among Wiphold's first selection.  It has already been Sun International's partner in a range of bids for casino licences across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But perhaps the most innovative area to watch Wiphold move into is agriculture. Mojela says it is a logical step as most farmworkers are women and agriculture is gaining a healthy slice of the export cake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Women can, for example, buy a winery farm in Cape Town. Then we can offer a share incentive scheme so workers feel they are part of the company. You know that the more you work, the more dividends will come through,&quot; says Mojela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women's investment company has struck a chord around the country with provincial businesswomen getting together to invest in Wiphold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Eastern Cape, a group of 50 professional women led by Dr Nomsa Mazwai has been yoked together under the banner of the Ladies Investment Group, which will take up shares in Wiphold. Another such group exists in the Western Cape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mazwai's task is to ensure the company has an impact on more than just the industrial heartland of Gauteng.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wiphold is taking root in rural areas, but there is a message which the company's directors will be taking on the roadshows planned once the public share offer is made. &quot;We would like to plough back profits into the company.  That needs to be made clear to stockholders; you put in your money and forget about it for two to three years,&quot; says Mojela.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In an unfavourable macro-economic environment, Gear could confound plans to provide the necessary support for agriculture, writes Asghar Adelzadeh of the NIEP in the sixth of a series on economic policy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been several attempts to specify and quantify the contribution of agriculture to South Africa's broader economy. Most concur that the sector's direct contribution to gross domestic product, employment and exports has declined significantly in the post-World War II period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agriculture, however, plays a larger indirect role in the economy through linkages with other sectors. Studies have shown that increases in agricultural production have large positive impacts on growth, employment and the balance of payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For every R1-million of expenditure on agricultural production, the overall economic output increases by R6,4-million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agriculture also has a strong multiplier effect on employment. More jobs are created in agriculture with increased production than for any other sector of the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, studies show that in the face of an unfavourable macro-economic environment, domestic policies which are aimed at encouraging agriculture to play a role in job creation and redistribution may flounder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This argument is not unique to South Africa. In a variety of countries, domestic farming policies have been unable to compensate for macro-economic policies which are unfavourable to agricultural production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Africa, the World Bank has argued for a land reform programme that concentrates on investments in the former bantustans and the redistribution of land, through market mechanisms, both of which should lead to the creation of a class of &quot;emerging farmers&quot;. The process of &quot;downsizing&quot; farm size, according to the World Bank, will lead to a more dynamic rural economy and to greater employment and income creation among low-income groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Macro-economic Research Group/International Labour Organisation policy proposals, on the other hand, place a very different emphasis on the potential of agriculture for job creation and growth. They single out investment in agro-industry and social infrastructure as the key macro- economic strategies for growth and job creation in rural South Africa. They argue that a policy which targets agro-industry creates new jobs, improves rural livelihoods, and has the potential of stimulating the economy as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How does agriculture fare under the growth, employment and redistribution (Gear) strategy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* One of Gear's central objectives is to transform the economy to an export- driven economy. A major policy initiative to enable this involves removing a series of &quot;constraints&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While domestic agricultural policies do not feature as one of the &quot; constraints&quot; hampering the economy, the implications of the policy for agriculture are clear. An accelerated approach to reductions in tariffs, subsidies, quotas and exchange controls will certainly have serious implications for a sector that historically was well-protected and was focused on local markets and national self-sufficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Gear ignores the possible role of commercial agriculture in South Africa despite its prominent, albeit indirect, role in the economy. It fails to recognise the potential this sector has for economic growth and job creation, particularly in rural areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gear also ignores the features of the manufacturing-agricultural complex - its labour-intensity and the potential for dynamic linkages with other sectors of the economy - which made it an obvious target for investment in the African National Congress's pre-election economic thinking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Gear's broad emphasis on export- orientation is, coincidentally, in line with the sub-sectors of agriculture that have the greatest potential for employment creation and growth. Exports of high value foods - vegetables, citrus, grapes and deciduous fruit - are expanding much more rapidly than field crops like maize, wheat and oil seeds, the traditional strength of the agricultural economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Horticultural farmers also employ more labour at higher wage rates than field crops and animal products, the other two main agricultural sub-sectors.  Any expectation that South African horticultural exports will experience the same kind of rapid growth rates experienced in Chile, Brazil and Taiwan must, however, consider the global environment that permitted these countries to expand their export industries so rapidly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International competition may also limit the extent to which South African agricultural exports can expand. Exporters are already competing with countries which all have the same counter-season advantage as South African growers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The potential for growth in high-value food exports and, by implication, employment growth, foreign exchange earnings and dynamic linkages with other sectors of the economy depends on international market conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International conditions may not permit the rapid expansion of exports as was the case for countries like Chile during the 1970s and early 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The employment and growth potential associated with high-value food exports must also be weighed against the costs of a free-trade oriented economy to farmers and farm workers producing field crops like maize, wheat and oil seeds for the domestic market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While exporters will emerge as winners in an open economy, the agricultural losers will be maize, wheat and oil seed farmers. Competing with maize and wheat imported from the United States or the European Union will be extremely difficult for South African farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* There is an enormous political will in South Africa for small-scale black commercial farming. Land reform, the construction and maintenance of rural infrastructure and assistance to &quot;emerging&quot; farmers are the strategies which appear to be directed towards improving the livelihoods of the rural poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small &quot;emerging&quot; farmers represent the cornerstone of land reform and rural poverty alleviation. Whether small-scale farmers will be able to grow to deliver on these high expectations in a neoliberal and open macro-economy is very much in doubt. How will &quot;emerging&quot; farmers fare under Gear and what impact will it have on rural poverty?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Gear's assistance to small-scale black farmers will be temporary and they will not be protected from market forces through the subsidies and protection that white commercial farmers enjoyed for so long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once emerging farmers have received an initial grant, assistance will take the form of &quot;streamlined extension&quot; and in the development of marketing strategies. This shift is in line with a policy that prepares new farmers for an open economy and a public investment programme that is constrained by strict Budget deficit targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The similarities between Gear and a structural-adjustment programme also means that the international experience of small farmers under structural adjustment must be instructive. Most case studies suggest that, in the absence of direct state intervention, small-scale farmers are less likely to succeed in a &quot;free-market&quot; environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the more common results of structural adjustment is the concentration of production and land in fewer hands. Under a neoliberal economic environment, for instance, the experience of maize farmers in Mexico, threatened by highly subsidised maize from the US and Canada under the North America Free Trade Agreement, indicates that the ability to respond effectively to international competition depends on the scale of the operation and on direct state assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While large farmers with access to credit and marketing institutions were able to diversify and modernise production, small farmers found themselves without institutional support in a market-driven economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For small-scale farmers state assistance was vital, but in a neoliberal macro- economy, they were left largely destitute of institutional support, precisely at a time when they need full access to these services to modernise maize production and diversify cropping patterns towards higher value crops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Finally, Gear's emphasis on small-scale farming must be measured against its potential for alleviating and eradicating rural poverty. There are two issues which suggest that emerging farmers cannot be the only solution to rural poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first is that rural land reform programme that is aimed at increasing the efficiency of &quot;emerging&quot; farmers is unlikely to reach the poorest households and is much more likely to assist farmers who are already earning part of their income from farming. The second issue is that even if a small- farmer scheme were successful in targeting the rural poor, it is doubtful that enough farmers could be targeted to have a meaningful impact on rural poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current estimates suggest that there are about 11-million poor people in the rural areas. A land-reform scheme that is successful in creating 50 000 additional new small-scale farmers would, however, not have a major impact on the millions of rural households who have depended on wage incomes in order to survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small-scale farming, as the lynch-pin to land reform, thus faces two overwhelming challenges: first, it is not likely to benefit from a neoliberal macro-economic environment; and, second, those farmers who are successful will not be numerous enough to have a significant impact on rural poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Gear is silent on the role of commercial agriculture, its emphasis on export promotion is in line with those sectors of agriculture that are already expanding rapidly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The success of rural poverty alleviation for wage-workers in this sector depends on improving conditions through equity schemes and union organisation.  Unfortunately, both of these are in a sense voluntary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gear's emphasis on smallholders is highly problematic, given the equal or greater emphasis it places on fiscal austerity and an open economy. Local and international evidence suggests that smallholders do not fare well in a neoliberal environment and that when they do, it is through state support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article is based on a paper commissioned by the Land and Agricultural Policy Centre from the National Institute for Economic Policy and written by Dr Charles Mather of Wits University's Geography Department</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The half-day strike organised for Monday by the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) appears set to go ahead, despite talks planned for Saturday aimed at suturing controversy around the draft Basic Conditions of Employment Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government and labour are optimistic of a settlement at the talks, but business is still at odds with the Bill. Business would like to see concessions on the Bill's call for issues such as a shorter working week, overtime pay, longer notice periods and three days family-responsibility leave.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the executive director of the National Economic Development and Labour Committee (Nedlac), Jayendra Naidoo, said good progress had been made in negotiations this week. &quot;The main issues on the table have been covered,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negotiators were tight-lipped about the details of gains won at previous talks. But Cosatu was upbeat, while the government was said to be mooting amendments to the Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An already fraught week was intensified by business's decision to apply for a court order declaring Cosatu's planned strike unlawful. However, Cosatu appeared to have complied with the Labour Relations Act (LRA) and notified Nedlac within the time limits of its protest plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Business South Africa (BSA), its court action was less about whether Cosatu had got the technical requirements of the Act right, and more about whether the union was sticking to the spirit of the Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BSA complained that negotiations on the Bill had not yet reached a deadlock and that it had only been a fortnight since it was tabled. &quot;We are not trying to be vexatious, but the Act seeks to enshrine conflict resolution,&quot; says BSA's Adrian du Plessis. &quot;Problems have to be settled around a table, not on the streets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And although this week's negotiations at Nedlac were said to be cordial and mature, labour was angry at business's action. &quot;BSA has not moved an inch (in negotiations),&quot; said Cosatu's assistant general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi. He added that business had objected to socio-economic strikes since the negotiations around the LRA began and said court action was a way of continuing its protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether there had been a legal wrangle or not, there appears to have been no turning back from the strike action by Cosatu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday's protest is a shadow of the first campaign outlined by Cosatu, which aimed for a full-day strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plans are already in place: buses have been hired, posters put up and pamphlets printed and delivered. In Mpumalanga, union officials have been taken off normal union work to devote themselves to organising the strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosatu's regional office in Cape Town complained of some intimidation by employers, but marches starting at midday have been organised around the country in all major centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of Cosatu's regional offices said they would be able to cancel Monday's action, if negotiators settled the dispute this week, by using community radio stations and the SABC. Vavi, however, said: &quot;It's not possible to call off a strike in a day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A resourceful organiser in Cape Town had a solution: &quot;We may even turn it into a victory celebration.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - De Beers has lost another lucrative source of African diamonds. This time to a new contender linked to mercenary group Executive Outcomes. Chris Gordon reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRANCH Energy Angola, the company linked to South African mercenary operation Executive Outcomes, has received a new mining concession from the Angolan government, making it one of Angola's most significant - and valuable - mining operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concession - coming after a few months of strained relations with the Angolan government last year - threatens to knock yet another jewel out of the De Beers's diamond crown. Angola is one of the world's top producers of high-quality gems, with diamond sales worth an estimated $1-billion a year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Branch Energy Angola is a subsidiary of DiamondWorks Angola, in turn a subsidiary of a Canadian company listed on the Vancouver Stock Exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By November, Branch Energy's operation in Angola had reached a low point.  The company had to decide whether to expand or pull out, only months after their concession was formally agreed by the Angolan government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrest of 21 of Branch Energy's operatives in their Luarica concession, before access had been granted last September, was followed by reputed difficulties with the government over the formation of DiamondWorks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Branch Energy's response was to offer the government an upgraded operation, using the capital from the DiamondWorks flotation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company put in additional strategic infrastructure, and reorganised its management. It bought an IIuyshin 76 and installed a powerful telecommunications system in Luanda linked to the Johannesburg telephone exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saurimo, in the diamond-rich Lunda Norte province, will become a customs post so mining equipment can be flown in direct from South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The objective, according to Branch Energy, is to provide logistical support for companies wanting to invest in Angola, as well as supporting Branch Energy's own expanded operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This strategic approach extends to mining, which the company describes as &quot; security- led&quot;. Teleservices, the Executive Outcomes- owned Angolan security firm, is sent in first to secure the mining areas, before mining operations commence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Branch Energy's own diamond security in Luo is headed by JC Erasmus. Like many of Branch Energy's South African staff, he is a former member of apartheid South Africa's notorious Civil Co-operation Bureau death squad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erasmus is also a shareholder in DiamondWorks. Asked about Branch Energy's relations with Executive Outcomes, he described them as &quot;good friends&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The diamonds from Luo are valued at $400/carat by DiamondWorks, with diamonds from the Luarica concession valued at $600/carat. They expect to produce 10 000 carats a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Branch Energy's latest acquisition is the vast Alta Kwanza concession - 18 000km2 region in Bie Province, Unita's heartland. Bie Province is thought to have been mined by the Angolan opposition group since the early 1980s.  Relations with Unita are said to be amicable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luo is Branch Energy's first operational diamond mine, although their earliest diamond mining concession was the 1995 contract for the Koidu kimberlite pipe in Sierra Leone. The contract was awarded over the heads of Sunshine Mining and Diamond Fields Resources, then headed by Jean- Raymond Boulle, whose America Mineral Fields appears to be emerging as the victor in the mineral rush into Zaire. Boulle has forged close relations with the rebels of Laurent Kabila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time this contract was signed, links between Branch Energy's mining operations and the South African firm Executive Outcomes's holding company, Strategic Resources, became public, with press reports in London disclosing that Executive Outcomes held a 40% share in Branch Energy's Sierra Leone operation. Branch Energy has always denied that any corporate links exist between itself and Executive Outcomes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Branch Energy has been linked to Executive Outcomes in Angola and, most recently, in Papua New Guinea. In each case, the intervention has reportedly been by contact at governmental levels and aimed at wiping out rebel movements who occupy rich mining areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the two African cases, a mining concession for Branch Energy has followed. The Papua New Guinea operation failed. Executive Outcomes underrated the response to this operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Luanda-based diplomat, asked why there should be any concern about the linkages, said investors will be happy to know their stake is well-protected.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - For most South Africans, it seems as if winter has been with us forever, and yet it has still to arrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, since matters of climate and temperature are going to be even more on your mind in the weeks and months to come, I thought this would be a timely moment to point you to the weather forecasters of the Web. At the very least, you'll find someone to blame.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the best local weather services is Cape Town Weather Watch (http: &nbsp;//os2.iafrica.com/weather/index_ie.ht ml), an award-winning site carrying details on the most obscure weather-related information for interested parties ranging from aviators to sailors, swimmers to teachers. More general forecasts for Southern Africa as a whole ensure that it does not remain a parochial Capetonian site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Climate System Analysis Group (http://www.egs.uct.ac.za/csag/), the climatology group of the ENGEO department at the University of Cape Town, does not trade only in acronyms, but investigates &quot;climatological aspects of climate change&quot; through the use of Global Climate Models.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their weather satellite images are made available over the Internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African Weather Bureau World Wide Web server (http://cirrus.sawb.gov.  za/) provides forecasts for Southern Africa, but not nearly as well as certain foreign services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One such service is CNN Weather (http://www.cnn.com/WEATheR/), which carries four-day forecasts for 3 600 cities, as well as an Africa forecast map (http://www.cnn.com/WEATHER/Africa/forecast _map.html) and a &quot;select your city&quot; page (http://www.cnn.com/WEATHER/cities/world.ht ml) that includes Durban, Johannesburg, Pretoria, Soweto, Lusaka, Harare, Lilongwe and Maputo, but beware: the Johannesburg forecast for last Thursday and Friday, made last Tuesday, were as much as six degrees out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City.Net South Africa (http://city.net/countries/south_africa/), part of the international City.Net travel guide, provides concise weather summaries for major cities, which in South Africa's case means Pretoria, Cape Town, Johannesburg, Bloemfontein, Durban and Port Elizabeth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">weather.com's Africa page (http://www.weather.com/weather/int/regions &nbsp;/africa.html) attempts to do the same, but this is a more useful service American domestic travellers, with maps including even airport delays, but for South Africa offering only three-day forecasts for Johannesburg and Cape Town.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since its inception in October, four working groups have been created to tackle issues which have been identified as &quot;needing urgent attention in the media industry&quot;, says Sanef deputy chair and Sunday Times editor Brian Pottinger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanef comprises representatives from the now-disbanded, mostly white Conference of Editors, the Black Editors Forum and senior journalists from the electronic media, magazine world and journalism educators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sanef was established so that senior media practitioners and educators could speak with authority on matters of concern to the industry - training and corrective action, the promotion of media freedom and media diversity,&quot; says Pottinger.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The forum is currently running a series of government/media workshops in an effort to improve communication between the two parties. A neutral venue is chosen where government officials and journalists can, in a &quot;relaxed environment&quot;, discuss difficulties they experience with one another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Often journalists complain about the increasing bureaucracy in government departments with the insistence of officials and their representatives to have faxed questions sent to them. Reporters complain that this is time- consuming, while government departments argue that they do not trust the media enough to have telephone conversations where they can be quoted. All this is healthy when people start talking about it,&quot; says Pottinger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sanef executive has already raised pledges from a number of media organisations to help fund the establishment of a permanent secretariat to assist in administering the various programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four working groups established by Sanef are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The training committee where the government/media workshops are initiated.  Efforts are being made by this committee to establish a resource site on the Internet which will act as a noticeboard highlighting vacancies, scholarships and training programmes for journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rhodes University is setting up the Web site on behalf of Sanef.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This committee is also involved in training the trainers of journalism as many professors and educators of journalism have not operated in a newsroom themselves, says Pottinger. He adds that Sanef is keen to afford trainers the opportunity to work in a newsroom of a national newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the committee is involved in the long-term goal of establishing &quot; national standards of excellence&quot; for all journalists, a basic competency level for potential reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The corrective action committee which is establishing a database of employees in all media. Sanef has approached several media institutions, mainly print stables, in an effort to gauge the number of female and black employees. This, it says, will facilitate its study on whether the media industry is representative of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The third working group is concentrating on the promotion of media freedom and is drawing up a national charter to preserve freedom of speech.  Newly appointed Cape Argus editor Moegsien Williams is involved in this committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group will act as a watchdog, closely monitoring legislation which could possibly impinge on the editorial independence of newspapers and other media bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Newspaper Press Union and Sanef recently issued a joint statement outlining their support for a robust and independent free press and will establish a Free Press Forum - a permanent body aimed at bringing together all organisations who are committed to maintaining freedom of speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roadshows are planned for all nine provinces in a bid to educate the public on the importance of press freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The diversity committee is concentrating on development in the alternative media, including community-led ventures within the media industry - from community newspapers to community radio. Enterprise editor-in- chief and Sanef and Black Editors Forum chair Thami Mazwai is involved in this group</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 20-person Sanef Council of Editors will meet next month in Durban to discuss the progress of the committees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Despite denials and much dissension, a merger between two black media forums appears set to get the go-ahead, reports Jacquie Golding- Duffy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Black Editors Forum and the Forum of Black Journalists are planning to merge in a bid to preserve what they see as their common interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the plan is causing dissension in the ranks of both organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forum of Black Journalists chair Abbey Makoe denies a merger is in the offing: &quot;There is definitely no merger as far as I am aware and nothing has been discussed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, others have confirmed that meetings have been called to discuss the possible merger and some journalists are talking about the merger as if it is close to being sewn up.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certain journalists, who favour the idea of consummating a marriage between the two forums, say the move could only strengthen the position of black reporters and editors as they would speak in a unified voice to express grievances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some reporters from the Forum of Black Journalists are keen for the merger to take place, others are concerned that the Black Editors Forum may engulf the reporters' body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These reporters caution that colour is not enough to unite the two bodies, as the problems experienced by black editors are different to those experienced by black reporters; therefore separate groups are desirable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some members who have departed from the Forum of Black Journalists say they are disillusioned with the group, citing it as &quot;disorganised&quot; and &quot;wayward&quot;.  For these reporters, talk about an impending merger between the two organisations is neither here nor there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Forum of Black Journalists has to sort out its priorities before thinking about joining up with the Black Editors Forum,&quot; says one former member who refused to be named. &quot;It's a tight-knit group and either you're in or you're out. If you question some of the ideas of the Forum of Black Journalists, you are sometimes viewed with suspicion which is very unnerving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other members of the Forum of Black Journalists argue that a &quot;multitude of opinions&quot; are aired at its meetings and &quot;never is anyone intimidated not to speak&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Forum of Black Journalists &quot;is on track&quot; and committed to improving the situation of all black reporters as a pressure group as well as to acting as a platform for black reporters to vocalise their frustrations, says one member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is for this reason that some black journalists feel a merger will be advantageous - it will provide a platform for all blacks in the media profession where they will not feel the need to emulate their white colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some black editors argue that their commitment to the broad principles of the umbrella body - the South African National Editors Forum (Sanef) - should take precedence over the Black Editors Forum, but are concerned that black interests will not be preserved. A merger between the Black Editors Forum and the Forum for Black Journalists could, they say, maintain black goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, others argue that the Black Editors Forum will have to disband eventually, like the mainly white Conference of Editors, in a bid to assist Sanef in its efforts to present a united front of editors irrespective of colour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some black editors fear the dissolution of the Black Editors Forum will not bode well for the industry as the only avenue left for black editors will be Sanef.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black Editors Forum and Sanef chair Thami Mazwai has in the past defended the existence of the Black Editors Forum, saying its actions are not out of line with Sanef, although it does have a responsibility towards its black members to tackle issues which directly affect them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Black Editors Forum has led two delegations in the past, despite the formation of Sanef, and this has provided it with more leverage than the umbrella body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first delegation had afternoon tea with President Nelson Mandela in a bid to iron out differences between the president, government officials and editors. The second delegation met with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission regarding the Freedom of Expression Institute's involvement in the then-planned investigation into the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makoe says his understanding is that the Black Editors Forum would give Sanef &quot;one year's grace&quot; before evaluating its own status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanef deputy chair and Sunday Times editor Brian Pottinger argues that the forum is not at all opposed to certain groups pursuing special interests.  However, Sanef's commitment to presenting a united front is best demonstrated by editors joining the umbrella body, he says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Jacquie Golding-Duffy puts faces to the names of the applicants vying for the private television licence and gives a sneak preview of the IBA's final policy paper on private television</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INDEPENDENT producers will be displeased with the Independent Broadcasting Authority's (IBA) final private television discussion paper as it proposes that the new television channel, to be awarded at the end of the year, only has to provide 20% of local content programmes - a 10% drop from the original quota in the first document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It emerged this week that the IBA was compelled to decrease the quota from 30% to 20% as the SABC has admitted it is unable to meet its local content obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Owing to this, the IBA has instructed the SABC that it cannot have less than 25% local content on each of its three channels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While advertisers may be pleased with the drop in local programming on the new channel, independent producers, seeking more regulation and intervention, will be unhappy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insiders at the IBA have argued that it would have been inappropriate for the regulator to insist on a commercial channel fulfilling more of a local content quota than the SABC and its public service mandate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there is a need for a private television station that promises to serve viewers with a good mix of programmes, local and foreign, there are differences of opinion between advertisers and independent producers on what would rescue South Africa's beleaguered television industry. Independent producers want more local programming, while advertisers are vying for increased Audience Ratings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final policy paper also redresses the population percentage that should be catered for when the licence is awarded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Originally the IBA stated that the new channel would cater for 50% of the population when starting up. This would increase to 75% within three years and 85% of the population would be able to receive broadcasts within the licence's eight-year lifespan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the final document caters for 50% of the population when starting up, and 75% within three years and the rest of the licence's life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Available without decoders, subscription or licence fees to most South Africans with television sets, the new national television station will compete head-to- head with the SABC for viewers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fears are rife that the IBA's insistence on carving out quotas for local content and wanting to force the new channel to fulfil some of the public service mandate will stifle the commercial opportunities for the potential licence-holder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The private television document is based on the assumption - accepted by financial experts - that the new station will not only draw on existing revenue now going to SABC stations, but also on advertising revenue that will expand the television advertising cake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has been disputed by the SABC which wants to delay the licensing of a fourth channel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FACES BEHIND The APPLICANTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* MLULEKI GEORGE (49) is chairman of the Free-to-Air consortium and a non- remunerated director of the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George admits he has no television experience but says his expertise in business stands him in good stead. Currently an African National Congress whip in Parliament and senior vice-president of the South African Rugby Football Union, George was a personnel manager for an Anglo subsidiary in East London for 13 years until he took up his post in Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Free-to-Air is awarded the licence, George says it will be important for the consortium to maintain a balance between commercialisation and pleasing the person in the street. &quot;We aim to reach all viewers and cater for their needs, but at the same time we have to be deeply involved in commercialisation in order to raise funds. One of our main tasks will be geared at being financially self-sufficient so that we can be sure that the ordinary person's pocket is not affected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Free-to-Air, he says, is keen to explore regional television and &quot; specifically cater for the needs of people in outlying areas&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On what the SABC is doing wrong, George says it is not Free-to-Air's philosophy to criticise the SABC, but adds that there is a need for other television channels to be created.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The country is gradually moving towards free enterprise where strong competition will prevail. New competition can only benefit the public broadcaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot say the SABC is not doing its job as a public broadcaster because it has inherent limitations just like a private broadcaster has its own limitations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tight-lipped about its partners, George says the consortium is &quot;far too big&quot; to start mentioning names.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is, however, believed that several black-owned companies have been approached for further investment. Primedia (part owner of Radio Highveld and sole owner of Radio 702) has also been tipped as a possible partner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George is married with three children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* RAPITSE MONTSHO (43) is the CEO of Vula Television. He also owns and is MD of a production house called RM Productions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montsho says television is his life: &quot;It is all I know. Although I've been in television for more than 14 years it is not long enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experienced in all aspects of television from production to editing, Montsho worked for Worldwide Television News, one of the biggest foreign news agencies. He was also a cameraman for United States-based ABC News.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He then co-founded Video News Services, before breaking away and establishing RM Productions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RM Productions is one of the largest black- owned studios and has gathered some of the most exclusive &quot;struggle footage&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Registered in 1986, it is also one of the oldest black-owned companies.  Reluctant to divulge any information on what the consortium plans to offer the viewer, Montsho was only willing to say that it would &quot;offer exciting alternative television that will be viable and sustainable&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the SABC and its public service mandate, Montsho says he &quot;cannot condemn&quot; the SABC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think they have a tall order to have to provide public service broadcasting in an environment that is undergoing transformation. Often SABC staffers committed to change have to work with personnel that do not want to see change, which results in a lot of sabotage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montsho says if Vula Television is awarded the private television licence it will have to face the challenge of securing advertising from an industry which is controlled by mostly white middle-aged males. &quot;It is not going to be an easy road, but as we are committed to delivering maximum audiences, advertisers will be forced to respond to this by purchasing air time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montsho is married with no children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* VANESSA DU PLESSIS (44) is the company CEO of Community Television Network. She also owns her own public relations and marketing consultancy - Vanessa du Plessis Promotions - and has been involved in public relations and marketing for 22 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Du Plessis says she has been researching the South African viewership market for the past eight years and has concentrated on matching the needs of viewers with that of advertisers and marketeers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Du Plessis has been involved in niche television with her company CTN Direct TV - where she provides direct television channels for selected markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We provide footage tailored to the needs of several markets, among others, the stokvel market and tourism markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By providing entertaining, niche programming to selected markets, we ensure that viewers are watching the television that interests them while at the same time we are providing advertisers with an opportunity to penetrate this market of potential consumers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Community Television Network is awarded the licence, it promises &quot;good entertaining viewing which will inform without being boring, as well as providing a growth potential for marketeers through the medium of television&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the SABC, Du Plessis says the public broadcaster is confusing both the viewer and advertiser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She refused to reveal her local and international partners, but has previously been quoted as saying that the foreign investor will be involved in training locals, mainly people who were previously disadvantaged, in television production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is married with one child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* GLADWIN MARUMO (32) is the executive director and project manager of Station for the Nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His experience is diverse, ranging from advertising and printing to teaching in a classroom, being involved in film production and theatre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marumo worked in the advertising industry for just more than three years as a media buyer and later as a copy writer. The recipient of several awards, Marumo received the first Darryl Phillips scholarship award for advertising; the John Houk award for a short film Masemb'Enja! (Dogshit); and the Amstel award for a prize-winning stage production at the Grahamstown Festival called No Good Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has also lectured in the communications department at Pennslyvania State University in the United States and was involved in several television projects abroad. Marumo headed up the Independent Broadcasting Authority's radio unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If awarded the licence, Station for the Nation, he says, hopes to provide a &quot;comprehensive television service that will stimulate the growth of the independent production sector and meet the cultural needs of the diverse South African Community&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marumo was previously quoted as saying that black empowerment and human resource development are key elements to a successful bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Station for the Nation's partners include Thebe Investments's subsidiary, Moribo Investments; film and entertainment company Interlesiure; and Nine Network Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the SABC, Marumo says he would like to reserve judgment, adding that he does not think it healthy to criticise a rival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marumo is single.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* MATTHEWS (MK) MALUFANE (39) is chairman of Rainbow Television. Since 1986, Malufane has lobbied the government, international aid organisations and the broader community for support in broadcast deregulation and extending black empowerment to electronic media ownership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malufane has extensive television experience covering more than 10 years and has studied film production abroad. He was trained at several institutions including the University of California, Los Angeles, but had to return to South Africa for fear of losing his citizenship. Vying to become South Africa's first black television network owner, Malufane founded Broadcast Interest Group (Big), a lobby group aimed at empowering black people in the media, in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Rainbow Television's presentation to the Independent Broadcasting Authority which was compiled by Malufane, he says that the consortium supports the proposal for the first free-to-air private terrestrial service &quot; to be a national service with provincial obligations and not a regional station that may be networked&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malufane says that the consortium's national network, if awarded the licence, will &quot;effectively deliver local and regional access television for differing number of hours region to region&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their submission, Malufane argues that South African broadcasters and the general film and television production industries are not mature enough to produce a constant supply and quality product that can fulfil the local content quota. Instead, Malufane says the first three years of the new private TV licensee will be to successfully attempt to transfer the creative and management skills of Hollywood to South Africans in an effort to generate much- needed revenue to plough back into the local industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malufane is married with three children.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A drive to help local communities deal with their environmental needs, so that they do not become recipients of everyone else's problems, is contained in a White Paper to be presented to the Cabinet next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White Paper, which is likely to be made public later this month, comes at a time when tree-huggers and environmentalists are not the only people taking the environment seriously. The environment has become an everyday issue for many - so much so that there's a fast-growing market for sophisticated environmental home products going far beyond the simple water purifier of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among products developed in the United States is a high-tech home test-kit for lead, carbon-monoxide, UV radon and radioactive strontium-cessium. The latter is a critical measurement for those living in the Pacific North-West who are not entirely convinced of the all-clears given by their governments about the nuclear fall-out from Chernobyl in 1986.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another interactive product provides real- time information about a neighbourhood's environmental status. It is a monitoring system designed for informed decision- making that shows current and historic levels of pollution, hospital mortality statistics, and local disease clusters - all overlaid on a map of the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No wonder that big business in many parts of the world has placed environmental concerns high on the agenda. According to Nicky Robins, environmental manager for Nissan SA, business has recognised that &quot; environmental considerations are a strategic necessity in a global industrial market&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Africa, an Industrial Environmental Forum was established in 1990 by several key industries. The forum was relatively small to start with. But membership has flourished since its 1991 business and environment conference when more than 400 delegates discussed the impact of international standards such as the ISO 14001 and the development of the international environment system standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karin Ireton, manager of the forum, explains: &quot;Business has certain driving forces. You dance to the tune of the market that you are servicing. For example, if your market is in West Germany, which is an environmentally sensitive market place, you have to follow suit. The consumer calls the tune, if they want environmentally appropriate products, business has to listen to that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robins agrees: &quot;A shift has definitely taken place during the last five years. While it could be argued that companies have jumped on to the environmental bandwagon for marketing purposes, the reality of the situation is that any company exporting to industrialised markets and countries must improve its environmental performance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She argues that consumers in Europe and the US have two considerations, apart from price, when buying. First, they want to know how much &quot;blood&quot; is on a product; in other words, what safety standards are applied in making a product. And second, they demand to know the extent to which the product is being manufactured to the detriment of the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some critics argue that imposing such standards on the developing world is problematic, in the context of radical differences between developed and developing states and their respective market hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More ironically, almost all rich countries will overshoot their year 2000 greenhouse gas emission targets, agreed to at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1990, some by as much as 40%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African government has also climbed on to the international protocol circuit by signing three international conventions: the Montreal Protocol, which looks at ozone depleting substances; the Basel Convention, concerned with trans- boundary waste; and the International Convention, focusing on the climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental activist groups like GEM would argue that many of the standards South Africa has adopted are too low in terms of the real crisis facing the country. Studies reporting on the condition of the South African environment in the 1990s claim that where coal-burning power stations are situated, annual emissions of sulphur dioxide, the main ingredient of acid rain, total between 31 and 57 tons/km - a very high figure by international standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a paper on development and the environment, Peter Ngobese and Jacklyn Cock of Wits University argue that the South African case is a microcosm of the planet's environmental degradation. The combination of northern problems like acid rain and southern problems like soil erosion makes the country one of the most polluted areas in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, 400-million tons of top soil is being washed away in South Africa annually. A calculation of the replacement value estimates that at a cost of R30/ton of top soil, the value of the soil eroded only from the KwaZulu-Natal catchments each year is not less than R500-million and could easily be three or four times that figure. In the Eastern Cape, with far higher soil loss rates, the amount could run into many billions of rand annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the crisis, a holistic government approach to the issue has been a long time coming. Although a Green and White Paper process has been under way during the last three years, it does not help that the ministry responsible has changed hands and management so often.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An initial discussion document produced last year has led to the establishment of a Consultative National Environmental Policy Process. The White Paper on the environment which has been prepared is now heading for the Cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key concern of the White Paper is to ensure that local communities are informed and are involved in the major decisions affecting their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An integrated environment management approach will ensure that the national department sets the norms and standards and, in partnership with the provinces and local government, works out ways to monitor and lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lofty aims, but they are dependent on the capacity of the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism. With limited staff and skills to draw on, the department will be hard-pressed to monitor and evaluate many of the standards it sets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The real crux of the problem is that environment is low on the government's strategic priority list. As a result, the department has a small budget which needs to be stretched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robins argues: &quot;It is understandable that they need to rationalise and that they have low capacity and few human resources, but if they deprioritise the environment now, it will cost more in the long term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government must integrate its development strategies with its environment strategies, or the cost of fixing up what went wrong in the past will be too high to bear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, this is not necessarily the approach the government is taking: the growth, employment and redistribution strategy programme does not mention the environment as a consideration at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa shares this problem with many other countries. Most states send only their environmental ministers to sign the international protocols, without the big guns - the industry and treasury ministers - and this ensures that most promises are empty ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, business has set its own standards and evaluates itself. The Industrial Environmental Forum promotes the use of a holistic systems approach like the ISO 14001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concept, according to Ireton, is that a company sets standards based on environmental management systems developed to international benchmarks. The idea is that environmental management must be incorporated into a systematic framework that makes it an integral part of the whole business function.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second element of the ISO standards addresses the need to monitor and evaluate the systems put in place. They set criteria for ideal environmental monitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ireton explains: &quot;ISO at its best functions as it is designed - to be a voluntary system whereby businesses, to gain a clearance certificate, measure themselves against criteria that they themselves set&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Going the route of getting the ISO certificate can be expensive and therefore only relevant to companies where the business incentive is large enough. The problem with smaller firms is that there is less incentive to be environmentally friendly, and the state has very little capacity to monitor them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ireton points out: &quot;There is a role for government to play, but you should make it the responsibility of the people carrying out the business. If you create an atmosphere in which people only do things because an inspector is at the door, the attitude change that sees environmental issues as essential to their business practices will not occur. The government does not actually have the capacity to have so many inspectors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact remains, however, that it is the market and business that got the environment into trouble in the first place. The fossil-fuel industry is worth more than R7-trillion a year. Setting their own standards, according to international benchmarks, may satisfy a sensitive Western customer, but may be entirely irrelevant to the real South African and global environmental problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the debate to follow with the publication of the White Paper. It certainly is a policy vacuum which the government should be addressing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In a novel empowerment deal, an investment company will double your shares provided you meet a few criteria. Ferial Haffajee reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT'S an offer you can't refuse ... if you're a bona fide woman, and you can prove it by affidavit. Women Investment Portfolio Holdings (Wiphold) is offering to double the shares bought by women who take up its public share offer later this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A public share offer does not mean the company will list on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, but that it will make its shares available to the public with a view to listing in a year or two. A minimum investment will cost R2 000. This means most women will have to invest jointly.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a novel discount share option, all women who buy shares will receive an equal number of shares in the Wiphold Trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trust plans to ensure women's empowerment does not become just another buzzword. One way in which this will be done is through shares held in the trust having greater voting power than ordinary shares. The trust will also appoint Wiphold's directors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This provides a unique empowerment vehicle to ensure that women are catered for should Wiphold list. Then shares can land up in anybody's hands,&quot; says Mojela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wiphold has grown out of a smaller company, Women Investment Portfolio, which was started 18 months ago by four go-getters: Gloria Tomatoe Serobe (a Transnet executive director), Wendy Luhabe (a management consultant), Nomhle Gcabashe and Louisa Mojela (both former bankers).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We used to meet every Tuesday after work to plan our investments,&quot; says Mojela, who together with Gcabashe will work as Wiphold's executive director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four women, who all held other high- powered full-time jobs, went around the country prompting rural women involved in stokvels, savings associations, self-help schemes and community organisations to invest with them. They had meetings and lobbied hard, although sometimes regarded quizzically by rural mamas as &quot;these youngsters from Jo'burg&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their prodding paid off and soon women were lining up to invest; now they're lining up to buy shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyer Christine Qunta says: &quot;Women's investment companies have a different feel, they're more down-to-earth. Women have been saving successfully through the worst repression in stokvels and burial societies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These companies can bring about a radical change in the economy, especially if women continue to be self-reliant and raise their own money.  You don't have to rush off to a merchant bank to raise money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's what Wiphold is planning to do with its share offer, though Mojela is a little cagey about the company's existing investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she says they give preference to blue- chip companies. They already own shares in the clothing chain-store Smart Centre, an investment trust called Baobab, a rural financing company called Kind Finance Services and Radio Highveld. Wiphold has also put in a bid to buy government-owned Sun Air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company will invest in those sectors of the economy where women have the greatest oomph, be that consumer clout or in sectors where women workers constitute a majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumer goods and media companies will be among Wiphold's first selection.  It has already been Sun International's partner in a range of bids for casino licences across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But perhaps the most innovative area to watch Wiphold move into is agriculture. Mojela says it is a logical step as most farmworkers are women and agriculture is gaining a healthy slice of the export cake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Women can, for example, buy a winery farm in Cape Town. Then we can offer a share incentive scheme so workers feel they are part of the company. You know that the more you work, the more dividends will come through,&quot; says Mojela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women's investment company has struck a chord around the country with provincial businesswomen getting together to invest in Wiphold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Eastern Cape, a group of 50 professional women led by Dr Nomsa Mazwai has been yoked together under the banner of the Ladies Investment Group, which will take up shares in Wiphold. Another such group exists in the Western Cape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mazwai's task is to ensure the company has an impact on more than just the industrial heartland of Gauteng.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wiphold is taking root in rural areas, but there is a message which the company's directors will be taking on the roadshows planned once the public share offer is made. &quot;We would like to plough back profits into the company.  That needs to be made clear to stockholders; you put in your money and forget about it for two to three years,&quot; says Mojela.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In an unfavourable macro-economic environment, Gear could confound plans to provide the necessary support for agriculture, writes Asghar Adelzadeh of the NIEP in the sixth of a series on economic policy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been several attempts to specify and quantify the contribution of agriculture to South Africa's broader economy. Most concur that the sector's direct contribution to gross domestic product, employment and exports has declined significantly in the post-World War II period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agriculture, however, plays a larger indirect role in the economy through linkages with other sectors. Studies have shown that increases in agricultural production have large positive impacts on growth, employment and the balance of payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For every R1-million of expenditure on agricultural production, the overall economic output increases by R6,4-million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agriculture also has a strong multiplier effect on employment. More jobs are created in agriculture with increased production than for any other sector of the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, studies show that in the face of an unfavourable macro-economic environment, domestic policies which are aimed at encouraging agriculture to play a role in job creation and redistribution may flounder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This argument is not unique to South Africa. In a variety of countries, domestic farming policies have been unable to compensate for macro-economic policies which are unfavourable to agricultural production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Africa, the World Bank has argued for a land reform programme that concentrates on investments in the former bantustans and the redistribution of land, through market mechanisms, both of which should lead to the creation of a class of &quot;emerging farmers&quot;. The process of &quot;downsizing&quot; farm size, according to the World Bank, will lead to a more dynamic rural economy and to greater employment and income creation among low-income groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Macro-economic Research Group/International Labour Organisation policy proposals, on the other hand, place a very different emphasis on the potential of agriculture for job creation and growth. They single out investment in agro-industry and social infrastructure as the key macro- economic strategies for growth and job creation in rural South Africa. They argue that a policy which targets agro-industry creates new jobs, improves rural livelihoods, and has the potential of stimulating the economy as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How does agriculture fare under the growth, employment and redistribution (Gear) strategy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* One of Gear's central objectives is to transform the economy to an export- driven economy. A major policy initiative to enable this involves removing a series of &quot;constraints&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While domestic agricultural policies do not feature as one of the &quot; constraints&quot; hampering the economy, the implications of the policy for agriculture are clear. An accelerated approach to reductions in tariffs, subsidies, quotas and exchange controls will certainly have serious implications for a sector that historically was well-protected and was focused on local markets and national self-sufficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Gear ignores the possible role of commercial agriculture in South Africa despite its prominent, albeit indirect, role in the economy. It fails to recognise the potential this sector has for economic growth and job creation, particularly in rural areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gear also ignores the features of the manufacturing-agricultural complex - its labour-intensity and the potential for dynamic linkages with other sectors of the economy - which made it an obvious target for investment in the African National Congress's pre-election economic thinking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Gear's broad emphasis on export- orientation is, coincidentally, in line with the sub-sectors of agriculture that have the greatest potential for employment creation and growth. Exports of high value foods - vegetables, citrus, grapes and deciduous fruit - are expanding much more rapidly than field crops like maize, wheat and oil seeds, the traditional strength of the agricultural economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Horticultural farmers also employ more labour at higher wage rates than field crops and animal products, the other two main agricultural sub-sectors.  Any expectation that South African horticultural exports will experience the same kind of rapid growth rates experienced in Chile, Brazil and Taiwan must, however, consider the global environment that permitted these countries to expand their export industries so rapidly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International competition may also limit the extent to which South African agricultural exports can expand. Exporters are already competing with countries which all have the same counter-season advantage as South African growers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The potential for growth in high-value food exports and, by implication, employment growth, foreign exchange earnings and dynamic linkages with other sectors of the economy depends on international market conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International conditions may not permit the rapid expansion of exports as was the case for countries like Chile during the 1970s and early 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The employment and growth potential associated with high-value food exports must also be weighed against the costs of a free-trade oriented economy to farmers and farm workers producing field crops like maize, wheat and oil seeds for the domestic market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While exporters will emerge as winners in an open economy, the agricultural losers will be maize, wheat and oil seed farmers. Competing with maize and wheat imported from the United States or the European Union will be extremely difficult for South African farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* There is an enormous political will in South Africa for small-scale black commercial farming. Land reform, the construction and maintenance of rural infrastructure and assistance to &quot;emerging&quot; farmers are the strategies which appear to be directed towards improving the livelihoods of the rural poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small &quot;emerging&quot; farmers represent the cornerstone of land reform and rural poverty alleviation. Whether small-scale farmers will be able to grow to deliver on these high expectations in a neoliberal and open macro-economy is very much in doubt. How will &quot;emerging&quot; farmers fare under Gear and what impact will it have on rural poverty?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Gear's assistance to small-scale black farmers will be temporary and they will not be protected from market forces through the subsidies and protection that white commercial farmers enjoyed for so long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once emerging farmers have received an initial grant, assistance will take the form of &quot;streamlined extension&quot; and in the development of marketing strategies. This shift is in line with a policy that prepares new farmers for an open economy and a public investment programme that is constrained by strict Budget deficit targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The similarities between Gear and a structural-adjustment programme also means that the international experience of small farmers under structural adjustment must be instructive. Most case studies suggest that, in the absence of direct state intervention, small-scale farmers are less likely to succeed in a &quot;free-market&quot; environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the more common results of structural adjustment is the concentration of production and land in fewer hands. Under a neoliberal economic environment, for instance, the experience of maize farmers in Mexico, threatened by highly subsidised maize from the US and Canada under the North America Free Trade Agreement, indicates that the ability to respond effectively to international competition depends on the scale of the operation and on direct state assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While large farmers with access to credit and marketing institutions were able to diversify and modernise production, small farmers found themselves without institutional support in a market-driven economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For small-scale farmers state assistance was vital, but in a neoliberal macro- economy, they were left largely destitute of institutional support, precisely at a time when they need full access to these services to modernise maize production and diversify cropping patterns towards higher value crops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Finally, Gear's emphasis on small-scale farming must be measured against its potential for alleviating and eradicating rural poverty. There are two issues which suggest that emerging farmers cannot be the only solution to rural poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first is that rural land reform programme that is aimed at increasing the efficiency of &quot;emerging&quot; farmers is unlikely to reach the poorest households and is much more likely to assist farmers who are already earning part of their income from farming. The second issue is that even if a small- farmer scheme were successful in targeting the rural poor, it is doubtful that enough farmers could be targeted to have a meaningful impact on rural poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current estimates suggest that there are about 11-million poor people in the rural areas. A land-reform scheme that is successful in creating 50 000 additional new small-scale farmers would, however, not have a major impact on the millions of rural households who have depended on wage incomes in order to survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small-scale farming, as the lynch-pin to land reform, thus faces two overwhelming challenges: first, it is not likely to benefit from a neoliberal macro-economic environment; and, second, those farmers who are successful will not be numerous enough to have a significant impact on rural poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Gear is silent on the role of commercial agriculture, its emphasis on export promotion is in line with those sectors of agriculture that are already expanding rapidly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The success of rural poverty alleviation for wage-workers in this sector depends on improving conditions through equity schemes and union organisation.  Unfortunately, both of these are in a sense voluntary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gear's emphasis on smallholders is highly problematic, given the equal or greater emphasis it places on fiscal austerity and an open economy. Local and international evidence suggests that smallholders do not fare well in a neoliberal environment and that when they do, it is through state support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article is based on a paper commissioned by the Land and Agricultural Policy Centre from the National Institute for Economic Policy and written by Dr Charles Mather of Wits University's Geography Department</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The half-day strike organised for Monday by the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) appears set to go ahead, despite talks planned for Saturday aimed at suturing controversy around the draft Basic Conditions of Employment Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government and labour are optimistic of a settlement at the talks, but business is still at odds with the Bill. Business would like to see concessions on the Bill's call for issues such as a shorter working week, overtime pay, longer notice periods and three days family-responsibility leave.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the executive director of the National Economic Development and Labour Committee (Nedlac), Jayendra Naidoo, said good progress had been made in negotiations this week. &quot;The main issues on the table have been covered,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negotiators were tight-lipped about the details of gains won at previous talks. But Cosatu was upbeat, while the government was said to be mooting amendments to the Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An already fraught week was intensified by business's decision to apply for a court order declaring Cosatu's planned strike unlawful. However, Cosatu appeared to have complied with the Labour Relations Act (LRA) and notified Nedlac within the time limits of its protest plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Business South Africa (BSA), its court action was less about whether Cosatu had got the technical requirements of the Act right, and more about whether the union was sticking to the spirit of the Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BSA complained that negotiations on the Bill had not yet reached a deadlock and that it had only been a fortnight since it was tabled. &quot;We are not trying to be vexatious, but the Act seeks to enshrine conflict resolution,&quot; says BSA's Adrian du Plessis. &quot;Problems have to be settled around a table, not on the streets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And although this week's negotiations at Nedlac were said to be cordial and mature, labour was angry at business's action. &quot;BSA has not moved an inch (in negotiations),&quot; said Cosatu's assistant general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi. He added that business had objected to socio-economic strikes since the negotiations around the LRA began and said court action was a way of continuing its protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether there had been a legal wrangle or not, there appears to have been no turning back from the strike action by Cosatu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday's protest is a shadow of the first campaign outlined by Cosatu, which aimed for a full-day strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plans are already in place: buses have been hired, posters put up and pamphlets printed and delivered. In Mpumalanga, union officials have been taken off normal union work to devote themselves to organising the strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosatu's regional office in Cape Town complained of some intimidation by employers, but marches starting at midday have been organised around the country in all major centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of Cosatu's regional offices said they would be able to cancel Monday's action, if negotiators settled the dispute this week, by using community radio stations and the SABC. Vavi, however, said: &quot;It's not possible to call off a strike in a day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A resourceful organiser in Cape Town had a solution: &quot;We may even turn it into a victory celebration.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - De Beers has lost another lucrative source of African diamonds. This time to a new contender linked to mercenary group Executive Outcomes. Chris Gordon reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BRANCH Energy Angola, the company linked to South African mercenary operation Executive Outcomes, has received a new mining concession from the Angolan government, making it one of Angola's most significant - and valuable - mining operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concession - coming after a few months of strained relations with the Angolan government last year - threatens to knock yet another jewel out of the De Beers's diamond crown. Angola is one of the world's top producers of high-quality gems, with diamond sales worth an estimated $1-billion a year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Branch Energy Angola is a subsidiary of DiamondWorks Angola, in turn a subsidiary of a Canadian company listed on the Vancouver Stock Exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By November, Branch Energy's operation in Angola had reached a low point.  The company had to decide whether to expand or pull out, only months after their concession was formally agreed by the Angolan government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrest of 21 of Branch Energy's operatives in their Luarica concession, before access had been granted last September, was followed by reputed difficulties with the government over the formation of DiamondWorks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Branch Energy's response was to offer the government an upgraded operation, using the capital from the DiamondWorks flotation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company put in additional strategic infrastructure, and reorganised its management. It bought an IIuyshin 76 and installed a powerful telecommunications system in Luanda linked to the Johannesburg telephone exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saurimo, in the diamond-rich Lunda Norte province, will become a customs post so mining equipment can be flown in direct from South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The objective, according to Branch Energy, is to provide logistical support for companies wanting to invest in Angola, as well as supporting Branch Energy's own expanded operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This strategic approach extends to mining, which the company describes as &quot; security- led&quot;. Teleservices, the Executive Outcomes- owned Angolan security firm, is sent in first to secure the mining areas, before mining operations commence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Branch Energy's own diamond security in Luo is headed by JC Erasmus. Like many of Branch Energy's South African staff, he is a former member of apartheid South Africa's notorious Civil Co-operation Bureau death squad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erasmus is also a shareholder in DiamondWorks. Asked about Branch Energy's relations with Executive Outcomes, he described them as &quot;good friends&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The diamonds from Luo are valued at $400/carat by DiamondWorks, with diamonds from the Luarica concession valued at $600/carat. They expect to produce 10 000 carats a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Branch Energy's latest acquisition is the vast Alta Kwanza concession - 18 000km2 region in Bie Province, Unita's heartland. Bie Province is thought to have been mined by the Angolan opposition group since the early 1980s.  Relations with Unita are said to be amicable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luo is Branch Energy's first operational diamond mine, although their earliest diamond mining concession was the 1995 contract for the Koidu kimberlite pipe in Sierra Leone. The contract was awarded over the heads of Sunshine Mining and Diamond Fields Resources, then headed by Jean- Raymond Boulle, whose America Mineral Fields appears to be emerging as the victor in the mineral rush into Zaire. Boulle has forged close relations with the rebels of Laurent Kabila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time this contract was signed, links between Branch Energy's mining operations and the South African firm Executive Outcomes's holding company, Strategic Resources, became public, with press reports in London disclosing that Executive Outcomes held a 40% share in Branch Energy's Sierra Leone operation. Branch Energy has always denied that any corporate links exist between itself and Executive Outcomes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Branch Energy has been linked to Executive Outcomes in Angola and, most recently, in Papua New Guinea. In each case, the intervention has reportedly been by contact at governmental levels and aimed at wiping out rebel movements who occupy rich mining areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the two African cases, a mining concession for Branch Energy has followed. The Papua New Guinea operation failed. Executive Outcomes underrated the response to this operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Luanda-based diplomat, asked why there should be any concern about the linkages, said investors will be happy to know their stake is well-protected.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - When an Eastern Cape farmer saw some small fish in his streams, he thought they were trout spawning, and called in local scientists to make sure. They discovered the little creature was, in fact, the Cape galaxias, which had never before been recorded in Eastern Cape river systems.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also known as Galaxias zebratus, this striped fish, not much longer than an adult's finger, was originally described from the Cape Flats by the French Count Castelnau in 1861. Since then it has been recorded in a number of coastal rivers, from the Keurbooms to the Olifants River system in the Cape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although it has many relatives in the southern hemisphere, it is the only species in Africa. The Galaxiidae are secretive fishes, which quickly dart under rocks if threatened,and can exist in large numbers undetected. Galaxias zebratus went undetected in both the Krom and Gamtoos river systems until recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The long, slender bodies of young fish make them easy to distinguish from other small fish such as minnows. The larger mature fish are more difficult to observe and stay on the bottom, under rocks or in vegetation. Their bodies are transparent, with red gills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the males are ready to breed, you can see their milt through the body walls. Likewise, the relatively large eggs can be seen in the females.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This unusual little fish has been in Africa for possibly 100-million years and is part of the unique biodiversity of South Africa. Alien fish species could eliminate remaining populations within a year. It is time to seriously consider how to conserve them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Trout may be the favourite fish of South African anglers, but they are dangerous interlopers who wreak havoc on our ecosystems, argues Jim Cambray</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BETWEEN 1850 and 1950, there was a dramatic increase in the rate of animal extinctions, which coincided with European colonial expansion. Many alien plants and creatures were introduced to colonised territories, some with disastrous consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of these was the rainbow trout, which is still being moved, in many cases illegally, around South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and other countries. It is still being introduced into river systems where local species have been living and evolving for many thousands of years. In the light of present-day knowledge, this is truly eco-terrorism.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Good environmental impact studies must be carried out before any plant or animal species is introduced. The ardent trout angler may say &quot;trout are an important resource&quot; or simply that &quot;a person likes to eat trout&quot;. But one misguided person with a breeding pair of fish can cause irreparable harm to endemic species.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are enough case histories in the world to warn us. Take, for example, the introduction of Nile perch into Lake Victoria: it is now estimated to have resulted in the extinction of more than 250 fish species.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Olifants River in the Western Cape, alien trout and bass were introduced to &quot;improve&quot; the fishing. The result has been catastrophic and this river now has a high number of endemic freshwater species in the Red Data Book, the log of species close to extinction. This is indeed nothing to be proud of. It was also completely unnecessary, as there was already one of the best South African angling species, the Clanwilliam yellowfish, in the river system, a fish that grows larger than trout or bass. It was clearly lack of good impact studies and introducing what one already knows. This is a recipe for disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, a small fish resembling trout was found in the Eastern Cape's Krom River - the Cape galaxias. The Cape galaxias is an interesting, indigenous freshwater species, with relatives in Australia, New Zealand, South America and on many islands. It is possible that they have been living at the southern tip of Africa since the break-up of Gondawanaland, millions of years ago. They are now threatened by the introduction of alien predatory fish like trout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, in New Zealand, alien trout have possibly caused the extinction of several near-relatives of our Cape galaxias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what is the myth of trout in this arid country of ours? Is it the assault on the mind by all those cigarette and alcohol advertisements with a trout neatly laid out on the damp grass, reel and trout flies artistically arranged near the dead or dying fish? Surely informed and educated people can understand that introducing alien species, whether it is trout or black wattle, may cause species extinctions and environmental impacts on entire aquatic ecosystems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa has signed an international convention on biological diversity and we need to follow through on those principles. The original introductions of alien species were once thought to be beneficial. But today we should and must know better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moving fish around the country is an offence. It is illegal to move fish without permits because these introductions can result in irreparable harm to the biodiversity of aquatic ecosystems. If you are found guilty of introducing fish without permits in some parts of Australia, the fine is $50 000, as well as eradication charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would strongly recommend that South African environmental policy-makers also implement heavy fines for offenders. We have just passed through a period of political terrorism: let us now move away from eco-terrorism, even if it means the end of trout.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In the kind of civil war which South Africa's liberation struggle represented, what constitutes a human rights violation?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Testimony to the truth commission has ranged from evidence from newspaper editors concerning their publications' degree of complicity with apartheid oppression, to submissions from criminals and torturers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, any action which infringes upon another person's freedom and well-being or aids such an infringement, might be held to constitute a human rights violation. Normally, though, in a war, combatants are not generally considered uniformly guilty of human rights crimes. This is especially the case when armies confine themselves to fighting each other, and in which - on each side - violence is directed against people who, themselves, are armed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in guerrilla wars, matters are not quite so straightforward. In such conflicts, professional armies are arrayed against amateur soldiers in irregular formations whose survival often depends on the degree to which they integrate themselves with a supportive civilian population. In such circumstances it often becomes very difficult to make distinctions between insurgent soldiers and non- combatant civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, battles and skirmishes often take place on the terrain chosen by the guerrillas, in the midst of their communities rather than in areas from which civilians have been evacuated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conversely, from the point of view of the guerrillas, their prospects of victory scarcely ever depend upon outright military superiority. Rather, they employ violence in such a way that it demoralises their foes and undercuts the legitimacy of the regime: successful guerrilla campaigns often seek to disorganise society and demonstrate to the regime's supporters the authorities' incapability to guarantee security and protection. If guerrillas dispense with such tactics then they have to confine their warfare to the arenas favoured by military professionals, arenas in which they can only be losers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly there are rules of war, though most armies seldom conform to them rigorously. Normally it is losers who get penalised for breaking them. Such rules attempt to protect civilians and prisoners from military violence, as well as regulating the kinds of weaponry which can be used to kill and wound soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After World War II, German and Japanese generals were punished for executing captured soldiers and massacring civilians. But not all kinds of massacres were considered to be war crimes: &quot;carpet&quot; bombing of German and Japanese towns with the deliberate intention of killing thousands of civilians was not held to constitute a war crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the South African case, the African National Congress endorsed principles in the Geneva Convention which were written to govern the behaviour of irregular armies in guerrilla wars. It breached those principles on several occasions when it attacked targets which had no military significance and in which the intention must have been to hurt and terrorise civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To be fair, it undertook such actions relatively infrequently and not all of the terrorism undertaken by its cadres was sanctioned by Umkhonto weSizwe's senior command. ANC representatives argue that their breaches of human rights can be distinguished from the government's in two ways: there were fewer of them and they were committed in the course of a struggle which had noble ends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such arguments may seem reasonable enough, but a more intellectually convincing response to accusations of human rights violations directed against guerrilla forces would be that guerrilla struggles would be futile if they did not hurt civilians in one way or another. In any case, all wars breach human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the human rights crimes of which the South African security forces are often accused today may also be explained, if not defended, on the grounds that such actions are inevitable and even necessary in the business of fighting a war. That doesn't exonerate policemen or soldiers who plot the murder of civilian political activists, or who sadistically mistreat captives and detainees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the violence committed by security forces was probably counter- productive in terms of their own objectives of maintaining order and suppressing rebellion: for example, the harsh methods of riot control used by the former South African Police probably prolonged and extended civil insurrections. Political murders often removed identifiable leaders, making the task of locating subversive organisation more difficult. Very little of the torture inflicted by the police yielded information they did not already have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, some of the violence and violations for which senior commanders are today expected to seek amnesty were consequences of actions which had quite reasonable military objectives. Cross- border raids were sometimes directed at targets which accommodated guerrilla commanders, or at least which defence force generals believed to be inhabited by Umkhonto or Azanian People's Liberation Army officers. Guerrillas in front-line territories often lived in communities which included civilians: this was a consequence of the kind of war they were fighting. Inevitably non-combatants were killed - though sometimes such killing was undertaken with brutal gratuitousness by South African soldiers and policemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth commission is not a moral tribunal, but rather an institution which is intended to establish the extent of the casualties of South Africa's liberation, to make arrangements for restitution where this is possible, and to protect former adversaries from the normal legal penalties which otherwise they might be exposed to. Inevitably, though, people on all sides will make moral judgements about the evidence presented to the commission. In making such judgements there may be a good case to separate acts of war from violations of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some recent debates about the moral culpability of individuals and parties, this distinction seems to be lost.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - South Africa should get to grips with how Africans are coming up with solutions to the challenges of life, writes Stephen Ellis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHITE South Africa spent 40 years doing its best to keep the rest of the continent at arm's length, but reality finally intruded. Since 1994, South Africa has not only become a democracy, but has joined the Organisation of African Unity and ceased to be the outcast it once was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So do South Africans like what they find in the rest of Africa, now that they have made friends with it at last? Many South Africans, and not just whites, give a fair impression of thinking that big problems start at the Limpopo: Aids, civil wars, massive corruption and all the rest. Above all, immigrants come from north of the Limpopo. There are plenty of tired clich's about the breakdown of formal government in most of Africa, but, unfortunately, many of them are not just figments of the imagination.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Important things are happening throughout the continent - not all of them bad, by any means. South Africans have to live with these developments, whether they like it or not. The first post-apartheid government could certainly do with a more thoughtful African policy, particularly if it is going to give some substance to Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's remarks about an African renaissance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this is not just a problem which can be left to the government. It concerns every South African, since whatever happens north of the border will make itself felt south of it too. Thinking about the rest of Africa makes South Africans nervous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let us take Zaire, since it happens to be in the news. That country has about 45- million people, of whom 23-million are economically active. Only 400000 of them have formal jobs in the private sector. There are about 420000 civil servants, but since nobody pays them most of the time, they can hardly be said to have real jobs. The armed forces are somewhere between 65000 and 80000 people, but no one pays them most of the time either. They don't get paid because Zaire doesn't really have a government at all, at least not in the way we would normally understand it. Nor do quite a few other African countries, some of them closer to South Africa's borders than Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, are Zaireans all pathetic, starving beggars? Not at all. Zaireans trade, trade, trade, and more than you might imagine they actually thrive on it.  Operators on major markets in Zaire are in daily contact, via satellite- telephone, with traders on the massive Zairean market in Brussels. This is the nerve centre for trade with the Zairean communities in Moscow, Hong Kong and Abu Dhabi. There are markets in Kinshasa and Kisangani which, although unofficial, are fully globalised. Marketeers know the latest Antwerp price for diamonds and the exchange rate of dollars, and charge accordingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since formal government has more or less disappeared, people have found other means of getting along together most of the time - which is what governments are really supposed to be for. The leading local businessmen often get together with other local dignitaries - a couple of bishops, perhaps a chief - and together raise the money to pay the local army commander. He can then pay his soldiers, which stops them looting. They may even get to defend the local community against bandits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the official government stopped working years ago, there is an unofficial government which does work better than you might expect. This state of affairs is not going to change if Laurent Kabila becomes president of Zaire, since there isn't a functioning civil service to inherit, and he won't be able to set one up from scratch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So one of the biggest problems posed by a country like Zaire is knowing who to talk to about business or diplomacy. If the official government isn't worthy of the name, and can't control events outside the capital, or even inside the capital city, then there's not much point in signing a diplomatic accord or a contract with it. But Zaire is too big to ignore, and there are major business deals to be done there, so a way has to be found to make durable agreements and deals. This is where South Africans need to think hard about how to deal with a place like Zaire. In any case, some typical Zairean solutions to the problems of life also occur in South Africa. But official South Africa sees them as a problem or a threat, most of the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the way things are being done in Africa, increasingly. There is little serious evidence that the continent is on the verge of solving what the World Bank calls its problems of governance with a few more structural adjustment programmes here and a couple of trained accountants there. The problem goes much deeper than that. Africa, the colonised continent, is at last getting to grips with its deepest historical traditions. Perhaps South Africans need to think about this if they are to feel at ease in the new Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Madikizela-Mandela has not delivered as leader of the ANC Women's League in the past, and herrhetoric may presage the death of the organisation, writes Rhoda Kadalie</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The re-election of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela as president of the African National Congress Women's League is more a reflection of the weakness of the organisation than it is a victory for the women's movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The persona of Madikizela-Mandela loomed large in the conference arena two weeks ago, rather than a strategic plan of action for women's empowerment, as exemplified by her election speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She used her self-inflicted poverty to identify with the people of South Africa. She threatened to shut up the press should they continue to vilify her, she declared that the salvation of the people lies in her hands, as only she can lead them to the promised land.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madikizela-Mandela has not been able to deliver as leader of the league over the past five years, so what makes her think that she can do so now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is such rhetoric not the death knell of an organisation made ineffectual and weak by constant allegations of financial mismanagement, a cut-throat leadership battle and no clear programme of action?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Can it be disputed that the election was a personal victory for Madikizela- Mandela, whose main base has been the league, in a context of increasing isolation of her own political party?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it can also be argued that the state of disorganisation in the league has inadvertently created the space for an array of women's organisations to emerge and for a range of women's voices to be heard as exemplified by the series of submissions made at recent parliamentary hearings on the Lund committee's recommendations on child maintenance grants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critical alliances are being forged around a number of key post-apartheid issues like abortion, state maintenance grants, domestic and sexual violence, women's human rights among others, while the league languishes in the narcissistic political machinations of its leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Party in-fighting has paralysed the organisation to such an extent that Lilian Ngoyi, Josie Palmer, Katie Louw, Dora Tamana, Helen Joseph and Frances Baard would fail to recognise the organisation, were they alive today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The irony is that it is women in the ANC leadership who are in conflict with each other, so that there is nothing to instil any confidence that loyalties to women's interests will take primacy over party- political loyalties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the context of human and constitutional rights, the league has not been very vocal around the Beijing Platform of Action, the monitoring of the implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (Cedaw), nor the under-funding of the Commission for Gender Equality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the parliamentary hearings on the Termination of Pregnancy Bill and the state maintenance grants for women and children, the organisations which were most vociferous were the Reproductive Rights Alliance, the Abortion Reform Action Group, Rape Crisis, Ilitha LaBantu, the Gender Advocacy Project, the Women's Human Rights Documentation Centre, the New Women's Movements, the Human Rights Commission and the Commission for Gender Equality, to name but a few. And not the women's league.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly the league is no longer the dominant conduit for women's voices.  Its inertia has alerted women to seek bases elsewhere and not to be dependent on an organisation which has lost its vision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no better time than now for the league to get its act together, or to disband, given the proliferation of national institutions committed to the empowerment of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is the Office of the Status of Women, which has been charged with monitoring the gender desks in each government department; the ad-hoc Committee on Improving the Quality of Life and Status of Women was formed to monitor government's commitment to Cedaw; the parliamentary Women's Group is a multi-party women's caucus which frequently convenes around urgent issues of concern to women and the recently constituted Commission on Gender Equity which has been appointed to monitor, investigate, advise and lobby around issues related to the advancement of gender equity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rallying around women's issues is not necessarily a unifying activity as exemplified by the schism within the women's leadership in the ANC. Who determines the needs of women? Of which women? As defined by whom? And how should they be prioritised? The notion of &quot;woman&quot;, particularly in the South African context, cannot be taken for granted. Who speaks on behalf of whom?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These issues currently determine the political landscape of women's politics in South Africa, and while the women's league continues to play political games, the need for urgency has propelled certain organisations into action in order to address the crucial concerns of poor women in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The league should guard against becoming as moribund and ineffectual as most post- independence women's party-political organisations have become elsewhere in Africa, Latin America and Eastern Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its future is dependent on a radical restructuring in terms of its leadership, aims and objectives and programme of action. It needs to woo younger membership and to diversify its base in terms of region, ethnicity and class by recapturing its old strongholds in its former constituencies in Guguletu, Woodstock, Wynberg and Bonteheuwel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If this is not done as a matter of urgency, the women's league is doomed to perpetuate itself as a remnant of its former self, existing only in name, with no power, basking in the reflected glory of its illustrious past.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - A struggle is looming for custody of a report documenting widespread human rights abuses by Zimbabwean security forces in the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details of the report - handed to President Robert Mugabe in March - were carried in the Mail &amp; Guardian last week. It reveals a bloody campaign of terror unleashed by the army's North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade in Matabeleland against counter-insurgents loyal to Mugabe's long-time rival, Joshua Nkomo, now vice-president.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Zimbabwe's Catholic bishops are battling to keep a lid on the gruesome findings of their own Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace, the report's co- authors, the Legal Resources Foundation, an independent advisory service, want it published without further delay. In particular they want to publicise the report's recommendations for a reconciliation trust to channel aid to the troubled region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the bishops have the report, ironically entitled Breaking the Silence, under lock and key and are refusing to release it before Mugabe has commented.  Foundation officials privately suggest this strategy is designed to sweep the whole matter under the carpet, given the intimate relations that now exist between the president and the Catholic hierarchy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkomo is equally anxious to suppress the report. His position depends upon a 1987 pact with Mugabe which allows his followers a share of state power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Catholic commission insiders say Nkomo recently stormed into their offices demanding that all copies of the report be handed over to him. He warned staff that publication could jeopardise the nation's unity. They refused to comply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed reconciliation trust, Uxolelwano in Ndebele, representing the government, the Catholic commission, the foundation and affected communities, would seek funding for projects such as scholarships, clinics and counselling services. Modelled on a similar scheme set up in Cape Town for the KTC squatter camp which had suffered state-sponsored communal violence, its advocates hope to source US$68-million in government and donor support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foundation insiders said this week that if the bishops persist with their refusal to release the report, the foundation may publish it themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two organisations put out a joint statement on Tuesday regretting publication in the media of extracts from the report which omitted any mention of the trust proposal. The Catholic commission denies any rift with the foundation. There had been differences of approach between the authors, one church source conceded, but they now had &quot;a common view&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission legal officer Liz Feltoe is hopeful the bishops will get a reply from Mugabe next week. &quot;The bishops are confident they will get a response,&quot; she says. Others are less optimistic. Mugabe has in the past proved obdurate, refusing to apologise for what happened in Matabeleland or to offer compensation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has other worries, including allegations of sleaze in state tender awards and the threat of being eclipsed by South Africa in the Zaire talks. &quot; He will try and ride out the storm,&quot; said a foundation official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The need for transparency is underlined in the report itself which describes the killings at the notorious Bhalagwe camp as comparable with the genocide carried out by the Nazis and Cambodian tyrant Pol Pot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Welshman Ncube, of the University of Zimbabwe's law faculty, said the recommendation for a reconciliation trust was central. &quot;To heal the wounds victims need to be acknowledged, requiring a mechanism whereby survivors and victims' families can receive state assistance.&quot; Referring to those perpetrators of violence who today occupy key posts in the government, armed forces and police, Ncube said: &quot;Mass murderers should not be entrusted with responsibility . especially when tasked with protecting human rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the SAS Outeniqua - The score or so of journalists who had been quartered on the fo'castle of the SAS Outeniqua for three days - exotically studded in among the winches and anchor cables and miles of rope - were feeling distinctly out of sorts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A one-day trip to mark the conclusion of a peace treaty between cancer- ridden Mobutu Sese Seko and rebel Laurent-Desire Kabila was already stretching into its third day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We had learnt why eating places on ships are called messes. All 22 of us, slept two nights on an open deck, with only a roof about the size of a carport between us and the sky.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday, the first day of waiting. Well not really the first. Foreign Affairs and the offices of the president and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki had already been dealing with the peculiarly Zairean way of doing things for months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Nelson Mandela arrives on board ship, around two or three in the afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clean Americans, led by United States ambassador to the United Nations and butt- kicker at large, Bill Richardson, have also arrived. Organisation of African Unity and UN special representative Mohamed Sahnoun is also there.  We all set sail for our rather romantic assignation on the high seas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila has refused to meet Mobutu in face- to-face talks in either Zaire or any of its neighbouring states. For his part, Mobutu has a doctor's letter saying he cannot travel further than X kilometres away from specified medical treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently Catch-22 again. But Mbeki comes to the rescue: hold the talks at sea. On a South African naval vessel. In international waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All that is missing now is Mobutu. Earlier in the day he had arrived in his private jet at Pointe Noire airport. Now we were waiting for the helicopter to bring him on board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And waiting. And waiting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventually a contingent pulls up at the gangplank - actually a flight of about 30 moveable stairs. They count studiously. They shake their heads. The Lion of Africa will not be able to climb 30 stairs. And so the clean Americans leave the ship to arrange helicopter transport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They return looking glum. Mobutu will not be flying in a helicopter. He's quite willing to go ahead with the talks of course ... it's just the helicopter thing, you understand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heads are put together. Richardson and the clean Americans go down the gangplank again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News gradually filters through of what the alternatives are. Mobutu can be winched up from the dockside. Or he can meet the ship by motor boat and be pulled up from the sea in a special metal cage, usually used, one presumes, for bags of mielie meal and the like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next time the clean Americans return they are beginning to look just a teeny bit rumpled. Uh uh. Mobutu has presumably seen in his mind's eye the front page picture in the world's newspapers the next day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is more head-scratching. Finally, a solution is found. The ailing president will be driven in to the ship's hold. And, voila, plan D proves acceptable. And Mobutu finally arrives in the early evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a great heaving of ropes and cables and a song in our hearts we are finally on the high seas as darkness falls. The light of the Cabinda oil rigs shine like fairy lights to starboard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, they are shining to port as the news comes through. Kabila can't make it. Mbeki, who has gone off to fetch him in Luanda, has come back empty- handed. We dock and Mobutu's cavalcade sweeps off again. And it's back to the drawing board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next day there are very long silences from the other side of the ship, broken only by infrequent &quot;briefings&quot; from hapless Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, although we don't know it, things are happening. The US ambassador to Angola has visited President Eduardo Dos Santos in Luanda, with whom Kabila is staying, with an unequivocal message that the US would be defending Kinshasa should the rebels choose to attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contact is finally made. But no go. Kabila won't come on board unless the Americans are off. Exit the no longer so clean Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by this stage another Catch-22 is taking shape. Mobutu refuses to board again until Kabila is already on the ship. Kabila, of course won't board except in international waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is Mandela who finally breaks the deadlock by satellite phone in satellite phone diplomacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Get your butt down here by nine o'clock tomorrow or I'm going home, he says, or something to that effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That same afternoon, Kabila's advance guard of security people flies in.  And the recalcitrant rebel leader's own helicopter is not far behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the next day, Mobutu's not inconsiderable pride assuaged, he rejoins the boat in a somewhat less ostentatious cavalcade. And the games can begin ..  .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And end just over an hour later. It's all over, bar the preparation of a joint communique that says just about nothing. It amounts to a restatement of two old and completely incompatible sets of demands, though it is spiced up with a few commendations on the willingness of the two principals to compromise and behave in a proper and statesmanlike manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agreement had in fact been reached during the brief negotiation. Mobutu had agreed to step down and hand over immediately to a transitional authority which would than see Zaire to democratic elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So there you have it. Except that the very next day Kabila announced his soldiers would be taking Kinshasa by force. And the media reported the rebels were getting closer and closer to the Zairean capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So there you have it. Well, not quite. Despite their relentless advances, the rebels didn't seem to be getting any closer to Kinshasa. And on Tuesday Kabila reassured Mbeki that a ceasefire was in place after all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Mobutu has flown off to Gabon for conferences. His aides are saying he might have to proceed to France for medical treatment before returning home to Kinshasa -though he is not fleeing, you understand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the next round of South African- brokered talks are pencilled in for some time next week. So there you have it. Or maybe not? Who knows.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANNE WATSON is not exactly the image of a typical street whore. With her comfortable walking shoes, baggy grey tracksuit and light-weight anorak, this middle-aged mother of two (with matching middle-aged spread) has caused a few of Rosebank's curb crawlers to double-take as they cruise the area in search of sex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every night at about 8pm Watson strides purposefully from her luxury home in Houghton, Johannesburg, to pound the surrounding residential streets with some very low-class prostitutes and transvestites.</SPAN></P>

Yet the 49-year-old redhead continues her seemingly suicidal one-woman campaign to purge her suburb of prostitutes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You may think it's a crazy thing to do and my family would wholeheartedly agree, but I could not just sit back and watch this area degenerate into a red-light district without doing something,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It certainly seems like an exercise in madness for a wealthy white woman to be out on the streets after dark in the crime capital of the world. Watson is first to agree there are risks involved. But then she is a martial arts expert able to fell an assailant with a single blow, and a former prison governor to boot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe she's a risk junkie and misses the action. &quot;Not at all!&quot; she insists.  Her's is the softly-softly approach, using gentle persuasion and polite conversation. &quot;I simply inform the ladies that I intend to stand with them all night and they know the presence of a white woman will scare off customers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially Watson would approach a hooker and ask if she was lost. &quot;No,&quot; replied the prostitute ,&quot;I'm waiting for a taxi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, then I'll wait with you,&quot; Watson would volunteer earnestly. &quot;It's very dangerous to be out so late, but we'll be safer with my dog.&quot; The woman would eventually have to abandon her position in the face of this unwavering and unwanted companionship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the prostitutes cottoned on to her game plan and moved to another block along Oxford Road, Watson followed - accompanied by her trusty companion, a formidable- looking Rottweiler called Samantha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a cat-and-mouse game involving the women hiding in bushes, Samantha being sent in to ferret them out and Watson calling the police on her cellphone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I couldn't do this without Sam putting the fear of God into the women,&quot; she explains. But I begin to doubt Sam's ferocity as she eagerly licks my hand, though I'm informed that she is just well-trained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those clients not deterred by the mere sight of Watson and her dog are treated with the same direct approach. &quot;I go up to them and ask if they are lost. Then I inform them I have taken down their licence number and will forward it to the police.&quot; On hearing this, most men roar off with the alacrity of Nigel Mansell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some are less easily distracted from their quest. She recalls the night some weeks ago when she approached an elderly white man sitting in a parked beaten-up old yellow bakkie on a road frequented by the prostitutes.  Introducing herself, Watson pointed out it was the third time that week she had clocked him picking up hookers. &quot;It's cheaper than having a wife,&quot; snapped the man undaunted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He may have a point,&quot; agrees Watson with a wry smile, &quot;but I would rather such activities not take place in my area.&quot; So it is a case of moving the problem into someone else's backyard. &quot;I know that, but it's for other people to follow my lead and keep moving these women on,&quot; she retorts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watson, a Canadian criminologist who once ran Hong Kong's women's prisons, moved into the neighbourhood (which is also home to President Nelson Mandela and Gauteng Premier Tokyo Sexwale) four years ago with her Australian husband, Bob Watson, and their children, Sarah (18) and James (17).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their six-bedroomed house is just a stone's throw from Rosebank's bustling shopping complex and several expensive hotels frequented by businessmen and wealthy tourists. The area has long attracted prostitutes, but a couple of years ago there was sudden influx of cut-price Soweto girls, openly plying their trade on the streets and using empty office parking lots as alfresco hotel rooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Strange cars began cruising around and parked up and down the roads,&quot; says Watson. One night she stood and counted 45 vehicles kerb-crawling within an hour. &quot;When I took the dog for a walk, I would find the roads and hedges littered with used condoms and soiled toilet paper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the scantily dressed prostitutes would shout obscenities at passing motorists and lift their skirts to expose knickerless bodies to passers-by. &quot;They also attracted criminals,&quot; she says. &quot;Whole bunches of guys used to stand on the street corners - either pimps or robbers, waiting to pounce on the women to take their earnings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watson's beat incorporates a six-block stretch along Oxford Road, from 11th to Glenhove. &quot;Heck, it gives me something to do in the evenings and it's better than staying at home with a book.&quot; Beneath the self-deprecating quip lies a strong sense of civic duty and a take-charge approach to life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watson grew up on a horse ranch in a small farming community near Montreal, Canada, where the tradition of helping others came as easily as sitting on a saddle. Her father was active in local affairs and her mother delivered meals on wheels to the elderly. &quot;We certainly had plenty of barn- raising for neighbours after bad storms,&quot; she recalls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She virtually crackles with energy (she refuses to have a domestic, as it would be anathema to her farming upbringing) and a zest for life, which shine though in her easy banter with her children. Humour and good manners appear to be her antidotes to violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was very hectic for a while because the women were protecting their territory, but I tell them it's not personal and now some are quite friendly towards me, even though I'm damaging their business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She has sympathy with the prostitutes, having heard the stories of their life on the game. &quot;It's the men I despise. The girls would not be there if the clients were not there.&quot; She is urging the police to find a way of publicising the number plates of regulars as a deterrent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watson complains that South Africans are too complacent about crime and accept it as something they must live with. &quot;People tell me the women have been there for 10 to 15 years and there's nothing anyone can do. They say I'm crazy to get involved, and security guards in the area (whom she claims are in cahoots with the prostitutes) say that because I'm not South African I don't know the rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But imagine if everyone in Houghton (or anywhere else for that matter) decided to take their dog for a walk every now and then - even for an hour.  They would reclaim their neighbourhood and drive out the criminals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her tactic seems to be working. The women (all black) used to have a clientele comprising about 90% white men driving expensive cars - most wanted quick blow jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But after a month or so, when they saw me taking down their numbers, the proportions changed to 50% poor whites in bakkies and beat-up cars, and the rest were blacks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These days the streets are often devoid of prostitutes because the women say it is not worth the hassle. Many of them have moved up the road to Dunkeld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Watson has even managed to persuade the two local police stations (Rosebank and Norwood) to work together in support of her clean-up drive. Norwood picked up a record 112 prostitutes in April, due largely to Watson's vigilance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while senior officers applaud her bravery, they appear keen to put an end to her outings. &quot;She renders a service, for which we are grateful,&quot; says Inspector Schalk, at the Norwood community police forum, of which she is a member. &quot;But my personal opinion is that it's very dangerous for a lady out at night, even with a dog.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sundays used to be the busiest night. &quot;I've seen everyone, from a Muslim cleric in full regalia to randy teenage boys, cruising the streets. When I come out and there are no prostitutes hanging around, I feel I'm doing my job ... But I know If I slack off or go on holiday, they will come back.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durban - Kwazulu-Natal has been forced to re-employ 230 senior teachers, including 60 principals, who had been given hefty retrenchment packages under the state teacher redeployment programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The province said this week the teachers have been re-employed at their previous salaries, many until the end of the year, because there were no immediate replacements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move conflicts with the national Education Department's aim to balance state education resources between provinces by redeployment of staff or opening up teaching positions through voluntary severance packages.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the policy which has been running since last year, thousands of teachers across South Africa have taken the voluntary severance packages.  Many have been senior, experienced staff whose pay- offs, complete with pension, run into seven-figure sums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Education Minister Sibusiso Bengu said earlier this year the government was reviewing the policy, given the unexpected cost of the packages. National officials were unavailable for comment this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Layman, chairman of KwaZulu-Natal's education redeployment agency, said 514 principals, 223 deputy principals, 925 heads of department and 1 465 senior teachers had taken the voluntary severance package. The total pay-off bill, before pensions, is estimated at R150-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the provincial department had approved the retention of personnel where no immediate replacements were available: the 60 principals had no deputies to succeed them, Layman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move was described by politicians and unionists this week as a &quot;stop- gap&quot; measure following the &quot;utterly disastrous&quot; effects of the voluntary severance programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We felt the packages should only have been granted in those cases where they facilitated redeployment from historically advantaged to disadvantaged schools,&quot; said Kate Skinner, representative for the South African Democratic Teachers' Union (Sadtu).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only those who couldn't be redeployed were supposed to be offered packages, and school principals and specialists maths and science teachers should have been refused packages.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadtu negotiator Don Pasquiallie said Wednesday's wage talks walkout by teachers' unions could also be attributed to the failure of the packages scheme, as most posts it left vacant were not abolished. This had reduced savings intended to augment wage increases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic Party's KwaZulu-Natal education spokesman, MP Roger Burrows, said he understood schools faced with the loss of key personnel could argue to retain them if their posts could not be filled immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The wider problem it highlights is the loss of our best educators under the scheme. I think many more schools have motivated to retain personnel who have been granted that right by the department.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A small Free State town provides a testing ground for South Africa's three-year democracy. Stuart Hess and Dawn Blalock report</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ELIZABETH MOROENYANE, a mother of six, sits on a blanket in the dirt plot she can now call her own. She traces a small square in the dust with her fingertip, fills it with an X, and describes the day three years ago that she queued for 10 hours to vote for the first time in her life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She makes a thumbprint next to the square: &quot;Mandela,&quot; she says. She is proud to have &quot;done a wonderful thing to choose Mandela and bring him to power&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regardless of class or colour, lives have changed dramatically, for better and for worse, in this farming community in the northern Free State. Some residents are philosophical, others still hopeful - and others still angry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viljoenskroon is probably as typical a small town as anywhere in South Africa. If changes brought by democracy can happen and succeed here, they can happen anywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three years on, the town still has distinct divisions between black and white. There is a &quot;white&quot; town and, across the R59 highway, a &quot;black&quot; town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rammulotsi, the sprawling township with 102 000 residents outside the main town, is growing rapidly every year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 7 000 white residents in the town are more empathetic to their fellow black residents. Emily Ramile, a social worker in Rammulotsi, says : &quot;They have come to understand that this country is changing and they must go along with the change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moroenyane is pleased with the material changes in her life since 1994. She no longer walks 12km to fetch water, but points to a tap in her yard. Her shack has electricity. Nurses regularly come to treat residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She says black residents now have the right to walk through the town whenever they please. In the past, they had to heed a 9pm curfew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She says she paid R10 a month and now owns the land on which her corrugated- iron shack stands. But a shack is still a shack. By now, she expected her family of 12 would have had a real house. She believes violence and crime are worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children are sexually abused by men who are home all day as a result of worsening unemployment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some turn to crime because jail, with free food and warm clothes, beats starving and freezing in the squatter camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We see some fruits of the changing - the old authority and the new authority are joined together to be one,&quot; says pensioner Nathaniel Seobi (79).  After all, this former church leader explains, a three- year-old child doesn't learn to walk, run and talk immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other Viljoenskroon residents are not as satisfied with the new South Africa. &quot;Mandela gets paid lots of money but we, we've got f-all.&quot; says an angry Abram de Jager (27). &quot;Parliamentarians only look out for themselves, but here in the squatter camp, we work very hard but we get nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Jager supports a family which includes uncles, cousins and aunts on the R200 a month he earns as a farm labourer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He paid in blood for democracy - two of his brothers were killed in the struggle against apartheid. De Jager is angered to see those he fought still benefiting while he has few options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those who killed my brothers are still working in nice offices,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President still has a debt to pay, he warns. &quot;Mandela must remember ...  a lot of people spilt blood for him. He would not be where he is now if we didn't do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the government is preoccupied with the ghosts of apartheid activists. &quot;They dig up bodies of old fighters, but what about us? We have problems here and they don't help us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three years ago a farmer, Louis Botha, was the acting chairman of the Viljoenskroon branch of the National Party. He saw change coming and prepared for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was in favour of a new dispensation and I worked for it, so in a sense I got what I worked for,&quot; Botha says. &quot;There's no room in this country for the type of democracy that allows whites to rule themselves as a separate entity.  I accept the fact that I'm in an African country - I don't mind being ruled by a government that is democratically elected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, Botha says, unemployment has increased since 1994 and union policies are contributing to the problem: &quot;Farmers are afraid and are holding back (on hiring) right now ... because of concerns about the unions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Botha says he saw it coming, crime has hit hard. And it hits across the board. The Viljoenskroon police force seems paralysed to fight it.  Botha suspects the police were involved in the theft of some of his cattle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week Botha's son, a computer scientist, is emigrating to California's Silicon Valley. Botha is happy for him, and confident that one day he'll return and that South Africa will be worth returning to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it is not normal at the moment,&quot; he says, &quot;we are heading for a normal life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohau Moirapedi (20) has recently had his efforts thwarted by vestiges of the apartheid mindset. It's not white youths but their parents, he says, who are making it difficult for him and others to start a sports club for youths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Too young to vote in 1994, he supported the ANC although he's not a member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moirapedi wants to be an office administrator. He is very satisfied with the secondary education he received. &quot;Now even in the black school we've got a white principal and white teachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was thinking a black president would get us out of the oppression my parents lived under. The new government must try to work harder to see how many they can help to be in tertiary education. If not, some are going to be thieves or join organisations that make our country corrupt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He'd like to continue his education but he can't afford it. &quot;The problem is financial. I was thinking that money is not the real problem and now I see that it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bryden Leather sits drinking beer at the Birds Bar at the Hotel Mahem in the white town with his AK-47 on his knee - one of 107 guns he owns and collects on his 4 300- hectare farm. When not farming, he organises private hunting trips for Americans around Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former Koevoet soldier who saw action in Namibia (which he still calls South West Africa) and an ex-policeman, he calls a former police buddy on his private cell number when he needs the police. No one answers the phone on the regular line, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What has improved in his life in the past three years? &quot;Crime,&quot; he says, without making clear exactly what he means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the shit they expected to happen before the elections - it's all happening now,&quot; he says. &quot;Crime has doubled - and he (Mandela) can do nothing about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leather says farmers have been left out in the cold by government policies over the past three years, fuel prices have skyrocketed, the Maize Board was demolished leaving farmers to market their harvests with their own rand, and that rand is worth considerably less than three years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blacks &quot;have been promised everything&quot; and the goods have not been delivered. They have to resort to crime to survive, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've got nothing against the black person,&quot; adds Leather, even though he often uses less than flattering (unprintable,actually) words to describe blacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I cannot exist in my farming operation without him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ask Viljoenskroon people what has changed the most in their lives over the past three years since the election. The resounding answer, regardless of colour or class, is the same: crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the town's mayor, Pule Mokitlane, believes residents are exaggerating the crime problem, although his house was recently deliberately burnt to the ground. He now lives in the &quot;white&quot; town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Serious crime is not that bad. There has been an increase in house- breaking, but our police force is handling that very well,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's the sage-like Nathanian Seobi who sums up Viljoenskroon's adjustment to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone is free to live, not free to make violence, to be a thief,&quot; he says. &quot;Freedom is to know each other and respect each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Despite criticism, Cuban doctors work in places where South African doctors refuse to go, reports Dawn Blalock</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The child on his mother's lap is breathing in short quick breaths. The mother describes his symptoms in Setswana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How many days with the fever?&quot; the doctor asks in English. Although neither English nor Setswana is his native language, he recognises key words.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After examining the drooping child, he turns to his assistant: &quot;Order an ambulance.&quot; The mother, although she doesn't speak English, visibly tenses at the word &quot;ambulance&quot;. Tears stream down her face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mama, don't worry,&quot; says Dr Nilmido Sosa Diaz, patting her hand. &quot;Tell her it is better for her and her baby to go to the hospital. Tell her it may not be tuberculosis. And it's not going to cost anything,&quot; he says to his assistant and translator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diaz (32) is the first doctor at the Nelson Mandela Clinic in Bekkersdal on the West Rand since it opened three years ago. He has been there for eight months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He sets a relentless pace, seeing a patient every 10 minutes from 8.30am until 4pm, emptying the unlit hallway lined on both sides with sick people from the squatter camp across the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His cases are typical maladies of squatter camp existence: tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases, high blood pressure, and accidents such as the woman who had paraffin thrown into her eye during a fight. Going there this week the clinic resembled a school as it teemed with small children coming for vaccinations in a &quot;beat polio&quot; campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patients usually leave with a packet of free medicine, a detailed explanation and often a generous handful of condoms with Diaz's encouragement to use them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diaz is one of nearly 300 Cuban doctors working in South Africa under Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma's programme to shore up inadequate health resources. The programme has come under fire amid allegations that the doctors lack both skills and language - even the Interim Medical and Dental Council, formerly a staunch ally, has recommended it be put on hold for a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diaz, however, has little time for the controversy. He divides his weekdays between two clinics in Bekkersdal. On alternate weekends he works in the emergency room at Leratong Hospital in Kagiso. In whatever is left of the afternoons he ventures into the community to visit patients at their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He doesn't mind the 40-patient-a-day workload. &quot;I came here for work,&quot; he says, leaving his wife, also a doctor, and as yet unseen four-month old daughter in Cuba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He earns about R7 000 a month, with 30% earmarked for his government. The Health Department says his salary compares with a South African doctor with the same experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most Cubans don't think about work in terms of money,&quot; he says. &quot;I won't leave my country. I cannot change life by money,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuma's representative, Vincent Hlongwane, says the programme has been a &quot; resounding success&quot;. He brushes off the medical council's concerns. &quot;We need more doctors from Cuba and from other countries,&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But those at the receiving end of the criticisms feel bruised and baffled.  Cuban doctors, they note, are deployed all over the world: South Africa is one of 43 recipients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are out there working where South African doctors refuse to go,&quot; says Elio Savon, political counsellor at the Cuban Embassy. &quot;In other countries the gratitude is much more than the criticism. But in South Africa it is the opposite.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back at the clinic, Diaz's assistant barges into his consulting room. The ambulance is here but the mother and child cannot be found. Someone saw them disappearing into the squatter camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That really hurts me,&quot; Diaz says. In Cuba, he would have arranged for the child to be treated at home. He knows he'll never find her in the camp. Now he is trying to make home treatment the practice in Bekkersdal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he says with a shrug, &quot;I'm only one.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - One week after staging a mock wedding ceremony with Cape Town's most notorious gangsters, the city's Olympic Bid Company is quietly muttering about irreconcilable differences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two sides signed their Olympic Peace Initiative late last week, in a carefully managed show - complete with priest - designed to persuade the International Olympic Committee that gangsterism should not stand in the way of Cape Town's bid for the 2004 games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Away from international eyes, however, two areas of conflict have already emerged, with company officials privately conceding that the gangsters gained most from the marriage.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bid officials took to the stage under protest. Chief executive Chris Ball said the show was not the company's idea - it came instead from the powerful Olympics community forum. The company has also scorned the gangsters' claims that the initiative has ended all their activities in the Western Cape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My friend, it is clear to me that there are no longer any gang activities in the Western Cape and that is all due to this agreement,&quot; says Pastor Albern Martins, a self-appointed &quot;missionary&quot; to the gangsters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the bid's media director, Paul Johnson, says it is obvious that the statement cannot be true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bid company's decision to endorse the initiative followed much hand- wringing. The determining argument seems to have been that the city's escalating crime problem could be a key barrier to a successful bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ball, nevertheless, balked at the prospect of joining Rashied Staggie, the leader of the Hard Livings gang, and Martins, on stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group which Martins represents, the Community Outreach Forum, draws most of its membership from The Firm, an umbrella organisation for gangs whose main activity is regulating supplies of mandrax, heroin and dagga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such activities, police say, continue unabated, although Martins has committed his members to helping the police should the games be staged in the Mother City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ball this week refused to comment publicly about such misgivings, instead terming the show a &quot;brave&quot; initiative. &quot;It is not our task to restructure the social fabric of the community, but if the bid can be used as a catalyst to achieve something constructive, then it is to be encouraged,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaliegah Zardad, the bid's director of community relations, added that she believed it time &quot;to give these people a chance&quot;. Other bid officials, speaking privately, are concerned that the initiative has merely helped the gangsters' search for respectability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martins and Staggie, both now claiming to be reformed, have already announced their plans to contest the 1999 general election through a newly formed party for coloured people, Die Suid-Afrikan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think maybe the Olympic people made a mistake in signing this agreement,&quot; said police spokesman John Sterrenberg.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The fight between Pagad and gangster groups has political ramifications for the Western Cape, reports Stefaans BrUmmer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PAST links between political parties and the antagonists in the Western Cape's escalating violence between vigilantes and gangsters have come back to haunt government and security agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, a year after People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad) first took to the streets to counter gang rule on the Cape Flats, the Western Cape violent crimes unit head, Leonard Knipe, warned of a descent into near-war - and said police were struggling to curtail the violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Knipe: &quot;This is almost a civil conflict ... it's almost as if armies are on the loose out there attacking the houses of so-called gangsters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knipe said police had logged 23 acts of &quot;naked terrorism&quot; - mostly houses shot at or bombed - by alleged Pagad elements in the first three months of this year alone. During the same period 96 cases of gang- related crime were recorded.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spiral of violence has forced tough choices on politicians. Justice Minister and African National Congress Western Cape leader Dullah Omar, for one, is in the unenviable position of having to deal with Pagad supporters as an important part of his Western Cape constituency. But his justice portfolio binds him to a politically neutral approach when the law is contravened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Pagad and the anti-Pagad Community Outreach Forum (Core), an umbrella organisation of Western Cape gangs who claim to have &quot;reformed&quot; and to be working towards peace, have appealed to political sentiment to advance their aims. Pagad, which in principle unites communities across the board in service of its cause, is historically a predominantly Muslim organisation, and members have tried to enlist government members like Omar in the service of their cause on the basis of a shared religious background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Omar and the ANC did not give Pagad the sympathy it thought it deserved, Pagad started flirting openly late last year with the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC). The alliance was an easy one to form: the PAC's former military wing, Apla, had operational links with the Islamic fundamentalist body Qibla during the armed struggle against apartheid. Qibla has strong relations with Pagad, among them the fact that the two bodies share a number of their top leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of the escalation in attacks on alleged gang leaders' homes, it is not clear to what extent Pagad officially supports using the military option.  Pagad has in recent months formed its &quot;paramilitary wing&quot;, also called the G- Force, into small cell structures at neighbourhood level, which have the capacity to operate undetected and independently from central organisational control. Some cell members are said to be veterans of armed Islamic campaigns in hotspots like Bosnia, Lebanon and Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Jeremy Vearey, the commander of police intelligence co-ordination in the Western Cape: &quot;Pagad seems not to be in any position to control the actions of its members. There is very little centralised control ... and the energy unleashed by the Pagad cause could reproduce itself in a pattern of militancy with a life of its own independent of direct structural ties to Pagad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, the threat of more violence must be counted as an important bargaining chip in Pagad's attempts to extract concessions from government and security authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Core has made a similar play of political expediency. Rashied Staggie, leader of the influential Hard Livings gang and now a leading light in Core, appears to believe the ANC owes the gangs a debt for support given during the liberation struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former ANC soldier confirmed that there had been a degree of co-operation between gangs and Umkhonto weSizwe members. Guerillas often had no choice but to use safe houses and safe routes supplied by gangs. But he insisted the co- operation was no more than &quot;operational expediency&quot; and that no promises were made to the gangsters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that before the 1994 elections, ANC intelligence operatives again had no choice but to &quot;interact&quot; with gang leaders to ensure ANC election campaigners had safe access to gang territory. He claimed that at the time there had been active collusion between apartheid security forces and gangsters to harass ANC activists, which the ANC had to counteract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That charge is not far-fetched. The Goldstone commission and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission have heard accounts of security forces in other regions enlisting gangs in attempts to smash activist networks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the ANC in government can clearly not afford to associate with gangsters, there are reports that, in a few individual cases, links have remained. An unsubstantiated claim has been made to the Mail &amp; Guardian that a senior ANC politician, who appears to have long- standing links with the Staggie family, was involved in a recent arms consignment to a Core member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Formed last year in reaction to Pagad marches and attacks, Core has made a play for the government to crack down on Pagad and simultaneously help gangsters transform their &quot;business interests&quot; - traditionally based on the drug trade, prostitution and protection rackets - into legitimate areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are precedents for this: in Malaysia and Burma, authorities are said to have helped drug lords channel their illicit profits into legal businesses, expecting them to walk the straight-and-narrow afterwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is some sympathy for a similar approach among police and intelligence bodies in the Western Cape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One police intelligence officer this week hinted that &quot;agents of influence&quot; may have been used to help establish Core; the rationale being that a more visible and unified gangster body would be easier to control. Another said there was a similar strategy to &quot;bureaucratise&quot; Pagad. When leaders are tied into official processes, and given the capacity to control their followers, violence can be curtailed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Core, and even more so the gangs who are not part of it, will be difficult to transform. Gangsterism on the Cape Flats represents a decades- old social alternative which, in some neighbourhoods, young men especially find extremely hard to escape. Gang crime, a multi-billion rand industry, provides a livelihood for thousands of people. Said Vearey: &quot;The factors that generate gangsterism cannot be addressed by the appearance of gang leaders on a stage and a confession.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether Core is genuine about reforming gangs, or whether it is just a superficial response to the pressures brought to bear by Pagad, it holds its own aces for concessions from the authorities. Staggie appeared recently to flex his muscles on the &quot;debt&quot; the ANC owes him when some Core leaders let it be known they would support Bantu Holomisa's new party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has also been talk of Core going it alone as a political movement.  Especially in the Western Cape, where the coloured community is first prize in the votes struggle between the ANC and the National Party, the gangs have tremendous potential to secure for themselves - or to deliver - constituencies. Gangs arguably have better organisational networks on the Cape Flats and in towns across the Western Cape than either party, and have shown themselves adept at &quot;winning hearts and minds&quot; by providing livelihoods where government is still struggling to fulfil its promise of a &quot;better life for all&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the politicians it is a tough call: give in to the demands of the gangsters or Pagad - but not both simultaneously, as they are so implacably opposed to each other - or face their wrath and alienate a potential constituency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alternatively, make no concessions and concentrate on neutral policing to put the worst offenders behind bars. But both forces are so deeply rooted in society, and their passions so pervasive, that a few offenders behind bars will hardly stop the crime.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The government plans to release psychiatric patients from state hospitals into the community, writes Stuart Hess</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government is planning to shunt thousands of mental patients out of state-run institutions and into the care of their families and friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Health Department said this week its fledgling, community-care programme involved closing hospitals and wards, and moving out many of the 10 000 to 15 000 mental patients currently under the state's care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A two-year pilot project in the Eastern Cape and Kwa-Zulu Natal is already under way, with patients treated at the new clinics that form the central plank of the government's primary health-care drive. The scheme will be rolled out across South Africa should the pilot prove successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initiative follows a similar drive in the United Kingdom and the United States, where savage cutbacks in state-provided mental care left tens of thousands of former patients on the streets or in prison.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department's director for mental health and substance abuse, Mervyn Freeman, said this week that the British and American programmes &quot;weren't run properly&quot;. However, the South African pilot programme would be overseen by experts from both countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pilot programme would also throw up potential cost savings - the current budget for state-funded mental institutions stands at more than R756- million - although Freeman said cost-cutting was not the priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Until we are sure of exactly how many can be moved it is difficult to determine how many beds are needed,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The department is in favour of moving people into community-care facilities wherever possible. Many people prefer the option of returning patients to the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new clinic network would be called on to offer psychiatric care, and the government was also looking at establishing &quot;halfway houses&quot; and daycare centres for newly released patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chronic patients would remain in state care, in institutions controlled for the past 20 years by the Life Care Company - now part-owned by the listed black empowerment group, Real Africa Investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freeman said the programme formed part of a national plan to improve conditions at mental institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng's Sterkfontein and Weskoppies have both been restructured, he said, while Westfort - roundly condemned in an official investigation last year - is to be closed. Other institutions remain below standard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But serious concerns remain about the new clinics' ability to provide normal healthcare to their communities - many don't even have staff - let alone specialised treatment for mental health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overseas experience, where care-in-the- community policies have been associated with the worst excesses of Reaganism and Thatcherism, have also left independent experts anxious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must learn from the US and UK experience and not rush into this programme,&quot; said Lage Vitus, national director of the South African Federation for Mental Health. It co-ordinates various mental health NGOs in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme had several pitfalls, he said, not least the need for adequate training of clinic staff and education for families and communities.&quot; The bulk of the work falls to members of the community, people who act as friends to support mentally disabled members of the community,&quot; said Vitus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freeman said much of this education would involve teaching families how to &quot; deal with patients and to make sure they take their medication&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that a major obstacle was actually tracking down the families. &quot;In some cases they are simply dumped at the institution and their families totally disown them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rhona Chetty, a social worker at the Aryan Benevolent Home in Durban, said more emphasis was needed on care in the community, particularly as institutional care was so expensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the state should also look at patients' functional ability before admitting them to mental homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't need high-tech electronic security at the homes,&quot; she said. &quot;It could be a place where people care for themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;Tara: The five-star experience</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a hilltop overlooking Johannesburg's northern suburbs, Tara - the H Moross psychiatric centre - looks like a five-star hotel with well-groomed gardens and lawns, a nine-hole golf course, two tennis courts and a swimming pool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behind the glitzy appearance is a hospital providing intensive treatment of mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, depression and anxiety disorders. It also deals with eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The environment provides a haven for those in psychological distress,&quot; says the 141- bed hospital's brochure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tara is presently at 80% capacity and also has 1 000 out-patients. A means test determines payments with a maximum of R258 per day for the first 30 days for long-term patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Built as a family home in 1938, it was transformed into an army headquarters during World War II. In 1945 it became a plastic surgery unit, and later a psychiatric hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hospital caters for patients as young as 12, and also has a child clinic. A children's ward is planned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ward 3 mainly treats teenage patients, such as Jenny (not her real name) who, when admitted three months ago for anorexia, weighed 34kg. &quot;I don't want to be fat, I want to be thin, I want people to like me,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An economics student, she describes the anorexic programme &quot;as very hard&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sophie, a 27-year-old former office secretary, is in Ward 1. She has been there for six weeks and says she believes she will be a bulimic until she dies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a few minutes later she says: &quot;I believe there's a light at the end of the tunnel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She adds: &quot;I know I have a very low self- esteem and lack of confidence.  The point of me being here is to get better so that I never come back&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jane is a 23-year-old schizophrenic. &quot;I felt my parents were against me and I reverted to taking acid which would send me on a six-hour trip,&quot; she says. &quot; Sometimes I get a natural high, where I feel very warm inside and I think I have special powers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jane continues: &quot;Nurses here are cool, they are very nice.&quot; Her treatment consists of group therapy where patients talk about their disorders and try to establish a &quot;better understanding of ourselves&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;Or Zola: Refuge for one day a week</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A FAR cry from the upper-class conditions and surroundings at Tara is the Zola Clinic in Soweto. Established ten years ago, the Zola clinic looks from the outside like a small shopping centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A three-metre high brick-wall with razor wire running around the top surrounds the building. A few faded graffiti, mainly old political slogans, are on the walls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The functions of this primary health-care clinic include caring for up to 800 psychiatric patients a month, mainly schizophrenics and people suffering from depression. Struggling for finance, the clinic was recently able to carry out improvements - such as providing doors for the psychiatric ward's offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of the rehabilitation programme, patients take turns every day to clean the ward. Outside, young men work at making a small wooden bench for the ward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ernest (45) makes frames for paintings and photographs. &quot;It helps me forget about my problems,&quot; he says, while showing how to spell his name. He is a schizophrenic but due to the treatment he has received at the clinic he is able to help himself, thereby earning &quot;a few extra rand&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His friend Cedric (28) - also a schizophrenic - is painting &quot;Mother Mary&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I like it here, it's quiet and I can paint,&quot; he says. &quot;My life has been very difficult but I feel happier when I'm painting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Debbi Gould, a psychologist at the Zola clinic, believes the patients' families should become more involved with care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some chronic patients should be treated by families and really sick ones should go to halfway houses during the day, where they can come closer to the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gould says that institutions such as Tara can be &quot;bad because patients are alienated from the community&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She believes that the patients and staff at the clinic use &quot;space better&quot; than at Tara. &quot;There's not a rigid format here like they have at other institutions with better resources,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gould and the ward's head nurse, Dumi Masondo, stress the need for community involvement in the care of mental patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must make the community more aware that psychiatric patients must be treated with care and understanding,&quot; says Ma-sondo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She says they are paid very little by the government and have to earn their own money to offer proper facilities. &quot;We need halfway houses and remedial schools because we have kids who can't go to normal schools,&quot; says Masondo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's the pattern for the future? Tara or Zola? Asked this, health department representative Mervyn Freeman said the government was focusing more on primary health-care clinics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, hospitals like Tara were needed and would remain, he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A gabled mansion in the heart of Kensington, the eastern Johannesburg suburb, served as a &quot;safe&quot; house for intelligence operatives in the Security Police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was at this house in the late 1970s and early 1980s where reports submitted by journalists who were informers were scrutinised before being consolidated and sent on to police headquarters in Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a former security police agent, John Horak, the house had been rented from its owner by a security policeman posing as a debt collector.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Horak says that, to his knowledge, he was one of only two &quot;agents&quot; who operated for the security police on the country's newspapers. An agent was, he says, a career policeman who worked as a journalist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only other agent he knows of was Gerard Ludi, who was a journalist on the Rand Daily Mail in the early 1960s and who infiltrated the underground Communist Party. He testified against party members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, there were informers. All newspapers, English and Afrikaans, had them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Horak says, as a guess, that there were 12 or 13 informers at the South African Associated Newspapers (now Times Media Limited) during the 1970s and 1980s. Journalists were poorly paid and those who were informers were usually motivated by need rather than ideology, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The going rate in the early 1980s for informers was between R200 and R1 000 a month, he says, and this was good money for journalists when, for example the salary of the political correspondent of the Sunday Express in July 1980 was less than R1 000 a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also says that many journalists who did not want formally to become informers, or who were not as liberal as the newspapers they worked for, would pass on valuable intelligence because of their ideological beliefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to Norman Chandler, the senior journalist at the Johannesburg newspaper The Star whose work as a police informer was reported in last week's Mail &amp; Guardian, Horak says: &quot;His motive was money. The first time he came to me, in about 1978, he was in trouble with a phone bill. He asked to be reconnected with the security police, and so I passed on the information, and he was put on the books.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The next time he came to me was after the Rand Daily Mail had closed (in April 1985). He had gone to work for a public relations company and was retrenched and in trouble over a car he had bought. Once again I connected him.&quot; Chandler has denied he ever worked for the security police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Horak has given the M&amp;G several names of journalists he says were police informers. Some are now dead, others have left the country, and a few are still in the media. Those still in South Africa may be approached for information by investigators putting together a submission on the press for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to informers in the press who reported to the security police, journalists worked for the then-South African Defence Force, national intelligence and foreign affairs in South Africa, elsewhere in Africa and overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As more names of apartheid-era informers in the media become public in the next few months there will probably be few surprises in the press. Many journalists suspected who among them were spies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conversely, in the climate of paranoia fostered by knowledge of the existence of informers, there was also a good deal of finger-pointing at innocent people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) councillor Lyndall Shope-Mafole insisted this week that she and her colleagues have done nothing wrong and have nothing for which to apologise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was responding to the auditor general's final report on the IBA, presented to Parliament on Wednesday, which criticised the organisation's dire financial controls and misuse of company credit cards and travel allowances. The report did not single out individual miscreants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within hours, the IBA councillors named in the auditor general's interim report, leaked last month, called a press conference and said they would not resign.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shope-Mafole - one of the IBA councillors accused in the interim report of using her credit card for R70 000 private purchases and of enjoying an excessively expensive lifestyle at the taxpayers' expense - said there had been many misconceptions about the councillors' use of their credit cards. &quot;I just think it is not looked at in its proper context. We had a policy which said that if we use them (the cards) for private purposes we have to pay it back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said many other organisations had similar systems, but that the IBA's policy had been changed last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She denied a statement in the auditor general's interim report that the council had ruled in August 1994 that the cards were meant for business use only.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody can say there was any unauthorised use of credit cards,&quot; Shope- Mafole said. &quot;The use of credit cards was done in terms of a policy that was agreed to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shope-Mafole said that she and other councillors had merely borrowed money from the taxpayer temporarily. As far as the tardy reimbursement of private credit card expenditure was concerned, she simply did not have the time. &quot;If you put it in context ... we never had time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She showed a file of cheques she had made out to the IBA saying, &quot;Nobody had to tell me to do this. I did it myself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IBA's council has yet to decide on the fate of its CEO, Harris Gxaweni, who has received a vote of no-confidence from staff. The original complaints by staff about IBA profligacy and mismanagement triggered the auditor general's probe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shope-Mafole said it was possible that Gxaweni would not be fired. She said he had arrived at the IBA when there were barely any policies in place and that the council could not blame everything on him. &quot;As the council we are the final people who are accountable for everything related to the IBA. We can't go and blame the CEO.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added that no councillor had exceeded the limits imposed on their credit cards. &quot;It could be open to abuse. I could buy Manhattan,&quot; she joked.  Asked whether the IBA owed an apology to taxpayers, she said: &quot;Not really in the sense that we have misused money ... To apologise for what?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shope-Mafole said the main lesson to be learnt from the report was that the IBA had to devote more time to setting up necessary policies. She defended her trips to Geneva, where she represents South Africa at the International Telecommunications Union. &quot;For me the IBA is the primary task that the people of South Africa have given me. For me, I dedicate a lot of time, energy and emotion to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, the IBA is one small element in the overall building of South Africa. I believe I have tasks that are broader than just the IBA. I have other tasks as a citizen and as a person who has been actively involved in the struggle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about her grilling in the press over the interim auditor general's report while she was overseas, she said: &quot;I have thought of suing, but I haven't had the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IBA's Staff Representative Committee was unavailable for comment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The dream of founding a new National Party is over for Roelf Meyer, courtesy of the NP's elite, reports Marion Edmunds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FALLEN National Party hero, Roelf Meyer, has been outmanoeuvred by his opponents. His more conservative colleagues, led by executive director Marthinus van Schalkwyk and Western Cape Premier Hernus Kriel, pressured leader FW de Klerk to take sides against Meyer for the first time this week, to crush his attempts to build the foundations of a new party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Klerk moved swiftly to close down Meyer's show on Wednesday, disbanding his task team and taking over its mission for himself. This leaves Kriel, Van Schalkwyk and, to a lesser extent, KwaZulu-Natal's Danie Schutte the party's chief strategic players. Meyer stands, humiliated, on the brink of resigning.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Schalkwyk wants the party to be a &quot;centre-right&quot; party, which will attract alliance partners in the run-up to the coming elections by virtue of providing an alternative to the African National Congress. Kriel wants to perpetuate power in the Western Cape by attracting Afrikaans-speaking coloured and white voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Loose talk from Meyer's camp of &quot;disbanding&quot; the party and rash task-team discussions with ANC dissidents, threatened the future of the NP elite who believed Meyer's moves and stance were premature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The elite's patience with Meyer snapped when the issue of disbanding emerged earlier this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we had all stuck to the rules it should not have happened,&quot; Kriel said.  &quot;The disbandment of the party was never an option. The task team was a procedural thing. It was meant to work with parties in Parliament; look forward towards an election alliance in 1999, like the sort in which the ANC participates; and from there to have established something new like a party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a party would only have been formed in the next century, but the elections would have played an important unifying role among alliance parties.  Kriel also indicated that he was not happy with the calibre of people Meyer had approached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meyer's Gauteng support base was counting the cost of their hero's demise this week. &quot;I do not think that De Klerk is the right person to form a new movement,&quot; said a Gauteng party stalwart. &quot;He is so tainted by the truth commission and we know that black people do not like him, like they like Roelf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Roelf moves around, he has a real vibe with black people ... and now the whole idea of a new movement will be hijacked by the Democratic Party and I will probably be joining them too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meyer is now seeking guidance from such supporters before deciding his next move. Staying on looks unlikely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His efforts to pull the party on to new ground have been thrown back in his face and his leadership has been compromised - since 1994 he has slid from star negotiator, to Cabinet minister, to secretary general, to task-team convenor and now to plain MP. Other members of the task team are likely to follow him out of the door.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - An African National Congress decision to back away from efforts to put Bushbuckridge in the Northern Province under the control of neighbouring Mpumalanga sparked the rioting that is rocking the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC decision, according to local residents, was taken at a meeting in the middle of last month attended by representatives of Mpumalanga and Northern Province. Deputy President Thabo Mbeki chaired the meeting at the start, but left before the Bushbuckridge discussion; the ANC's acting secretary general, Cheryl Carolus, took over the chair from him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC officials in Bushbuckridge say the meeting agreed to scrap negotiations, under way since 1994, to shift the border. The decision was subsequently leaked to local ANC leaders, some of whom then called for a three-week work stayaway and blockades of roads through the area.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those protests turned violent last week, when Bushbuckridge residents torched government buildings, destroyed lorries and clashed with police sent from Pietersburg to quell the unrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violence subsided but heated up again late this week, when residents burnt a bus. Riot police and army troops are in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It became very clear to us that people had decided the border would not be shifted,&quot; said Azaph Nxumalo, representative of the Bushbuckridge Border Committee, about the ANC's decision that led to the protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the rioting, representatives of the two provinces met on Wednesday in Nelspruit at a meeting also attended by Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that meeting the provincial and regional executive committees accepted the decision that the boundary would not be shifted, said Minister of Constitutional Affairs Mohammed Valli Moosa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this week, Bushbuckridge local leaders were vowing to continue their struggle. &quot;Come wind, come rain, come hurricane or tornado, they want to go to Mpumalanga,&quot; said Freddy Mathebula, regional chair of the ANC in Bushbuckridge. &quot;The people of Bushbuckridge have spoken.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dispute has been simmering since provincial boundaries were drawn up in 1994. The parliaments of Mpumalanga and Northern Province have approved resolutions to transfer Bushbuckridge to Mpumalanga, but it would involve a quid-pro-quo trade with the town of Groblersdal, which would shift to Northern Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Party opposes the transfer of Groblersdal, saying its residents are content to stay in Mpuma-langa. Without the NP's support it will not be possible to gain the two-thirds majority in Parliament required to alter provincial borders. The ANC has not approached the NP's leaders about gaining support for the border shift.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC leaders in Northern Province have also said they would not consider a transfer of Bushbuckridge without receiving Groblersdal. They say they do not see the Bushbuckridge issue as a border dispute at all: it is a political and security problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are part of a single country, with one president, in which internal boundaries should not make a significant difference to us,&quot; said Kenny Mathivha, a representative of Northern Province Premier Ngoako Ramatlhodi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the protests, black smoke poured into the sky from burning lorries along roads through Bushbuckridge. Teenagers shattered the windows of cars and bakkies trying to drive past the blockades. Crowds surrounded lorries that failed to get through, smashing them with rocks, pouring petrol into the cabs and setting them alight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women pulled vegetables from the back of one smouldering lorry while young children looked on. Police leapt from Casspirs with shotguns aimed at the scattering crowds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Helicopters circled overhead with riot police leaning out with weapons; people darted for cover into nearby shops,. They said police in helicopters had fired rubber bullets and teargas into the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hunkering under the shelter of an overhanging roof, residents in the village of Marite near Bushbuckridge explained why they want so desperately to fall under the administration of Mpumalanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Northern Province, they said, is incapable of providing the development projects needed in the area: at night, the village goes dark because it lacks electricity; water is only available from the occasional public tap; schools lack textbooks; the roads are badly deteriorated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you look across the provincial border into Mpumalanga, where many of the residents of Bushbuckridge work and do their shopping, these problems are not so pronounced, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Driving to the top of a hill, you can see how heavily populated the area is, as small homes dot the countryside all the way to the horizon. Bushbuckridge is populated by 750 000 people by one estimate; others put the number at more than a million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a region of rolling hillsides and thick bush, bordered by the Kruger National Park to the east and the Drakensberg escarpment on the west. Its history is marked by ethnic battles and poverty, partly because of its former division between the Lebowa and Gazankulu homelands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One recent study showed that parts of the region have an average monthly household income of about R500, much of which is generated by residents working in Gauteng or on white-owned farms to the north and south of the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've suffered a long time under Northern Province,&quot; said one man as he enjoyed a beer across the street from a burnt-out bakkie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The barricades put up by residents were peaceful until the afternoon of May 1, when Valli Moosa failed to show up at a Worker's Day rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Locals took this as a sign that the government is not taking their demands seriously. Shortly after the rally, people burnt the government offices in the village of Shatale and clashed with police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Valli Moosa has explained that he did not know that he had been invited to a Worker's Day rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the violence does not convince ANC leaders to renew efforts to shift the border, those manning the Marite barricade talk of another threat: that the people of Bushbuckridge will not go to the polls in 1999.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Stuart Hess and Mungo Soggot report on a case that takes the failure of the courts to protect the public to a new extreme</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAMOKGETHI MALEBANA is missing. Lots of children go missing in South Africa.  But the disappearance of this seven-year-old child from Katlehong is a shocking indictment of the country's criminal justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The failure of the courts to protect the public from those whom the police believe to be dangerous criminals - by granting them bail on the presumption of innocence - has been the subject of controversy in the past when killers have been released to kill again. But the case of Mamokgethi Malebana takes the betrayal of innocence to a new extreme.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She was a clever girl who always liked to go to church,&quot; says her grandmother, Sara Malebana. &quot;She was playful and people loved her.&quot; The girl's mother is still too upset to talk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not the first time Mamokgethi has disappeared. On November 10 last year she failed to return home from a trip to the local shop. Her mother, Joyce Malebana, and grandmother went looking for her. Children playing in the street said they had seen her entering the home of a neighbour, Dan Mabote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two women went into the house and found the child lying on Mabote's bed, crying. They called the police from the house of another neighbour, who had a phone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police came to arrest Mabote ... three days later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next day, 29-year-old Mabote appeared in the Germiston Regional Court.  On three charges of rape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It transpired that, before the alleged attack on Mamokgethi, he had been accused of raping a four-year-old and a six-year- old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the magistrate, James van Wyk, released Mabote on R2 000 in the face of a police request that he be held in custody as a danger to the public. The case was remanded until March 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 25, Mamokgethi failed to return home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mabote appeared before the court the next day, the magistrate was told of the child's disappearance. He postponed the case to May 29 ... again allowing Mabote out on bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A social worker employed by a local mental health centre, Ekupholeni, investigated and discovered Mabote had been absent from a Germiston car factory where he worked on the day Mamokgethi went missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was also discovered that on that day Mabote had visited a local school and had fetched a 10-year-old boy - explaining that he was taking him and other children to hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The boy told the social worker that, on Mabote's instructions, he had collected Mamokgethi from her school and had taken her to Mabote's house. It was the last that was seen of the child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A week later Mabote, still out on bail, was cornered by members of the local street committee and police had to rescue him from a lynching. That was the last that was seen of Mabote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in Katlehong told the Mail &amp; Guardian this week they had had no evidence on which to charge Mabote with kidnapping the missing girl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The magistrate said he could not remember the case. &quot;I hear many cases every day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief director of social services for the Gauteng government, Janette du Preez, said: &quot;We rely heavily on the community for information, and there is nothing one can do if there is no input from the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pravienna Naidoo, the personal assistant to Gauteng's MEC for Welfare and Population Development, Ignatius Jacobs, said: &quot;It is happening all the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of Justice Dullah Omar has said he wants the law changed so the courts will refuse bail for serious crimes - an initiative given new emphasis earlier this year following an outcry over high-profile rape cases. He also wants magistrates to play a far more inquisitorial role in bail hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omar said this week Mamokgethi's story was a &quot;very serious matter&quot;, but he did not know details of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Mamokgethi Malebana is missing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Publications Control Board has banned a movie already flighted several times in South Africa and, for the first time ever, a poster for a film.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caligula, produced in 1980 by Bob Guccione of Penthouse magazine and directed by Tinto Brass, tells the story of the decadent Roman whose rule was characterised by violence and sexual abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film drew the talents of people like Malcolm McDowell, Sir John Gielgud, Helen Mirren and Peter O'Toole, but was roundly lambasted partly because Guccione recut the film, inserting 40 minutes of sex scenes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially banned in South Africa, Caligula did play with special permission at the Weekly Mail Film Festival in 1993, for a week in 1995 at Cape Town's Labia under the same conditions, and at Johannesburg's Seven Arts last year for six weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But such showings seem to have escaped the censors, who used the 1974 Publications Act to ban Caligula last month, after the Labia resubmitted the film for approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Caligula was notorious for his cruelty and vices but the explicit and violent depiction, especially the sexual violence, for example the rape of Olivia and Proculis, the bloody castration scene with a dog licking up the blood and eating same is totally nauseating,&quot; the board's ruling concludes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The film is riddled with lengthy and explicit scenes of rape, masturbation, oral sex and ejaculation (showing penetration), cunnilingus, fellatio, voyeurism, necrophilia, homosexuality, full frontal nudity, close-ups of genitals (male and female), a female urinating while another fondles her, plus murder and torture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All this is dehumanising, degrading, decadent and the depiction of debauchery in such gross detail, revelling in the sexual aspects, renders the film as being pornographic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board's chairman, Braam Coetzee, says his censors did not know that the film had already been played, but adds: &quot;Queer things happen in this country nowadays.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board has also decided to ban the poster for the film Female Perversions - a poster Coetzee &quot;personally&quot; found &quot;beautiful&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The independent art movie - which did get the board's approval, with an age 18 restriction - is about a high-powered attorney (played by British actress Tilda Swinton) who dumps her boyfriend for a woman psychiatrist. Described by overseas critics as a &quot;decidedly off-beat, psychological drama about sexual roles, gender issues and identity in modern society&quot;, the film is based on Louise J Kaplan's learned but obscure Freudian feminist treatise exploring the complex issues of female sexuality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its poster shows a woman tied up while other women try to clasp her - which offended the board because of its &quot;suggestions of bondage and lesbianism,&quot; Coetzee says. &quot;The committee found that because posters are blatantly displayed it was undesirable. You can't put an age restriction on a poster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Distributor Ster-Kinekor is now submitting a toned-down version of the poster, relocating the film's title to obscure the poster's one visible nipple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board, meanwhile, is due next week to face another assault on its sensitivities - watching Mira Nair's latest film, Kama Sutra, scripted by South African Helena Kriel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board's Indian equivalent recently demanded that 14 minutes be cut from the film. Nair took legal action, saving 12 of the 14 minutes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Kader Asmal has quietly lifted South Africa's embargo on arms to Turkey, which has killed thousands and displaced millions of Kurds.  Marion Edmunds reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOUTH AFRICA has quietly lifted its embargo on arms sales to Turkey.  Minister of Water and Forestry Affairs, Kader Asmal, who presides over regulation of government arms sales, said this week that the embargo had been conditionally lifted for &quot;political&quot; reasons in South Africa's interest.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian understands from other government officials that the embargo, in place since August 1995, had been viewed as an obstacle to South Africa's attempts to forge stronger ties with Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not known which arms Turkey might be interested in buying, nor how much money could be involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move gives Turkey a much needed new arms supply. Its normal suppliers in Europe and the United States have reportedly halted their trade, sickened by the country's fight with its Kurdish population. The war has claimed thousands of lives and displaced millions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision also represents another foray by South Africa into the arms- hungry Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turkey spent more than $6,2-billion on defence last year, and is striving to strengthen military ties with Israel - extending now to planned joint naval manoeuvres. It has also accused its Arab neighbours of trying to foment radical Islamism in Turkey, and of backing the Kurds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turkey's initiatives have outraged Arab states, including Syria and Libya.  The South African government has previously mooted a R3-billion arms sale to Syria, and views Libya as a long-time ally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's embargo on sales to Turkey preceded the investigation of arms exports which led to the creation of the National Conventional Arms Control Committeee. The committee, which Asmal chairs, now oversees permits for international arms marketing and sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The decision to lift conditionally the moratorium on arms sales to Turkey was a political decision which took into consideration all aspects of the rationale and principles that are applicable to the committee,&quot; Asmal said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No single factor would necessarily outweigh any other, as South Africa's interests are always of primary consideration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asmal declined to say whether companies including the state-owned Armscor and Denel had already applied to begin marketing their wares to Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said it was unlikely the committee would agree to allow South African arms to be sold for use in the country's fight with its Kurds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a delegation of Turkish Kurds - briefed by Asmal two weeks ago on the issue - said that South Africa's decision could merely help strengthen Turkey's hand against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turkey's record of dealing with its Kurdish population includes denying them civil liberties and freedom unless they renounce their 4000-year-old culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation includes representatives of the Kurdish parliament-in-exile, and the editor of a pro-Kurdish newspaper. He said 21 of his journalists had been murdered by Turkish state assassins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Turks have razed 3 000 Kurdish villages to the ground and are driving the people to squatter camps on the fringes of the city,&quot; said one delegate, speaking on condition of anonymity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They call the guerrillas who hide in the mountains the fish, and the villages the sea, and they say to get the fish they have to drain the sea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Centre for Conflict Resolution in Cape Town questioned Asmal's interpretation of South Africa's interests. &quot;South Africa's values as contained in our Bill of Rights are of primary consideration,&quot; said director Laurie Nathan. &quot;Where interests and values clash, constitutional values should prevail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arms ruling is ironic for Asmal, who, as an exile and human rights activist, had championed the Kurds' cause.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - A multi-millionaire nephew of Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko is being sued for child maintenance in Cape Town's High Court. Bundu Te Litho, who lives in the city's plush Fresnaye suburb, is believed to be worth at least $500-million - cash inherited from the late Litho Mabote, Mobutu's brother and the mastermind behind his schemes to suck Zaire dry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Te Litho is being sued for $120 000 (R535 000) in maintenance arrears allegedly owed to a former New York model, Gail Kendrick, for their daughter.  Kendrick gave up her career to marry Te Litho, move to Zaire and bear him a daughter in 1984.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three then enjoyed five years of &quot;magnificently ostentatious jet- setting in private residences (belonging to Te Litho) in Monte Carlo, Switzerland, Belgium, France, Italy, Spain and the US&quot; before Kendrick said she ended the relationship due to Te Litho's &quot;escalating infidelity&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She alleges he refused to pay maintenance, and tried to kidnap the child when he visited the United States on official trips with Mobutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kendrick's lawyer, Bruce Stephens, says Te Litho has made South Africa his home and has permanent residence, but has failed to appear in court, apparently blaming the civil war in Zaire. Te Litho paid R1,6- million for his Fresnaye home in 1985, and is thought to have several export companies operating in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu and his other relatives also have extensive assets in South Africa, although many are registered under other names.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu's substantial property portfolio in the Western Cape includes a Clifton beach house, homes in the Boland towns of Stellenbosch and Franschhoek, and a horse- breeding farm in Tokai. His wife owns a hotel in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such assets are dwarfed, however, by the assets the family has offshore, which include a string of mansions in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States got a brief glimpse of bank records in 1981 showing roughly $1- billion in liquid Mobutu assets in Europe at that time - records which Te Litho revealed to American lawyers as he sought to secure his inheritance from his dead father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Te Litho refused this week to comment about the maintenance case, which is due to resume on June 3.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kinshasa - Leopold Muando's first venture into futuristic art sits among his realist paintings of Zairean soldiers tearing Kinshasa apart and the ever- present trauma of Aids. Muando's imagination has conjured up a vision of a skeletal Mobutu Sese Seko prostrate before a towering foe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grinning conqueror with his foot on the Zairean president's chest is the rebel leader, Laurent Kabila. It is a fantasy that many in the last citadel of Mobutu's regime would delight in seeing a reality.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you think it will end like this?&quot; Muando asked. &quot;People want to see Mobutu suffer for all the suffering he has caused us. But I don't think it will be like this. Mobutu will still die better than most of us have lived.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far there have been no takers for the painting on sale at a Kinshasa roadside. But among those drawn to its vision, it reignites the seemingly endless debate on the capital's streets about what the looming finale of the civil war will bring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kinshasa has its back to the Congo river. The rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire claims it is within 60km of the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What remains of the regime's power is concentrated in the bunker of Mobutu's mind. Nowadays his circle comprises mostly close relatives. The wider political family has been discarded in favour of seemingly stronger, and therefore more reliable, blood ties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the only real influence Mobutu wields is over the immediate fate of Kinshasa's five million people. It still lies within the ailing president's hands to decide whether the capital goes down in flames or if the rebels can take their last and greatest prize with as little bloodshed as most other cities have fallen during their astonishing 1 500km sweep across Zaire in little more than six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pretoria and Washington's mediation efforts are met with scepticism in Kinshasa. Muando is not alone in fearing they may all be an elaborate international plot to extend Mobutu's power even at this late stage. &quot;We are suspicious because Mobutu is very sly and the Americans are very sly. They were his friends for 30 years. Kabila must be careful. He must know that people want him to come here and if the Americans or French try to keep Mobutu in power people will take their revenge. They must do nothing to stop Kabila coming here,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there are those who have deluded themselves into believing that the thousands of British, American and French troops massed across the Congo river in Brazzaville are waiting to pounce and seize Kinshasa on Kabila's behalf while Mobutu is out of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the foreign troops give some comfort to Kinshasans. Perhaps the threat of intervention to rescue foreigners will discourage the Zairean army from one last destructive rampage in the final collapse. The greatest danger for the capital lies not in a full scale military assault but in a total disintegration in power and order before the rebels are able to move in and assert their authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most people would settle for jeering Mobutu as he fled, and welcoming the rebels with open arms. But Kinshasa has become the point of last retreat for many old Mobutu loyalists and no one is certain how they will react.  Kinshasans fear that those who face losing everything would rather take the capital down with them with one last, grand looting, by which the army pillaging of 1991 and 1993 would pale in comparison. For weeks now, the wealthy have been spiriting their families out of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The few banks with foreign currency have been drained of American dollars and Belgian francs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Builders are doing a flourishing trade throwing up walls around vulnerable homes. Not so many people venture out after dark anymore. Gangs of youths have taken to hijacking cars. Murders are on the rise. Pamphlets issued in the rebels' name this week appeared on Kinshasa's streets. They reassured the population that the Alliance's &quot;valiant combatants&quot; have already infiltrated the capital. The leaflets appealed to the population to remain calm and to demonstrate support for the rebels by wearing white headbands. And they called on people to support those elements of the army that back the rebels, and to &quot;throw into oblivion&quot; those who remain loyal to Mobutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there is undoubted backing for the rebels in Kinshasa, as yet few people feel secure enough to demonstrate it openly by wearing symbols of support. But there was no shortage of readers to snatch up the many newspapers that specialise in wild conspiracies - from claims that Mobutu is really a prisoner on a South African ship to a report that his final act will be to bombard Kinshasa with radiation from an experimental nuclear reactor at the university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politicians and diplomats have been poring over what is said to be a hit list drawn up by the Presidential Guard. The politicians figure high, including Mobutu's last prime minister, Kengo wa Dondo, who the army accuses of ripping off millions of dollars in arms contracts. But he is safely ensconced in Switzerland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Mobutu flew out of Kinshasa this week, after Kabila gave him three days to depart or be &quot;chased from power&quot;. Foreign diplomats, who have been trying to massage Mobutu from office to avoid a battle for Kinshasa, cautiously anticipated he may finally have given up the struggle to cling to power after 32 years. But the Zairean leader's aides insist he will return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other Mobutu cronies have also left Zaire. General Kpama Baramoto, the Zairean president's brother-in-law and former army chief of staff, has bolted for South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu's high command said it would fight on and claimed to have reversed the rebel advance in what appeared a last ditch attempt to stall, if not halt, the rebel advance. Heavy fighting was reported around the town of Kikwit, about 200km east of the capital. Residents of villages in the area said the numbers of government troops had risen sharply in recent days, including Portuguese speaking men presumed to be members of Angola's Unita, which has long and close ties to Mobutu. But Kabila's rebels have also been sighted much closer to the south of Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Text of questions and answers by State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns on Zaire at the Department's daily briefing May 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Zaire, if you would, please. Is Mobutu coming back, do you suppose? Does the U.S. have any late word on any possible negotiations over transition?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: We don't know if President Mobutu will be returning to Kinshasa after his visit to Gabon. We know he has met there with President Bongo and other leaders from nearby African states. This is a decision that he alone can make.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You know that Ambassador Richardson was in Paris today briefing the French Government on the results of his diplomatic mission. Ambassador Richardson is now returning to the United States. The United States' objectives, as we watch this transition taking place, are to first of all, end the fighting, achieve a cease-fire; second, to ensure respect for human rights, the human rights of the citizens of Zaire; and third, to try to promote, along with South Africa and the United Nations and others, a peaceful transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no question that that transition is underway with the continued march towards Kinshasa of the rebel alliance. That alliance military victory seems likely in the coming days. But the future of Zaire is at risk.  Ambassador Richardson spoke to this today in Paris. The citizens of Zaire, the international community and the United States are going to judge the alliance and Mr. Kabila on the way they comport themselves in this endgame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As you know, we have had many concerns about the treatment of refugees in and around Kisangani. We have made those clear to Mr. Kabila, and we have now received assurances from him that those refugees will be well treated and that they will be allowed to leave through the assistance of the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the test here is to make sure that the actions, as well as the words of the rebel alliance, meet a basic international standard. We would submit a standard that the Zairian people would also want to have for their own government. That test is, will the rebel alliance proceed in a democratic fashion? We hope it will, and that is where your attentions are directed.  Will it respect the human rights of the citizens of the country? And will the rebel alliance work cooperatively with President Mobutu and with others in Kinshasa to avoid a bloodbath, to avoid bloodshed, and to make sure that the end, the victory of this military alliance, which is undoubtedly going to happen, that that takes place in a peaceful way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Do you have any word on whether Mobutu or the people he left behind are now willing to take U.S. advice and enter negotiations for their -- obviously, for their demise with the advancing rebels?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: We do not know, Barry, what President Mobutu intends to do now that the Libreville meetings have concluded. His spokesman says that he'll be returning to Kinshasa tomorrow. We don't know if that will take place or not.  We'll have to wait and see, along with the rest of you, how that happens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We do hope that President Mobutu and Mr. Kabila might be able to meet. As you know, the South Africans and the UN are talking about a possible meeting next week. Before that happens, we hope that their seconds, their advisers, could be in close touch so that the fighting might cease - and there is terrible fighting today, 150 kilometers from the capital - and that the transition that is clearly underway can proceed in a non-violent way so that the citizens of Kinshasa are not subjected to war on their streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Two questions - despite all the efforts, Richardson's efforts and what not, you still have not - correct me if I'm wrong, it sounds like you still have not gotten a reliable commitment from Kabila that there will not be a bloodbath in Kinshasa; is that correct?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Well, I would just say that I think Ambassador Richardson's trip was very successful because he helped along - obviously, under the leadership of the South Africans and the UN - to put together the meeting they had.  There is now the promise of a second meeting. I refer you to Mr. Kabila's public comments. He said that he'd be willing, as you remember, to have a period of time to allow for a transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, unfortunately, I don't know who started the fighting first in Kenge, but there has been fighting, and very severe fighting and many hundreds of people have died. Who is at fault; who started the fighting? We can't say. We just know that both sides - the government and the rebels - ought to be responsible for putting together a cease-fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: That wasn't the question, though. Let me try it again. Do you feel you have a commitment from Kabila to do what you want him to do, which is to say not have a bloodbath when his forces come into Kinshasa? Do you have that commitment?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I think we understand from our conversations with Mr. Kabila that he'd very much like to avoid that. He, however, says also that he is determined to take the capital. Our view is that he and others need to be mindful of their own actions, which are a test of their credibility. There is no reason for bloodshed in Kinshasa. There ought to be a way to develop a peaceful transition in the coming days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, we are encouraged by the statements by the South Africans and the UN today that there might be a meeting next week. Obviously, Mr. Kabila, as well as President Mobutu ought to put their efforts into peaceful meetings, dialogue, rather than storming a capital city with many hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of innocent people in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: So the answer is no, there is no commitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Whether it's a commitment or not, we're going to have to judge Mr. Kabila, as well as others in the region, on their actions. We'll be watching the actions closely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: The other question is, how - also given the groundwork that Richardson has supposedly laid -- how much cooperation are you getting from Angola and Museveni and others who are in a position to put pressure on Kabila to do what you want him to do, which is no bloodbath, democracy and all that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Yes, much of what Ambassador Richardson did this week, as you know, was to travel to neighboring countries to reaffirm the view of the United States as well as the United Nations that there ought to be peaceful transitions, and that neighboring countries ought not to contribute to continued warfare, but ought to contribute to a peaceful ending in Zaire. We will have to judge some of those countries by their actions, as well, as you know, because there have been widespread reports obviously of some of these countries - not necessarily the ones you named -- but some surrounding countries have been involved in the fighting, in running guns to one side or another. We just think that all efforts in Africa, Central Africa, these days ought to be turned towards a peaceful ending, a soft landing, for the current government and for the transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: So despite all of Richardson's efforts, despite the U.S. holding up Museveni and others in the region as progressive, new African leaders, it sounds, again, as if you have no real commitment from them. Or you see no real evidence from them that they are encouraging Kabila to do what you want him to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Well, I think the government that we would praise in Africa is the South African Government, which has acted in the interest of preserving -- of trying to re-instill peace, and to protect innocent civilians. Millions of people are caught up in this civil war. The South African Government has been true to its word and has really been the world leader on this crisis. We have tried to support the role of the South African Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think other governments will have to live with what they are doing. We will judge them, obviously. I think others will, as well, the United Nations, on how they comport themselves. We don't think this is a time to stimulate further fighting. We think this is the time to stimulate peace and a peaceful transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Nick, have you all begun to focus on the issue of Mobutu's assets and what should happen as he leaves, if he leaves? What should happen to his assets in the United States; his assets perhaps in Switzerland, which denied yesterday they had any?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I'm sure that's a question for Mr. Mobutu to ponder, as well as for those who are going to be involved in the transition. I'm not sure that the United States ought to have, or does have, any kind of direct responsibility for that particular issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Do you know if he has assets here?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I do not know personally if President Mobutu has financial assets or real estate in the United States. But you know, we have laws in this country the govern the actions of any citizen or any foreigner who has financial assets here. I'm sure our laws will be upheld. But I am just not aware that the United States Government sees itself as the primary actor responsible for adjudicating that issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Are you looking into it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Are we looking into that issue? I think really it is an issue for Mr. Mobutu and for the Zairian Government. It is obviously a very serious issue in Zaire itself, given the extent of the financial empire of the Mobutu family. But it is not something, I think, that the United States would publicly want to position itself on right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am sure that American diplomats have given this some thought, and I am sure we have our views on this. I am sure we have talked to others about our views. But I don't think it is appropriate for us to surface those publicly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Nick, why is Bill Richardson calling for a second summit between Mobutu and Mr. Laurent Kabila? Did they fail to make a deal in the first meeting on this transition of power and the safety of Kinshasa?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: As you know, President Mandela announced, after the first meeting on the South African naval vessel, that there ought to be and he hoped that there would be a second meeting. We believe that in meeting, the two leaders might be able to agree on a transition that would avoid bloodshed in Kinshasa and save people's lives, and make sure that a transition preserves at least what Zaire has now physically and in their people, rather than subject the population any further to civil war. That is a very compelling reason to seek a second meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: No such arrangement was made, then, in the first meeting on the ship?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I would just draw you attention to President Mandela's public comments, and Deputy President Mbeki's public comments at the time, and Ambassador Richardson's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Nick, there has been reporting that there are large numbers of Zairians who are getting ferries and planes out of Kinshasa these days. Do we know the degree to which Mobutu's backers, families, government officials may be leaving the country?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: There have been widespread reports that a number of government officials have left or are considering leaving Kinshasa by a variety of means.  I don't think it's our responsibility or, frankly, our position to report on who those people are and what they're doing. It's not our - we don't want to get in the way of anyone's personal security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Are there people there to pick up the phone when the U.S. Embassy calls the government of Mobutu?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Yes, I can tell you that Ambassador Simpson, in recent days, has had high-level meetings with the most senior officials in the Zairian Government, and even since President Mobutu departed for Gabon. So there are people answering the phones. The government is working. It's not working very well, obviously, under the circumstances. It hasn't worked well for a number of years. But under the current circumstances, the government is obviously stretched thin. We do want this transition to take place peacefully and in an orderly way and, again, because that helps the people of Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Do you think that there will be a second meeting if, as you predict, Kabila's troops take Kinshasa? What would be the point of him meeting with a dictator who's obviously powerless?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Well, I think we all have to face reality here. As John said yesterday, we have to face reality, and the reality is the rebel alliance is on the verge of a total military victory in Zaire. That's the reality. But there is going to be a transition. Now, how that transition proceeds is now the key question. Rather than a continued military march on the capital city, with the attendant loss of life and bloodshed, we would like to see a transitional period worked out by meetings between either President Mobutu and Mr. Kabila, or their advisers. If the South Africans can engineer such a meeting that would avoid a military barrage of Kinshasa, that would be something the United States would strongly favor and support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: But, as you and others have pointed out, this government of Mobutu is, in effect, history. What role would he play in a transition, since he has no power? He has no --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I think Mr. Kabila has set the terms publicly. He has said, Kabila has said if President Mobutu is not willing to leave, there will be a fight for Kinshasa. If he is willing to leave, there's a possibility of a peaceful transition. Therefore, meetings at this point - diplomatic meetings - ought to be the order of the day -- the wisest and most rational way for everybody to proceed. A way has to be worked out between the current government and the alliance to make a transition of political power and economic power and governance. That ought to be done in a meeting, peacefully, rather than through a fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: (Inaudible) - just if he doesn't go back?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Pardon?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Would there be a transition - because it almost sounds as if - I'm a little confused --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Whether President Mobutu remains in Gabon or travels elsewhere or goes back to Kinshasa, there has to be some kind of discussion to work out a peaceful transition of power. If there isn't that kind of discussion, then we assume that the war will continue and that more people will die. That can't be in anyone's interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: With or without Mobutu in Kinshasa?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: That's correct, because Mobutu's government is in power in Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: What happens if it leads to bloodshed? What will be the consequences for Kabila and his government if there is bloodshed?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I don't want to assume there is going to be one. I don't want to answer a hypothetical question based on that. I would draw you back, Carol, to one of the first things that I said and something that was said much more eloquently by Ambassador Richardson today; and that is that there's a lot at stake for the people of Zaire, and the rebel alliance will be judged on how they comport themselves in the days ahead and the weeks ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: But if you are so vague how - I mean, how can you possibly expect these kinds of words to have resonance there if you are just so vague?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Because we have not been vague in private, where it counts, in meetings with Mr. Kabila. I think he understands what is at stake here. There have been a lot of questions about what happened in Kisangani. Fortunately, the United Nations is now doing a superb job - the UN High Commissioner for Refugees - a superb job of bringing those refugees out of Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kabila understands what is at stake for him and his reputation. He now needs to think about being a responsible person who can lead a government. In anticipation of that, he needs to think about ways to preserve life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: But we --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I should say, I think to be fair, the people who remain in Kinshasa, who have not left and who are currently officials of the Zairian Government, they also have the same responsibility. They need to act in such a way that they preserve human life, preserve order and peace, as much as that can be preserved in this transitional period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: But didn't you state that the American and international companies in Zaire and its mineral resources, I mean, if Kabila takes power in a way that is, you know, you consider inappropriate, I mean, is the United States going to be able to block, you know, World Bank loans and other kinds of investment in the country? Will you deny aid to reconstruct Zaire? I mean, it's important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: But, Carol, you are asking me to answer a hypothetical question, a worst-case hypothetical, and I can't do that. It is not in my interest to do that. Why would I want to answer a question like that? We have to see what Mr. Kabila does first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we hope is that he is going to act in a democratic fashion, in a civilized fashion, with due regard for human life and for peace. That is the standard that needs to be met here. If he meets that standard, we will tell you. If he doesn't meet that standard, we can have this discussion. But I don't want to anticipate negative behavior on his part or by the rebel alliance. We hope that they have learned some lessons and are ready to act in a decent way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Nick, but the long and short of it is, you are willing to accept Mr. Kabila as the leader of Zaire, a rebel leader who has taken - overthrown the government by force of arms?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Sid, that is not our choice here. The United States does not have a vote, last time I checked, in Zaire. We are not going to determine who winds up as the leader of Zaire. I don't know who it is going to be, who will emerge from a transitional period as the leader of Zaire after the era of Mobutuism has finally ended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is not for us to decide. But we have enough interest in Zaire, political and economic and historic and others, to assert a strong U.S.  presence throughout this period in our Embassy, and to assert a strong U.S.  interest in seeing Zaire get back on its feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We would like to see elections. We would like the see the people of Zaire be given a choice for once. They have never been given a choice in the history of the country as to who is going to lead them. We think that there ought to be a free and fair election, and the best person should win that election, obviously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We hope it is a democrat. We hope it is someone who will want to take Zaire to where South Africa is. That is a very tall test, but it is not one that is unachievable. It can be met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: But there are ways to express yourself other than at that ballot box, such as at the United Nations with sanctions, as you have done against Burma and Serbia and so forth. Apparently Kabila's activities have not met your threshold for distaste.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: How could we possibly vote for UN or international sanctions on a rebel movement that is in the bush? It is not yet a government. It doesn't have a track record as a government, and you are asking me to say the United States Government in July or August of 1997 will take the following measures.  I have never done that as spokesman. I'm not going to do it now. You are asking me to answer a question that is unanswerable -- what is going to happen in Kinshasa? We don't know. So what I prefer to do is tell you what we hope will happen, and it's a public encouragement to those leaders from the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: But there are sanctions on the Sprska Republic, which is not a nation. I mean, it's not unprecedented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: The Serbs - the Bosnian Serbs - have been for better or worse, and almost always worse, the governing authority of the poor people who have to live under its jurisdiction. They are - they have their hand out for international aid, and we've not given them most of that aid because of their reprehensible behavior. But they are a governing authority. The rebel alliance has been mostly concerned with military tactics in a guerrilla war.  It's not a governing authority that anybody - any political scientist - would recognize. Now, it may be in a week or two or three, or somebody else may constitute that. We'll have to wait and see what happens in the transition, who occupies the seat of power. We hope it's a democrat - somebody devoted to elections, to cooperation with other countries, to devote him or herself to the welfare of the people of Zaire, which has been pretty much ignored for a long time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: It does, in fact, govern about two-thirds of Zaire right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I think govern is probably too strong a word to use. I mean, it is a military force that occupies cities. I think it intends to turn itself into a governing force, but I'm not sure we give it that distinction yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Nick, would this government ask Mr. Kabila to have a cease-fire to stand in place while these negotiations, the second --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: -- second negotiations are made?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Yes, yes, that is our position/</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: That is your position?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: And you would, I presume, prefer if, in fact, he is going to take Kinshasa, he will walk in without bloodshed, rather than fight his way in; is that your preference?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: That's right. Bill, you've done it; you've summarized the entire conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Laughter.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now we can move on to a much more productive discussion. Bill, congratulations; it's good to see you back here. I'm so glad to be back in this briefing room, talking about all these issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Laughter.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I missed all of you during our trip to Guatemala and Mexico and Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Did Richardson or the U.S. - maybe I missed it - did they ask Kabila to avoid bloodshed if and when he gets into Kinshasa?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Absolutely.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We saw last week that Ethiopia, in the 1950s, edged ever closer to the United States. Now read on:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Future of Eritrea</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emperor Haile Sellassie's foreign policy, during the post-war years, was largely preoccupied with the future of the Italian colonies. This was a seemingly intractable question, which led to lengthy international discussions. The Ethiopian Government, for historical reasons, was particularly interested in the disposal of Eritrea. The colony, much of which prior to the late nineteenth century had formed part of Ethiopia, had been the base for two major invasions of the country, in 1895-6 and 1935-6.  Acquisition of Eritrea likewise offered access to the sea, for which Ethiopian rulers had long hankered.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The future of Eritrea first came to the fore during the 1941 Ethiopian Liberation Campaign when the British had promised the colony's inhabitants freedom from Italian rule. Later, in October 1944, British Foreign Secretary Eden had declared, in answer to a Parliamentary question by a Labour MP (drafted incidentally by my mother) that the Italian colonial empire in Africa was &quot;irretrievably lost&quot;. Italy in a Peace Treaty with the United Nations, signed in Paris on 10 February 1947, was accordingly made to surrender its colonies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disposal of these ex-colonies was to be the responsibility of the then four Great Powers, i.e. the Soviet Union, Great Britain, the United States, and France. The treaty laid down, however, that, if they failed to agree within a year, the matter would be transferred to the United Nations General Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Four Power and United Nations Commissions of Enquiry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Four Powers, as it turned out, did not agree. They despatched a joint Commission of Enquiry to the ex-Italian colonies in 1947. It found the Eritrean population divided into three main factions: pro-Ethiopian Unionists, for the most part Christians, who demanded &quot;reunion&quot; with Ethiopia; adherents of a Muslim League, strongly opposed to such union; and members of a Pro-Italia party, many of them Italian pensioners, who advocated the restoration of Italian rule. The commissioners, whose findings reflected the political biases of their respective governments, produced divided conclusions and recommendations. The question of the colony's future was then transferred to the United Nations, which, after inconclusive discussion, appointed a further commission of enquiry for Eritrea. Its members came from Burma, Guatemala, Norway, Pakistan, and South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opinion in the ex-colony had by then crystallised into two factions: the Unionists on the one side, and an Independence block, formed by a coalition of the Muslim League and pro-Italia party, on the other. The new commissioners, like their predecessors, came forward with different proposals.  Guatemala, representing the pro-Italian position, then held by the Latin American countries, and Pakistan, a strong protagonist of Islam, both favoured independence for the colony; Burma and South Africa, supported its federation with Ethiopia; and Norway, outright union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN General Assembly influenced by the proposals of the three latter powers, finally decided, at the end of 1950, that Eritrea should be federated with Ethiopia, under the Ethiopian Crown. The Assembly further laid down that it would appoint a Commissioner for Eritrea, and that an Eritrean Assembly would be democratically elected by the people. The first task of the latter body was to approve an Eritrean Constitution, to be drafted by the UN Commissioner in consultation with the then British administration of the territory as well as the Ethiopian Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Eritrean Assembly was duly elected, under UN auspices, and chose the Unionist leader, Tedla Bairu, as the territory's Chief Executive. This seemed, to many observers, to give the Federation a stamp of popular approval. The Eritrean Constitution was likewise drafted, and approved, in 1952. The text of the constitution was, not surprisingly, considerably more democratic than Ethiopia's old 1931 Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relations with Italy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Italian Peace Treaty of 1947, which explicitly applied to the period as from Mussolini's invasion of the country, on 3 October 1935, also included articles of direct relevance to Ethiopia. Provision was thus made for Italy to return all loot taken from Ethiopia. Most of the loot was eventually returned. At least three gold crowns, which had been in Mussolini's personal possession at Dongo at the time of his attempted escape to Switzerland, in April 1944, however, mysteriously disappeared, and were not returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite many Ethiopian attempts to secure its restoration a twenty-four metre high fourth century stone obelisk, looted from the ancient Ethiopian city of Aksum, and placed by Mussolini in front of the Ministry of Italian Africa building (later the UN Food and Agriculture building) was similarly not repatriated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">War Reparations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The treaty also provided for Italy to pay Ethiopia up to 25 million US dollars as war reparations. These were largely spent in the erection, in the next few years, of a hydro-electric plant at Koka, south-east of the capital, a cotton factory at Bahr Dar, by Lake Tana, and several small ships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">War Crimes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The treaty likewise provided for the trial of Italians guilty of war crimes in Ethiopia, and for the return of historic and other articles looted from the country. Attempts by the Ethiopian Government to prosecute Badoglio, Graziani and others whom it accused of having committed war crimes were, however, in one way or other frustrated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cordial, and Friendly Relations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cordial diplomatic relations between the two countries were nonetheless eventually re-established in 1956. Despite much wrangling over the implementation of the Peace Treaty, particularly in the matter of loot, and memories of fascist atrocities, the Italians, by the mid-1950s, constituted perhaps Ethiopia's most popular foreign community.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The Ethiopian Agency for the Administration of Rental Houses (AARH), threatened that unless fifteen African embassies settle their rent arrears, over 19.4 million Ethiopian Birr, it will be forced to take strong action. It will severe power, water, phone services and later terminate their rent contact without prior notification.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency was not willing to specify the exact deadline for the termination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency said Gabon owed 2,896,056 birr, Sudan 2,211,913 birr, and Niger 204,094 birr. It said tanzania, Equatorial Guinea, Congo, and Sierra Leone each owed between 1 million birr and 1.9 million birr. Other African Embassies included Mali, Uganda, Chad, Mozambique, Burundi and Zaire, the agency said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Ato Mekwanent Ayechew, head of the registration and contact main section of foreign national tenants ,even after the publication Tof the rental arrears and the call for due payments, the responses from the said embassies were almost negligible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tanzanian embassy was the only one to have automatically taken some action towards the settlement of its rents due. Embassies of Sudan, Sierra Leone, Burundi, and Uganda are the other embassies initiating some measures to settle the rental arrears on monthly basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Mekownent said that the embassies of Gabon and Zaire have continued to be silent on the issue. He added that &quot; it is unfortunate that rich countries like Gabon and Sierra Leone expect a poor country like Ethiopia to give services without due payment for the services rendered.&quot; He reconfirmed that the embassies and the Ethiopian government have &quot;a tenant-landlord relationship,&quot; and unless they settle their long-standing arrears, the agency will be forced to take strong measures for such a &quot;cumulative problem&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - According to the economic service of the French embassy in Ethiopia, a change in the nature of trade between Ethiopia and France is gaining foothold . A trade suplus was recorded again in 1996, this time of 206 million birr.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to this, Franco-Ethiopian trade saw a confirmed increase of French exports over the past three years and a change in the nature of the trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For last year, exports of food products represented only 2 percent of French sales as compared with 54 percent in 1994. Exports of agricultural produce declined from 119 million birr in 1995 to 13 million birr in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, it was said, exports of industrial products saw a jump of 39 percent, moving up from 201 million birr to 279 million birr, and last year represented 86 percent of France's overall sales to Ethiopia. The latest figures also added that exports of professional capital goods registered an increase of 79 percent to reach a total of 128 million birr (40 percent of the total export to Ethiopia).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France is also faring well in our neighbouring country, Eritrea. France's exports last year exploded eightfold to hit 101 million birr, but Eritrean export trade with France managed a week 4.5 million birr, according to latest data. The largest part of French exports (62 percent) was food products.  Apart from a small amount of consumer goods (3 percent), the remainder of France's exports was made up of industrial goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eritreans seem to be importing televisions in huge quantity as the figures show that 90 percent of professional equipment consisted mostly of domestic television equipment worth 27 million birr manufactured by the French group Thomson.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - In Ethiopia , despite satisfactory main season cereal output in 1996/1997, large numbers of people are suffering severe food shortage due to failure of secondary season crop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Particularly in the pastoral southern regions of the country a food emergency has been declared , says a statment released by FAO.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the positive side, Ethiopia gathered last December a record wheat crop of 2 million tons. The main season course grains crop reached a record level and the aggregate 1996/1997 aggregate output, including the belg crop, is forecast at 9,4 million tons. However, following the failure of the &quot;short rains&quot;, poor crops were gathered and hence in southern marginal areas the second crop was sharply reduced. However , imports into the country is forecast to decline by 600,000 tons, reflecting an improved domestic production in Ethiopia. Ethiopia and other low-income food-deficit countries would receive about 5.9 million tons in 1996/1997, representing about 10 percent of their forecast cereal import needs as compared with 15 percent in 1992/1993, added the statement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The most significant cultural trait in ethnocentrism is language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every ethnic group in Ethiopia would like its language or dialect to be widely spoken in the country. Some members of the Oromo elite argue that Oromiffa (Oromigna is sometimes fround upon for being Amharicized) should be the national or official language of Ethiopia, invoking the statistical fact of their being the majority in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, the Amharas would like Amharic to continue its dominance and its status as the Ethiopian lingua franca. One of the very first actions taken by the Eritrean government upon secession from Ethiopia was to declare Tigrigna to be the official language of the Eritrean state. Similarly, the present Ethiopian government has allowed its ethnicity-based regions to use their dominant languages as official media of communication in their respective administrations. Hence, Oromiffa is the official working language in Oromia and Tigrigna in Tigray. Also, the Latin script is being used for Oromiffa instead of the Geez script, apparently to burge the Oromo language of any associations with Semitic linguistic features.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no doubt that language is a powerful and all-pervasive embodiment of one's ethnic affiliation and identity. In extreme ethnocentrism, the position of &quot;my tribe, my language, right or wrong&quot; is taken, often being translated into a program of political exclusiveness in the form of demands for sovereignty. In this vein, the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) has made it quite clear that its ultimate objective is a free Oromia. Similar demands have been voiced by the Ogaden Liberation Front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But why have the Tigrayans (i.e. the people living in Tigray) not yet seceded from the Ethiopian union although they now have the military clout to do so? why has Eritrea not broken her close economic ties (witness the use of the Birr as legal tender there) with Ethiopia? This gives a clue that there is a more powerful counterforce to the desire for statehood based on ethnicity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This counterforce, one can safely assume, is what we may call the economic factor. The desire for ethnicity- based statehood cannot be realized unless it is supported by an adequate existing or potential economic base. It is no coincidence that it is mainly the ethnic groups in Ethiopia who think and believe that they have the required real or potential economic resources to form separate states that are demanding sovereignty. By contrast, it is those ethnic groups who are not so sure of their economic viability that strongly advocate the preservation of Ethiopian Unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Eritrean elite believes that it is only a matter of time before the putatively vast oil reserves along the shores of the Red Sea make Eritrean the petro-dollar envy of the Horn of Africa; the Oromo elite knows that the so-called Oromia is the agricultural heartland of Ethiopia, apart from possessing substantial mineral potentialities; the Ogaden has for a long time been thought of as the potential economic redeemer of Ethiopia on account of its assumed vast natural gas and oil reserves (witness the Kalub natural gas project).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juxtapose the Amharas, Tigrayans and ethnic groups of southern Ethiopia with the above-cited ethnic group. The Amharas feel they have played a big role in the construction of Ethiopia and are closely attached to Ethiopian unity other than for economic reasons. Further, although they could be reasonably self-sufficient in food, they feel that they would retrogress to a rather primitive economic level if Ethiopia were to disintegrate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The loss of shares in foreign exchange and potential mineral resources would be unacceptable to this large ethnic group; on the other hand in present-day Ethiopian politics, the Tigrayans seem to be playing a rather confusing role. They occupy a territory in the country where the birthplace of historic Ethiopia is found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This same territory is also known for the paucity of its real economic resources, apart from the fact that it has been prone to frequent and often disastrous droughts. Yet many members of the Tigrayan elite appear to support the present government's political programme of ethic self-determination up to and including secession as enshrined in its constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many believe that this is largely a result of the influence exerted by the seceded Eritreans who, as is well-known, are their fellow ethnics. The southern region of Ethiopia is rich in agricultural and mineral (gold) resources, but it is also the region where practically all the ethnic groups of Ethiopia are found. Although several autonomous communities and at least one independent kingdom have existed in this region in the distant past, ethnic diversity more or less precludes aspirations for outright sovereignty under contemporary circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we can tentatively infer from the above discussion is that, although there seems to be an almost innate tendency to opt for ethnicity-based sovereignty, this is strongly counterbalanced by economic considerations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hence, the Tigrayans have not left the union although they could jolly well do that; the seceded Eritreans are still maintaining close economic ties with Ethiopia; ethnic diversity in Southern Ethiopia is so great that population and economic considerations seem to favour the preservation of Ethiopian unity - in other words, an option to form a separate ethnic state would in most cases mean a frivolous micro-state practically incapable of standing on its own feet!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As pointed out above, some members of the Oromo and Ogaden (Somalia) elites would certainly like to apply the constitutional right to secede, but since common ethnic claims on the real and potential resources of the regions which purportedly belong to them are so great, it is well nigh impossible to realize that aspiration in a hurry! Put simply, common ethnic economic interests are still holding the country together and perhaps the ultimate proof of this is that even the Tigrayans, who on paper assert the right to self determination up to secession and who have the military might to implement it, pay homage to these economic imperatives!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If economic interests thus take precedence over ethnic exclusiveness, political programmes and actions based on them should logically reflect that precedence, not otherwise. Our common ethnic interests can be realized only through the preservation of Ethiopian unity which is in essence an embodiment of those common economic and other interests. It now remains for us to highlight formally why the preservation of Ethiopian unity must take precedence over narrow ethnic political aspirations. Some of the reasons and justifications have already been intimated above, but they could be itemized more specifically as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- not all the regions of the country are equally endowed with real and potential natural resources, implying strong inter-ethnic bonds and interdependencies in sharing the country's resources as a whole;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- a large land mass and population imply more diversified resource endowments and more room for specialization and therefore greater opportunities for enhancing exports from which to earn foreign exchange without which economic modernization's practically impossible;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- a large internal market affords better opportunities for realizing economies of scale and therefore for more efficiency in resource utilization;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- similarly, a wide domestic market offers greater opportunities for greater specialization and exchange of goods and services, with positive implications for the quality of life;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- the fact of Ethiopia having already existed for a long time as a single country</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- broad similarities in culture and language</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- better defence against potential threats from larger countries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- a bigger voice in international forums</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the preservation of Ethiopian unity is thus important for our economic and non-economic common interests, it then becomes a matter of mutually compromising on our ethnic aspirations in order to promote this higher goal.  As language is an all-important expression of ethnicity, a breakthrough in this respect could represent a significant step forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The premise here is that the preservation of Ethiopian unity immediately demands an indigenous common language for inter-ethnic communication in the short and medium term, it is impossible to use a foreign language such as English as a working language because of its limited extent even in urban areas. Of the indigenous languages, Amharic is the most commonly used in urban areas where inter-ethnic mingling is most pronounced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over 70 percent of the urban population in Ethiopia speaks Amharic at home.  On the other hand, the extent of use of Oromiffa, Amharic's closest rival, and Amharic in rural areas is about equal. Hence, the compromise solution here would be to mutually agree to make Amharic the working language in urban areas and by implication the working language of the nation. There will, of course, be no restrictions whatsoever in the use of other indigenous languages in unofficial, interpersonal communication, be it in urban or rural areas. As a component of the compromise solution, the following would need to be agreed upon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- the medium of school interaction in any particular administrative unit shall be in the dominant language spoken in that particular administrative unit;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- all the major indigenous languages shall be taught at school from elementary up to high secondary levels in such a way that students gain proficiency in at least one indigenous language other than their mother indigenous language;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- all major indigenous languages may be studied at university level on the basis of student preferences for scholarly purposes;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- as English is likely to remain the major world language for a long time to come, proficiency in this international language should be given high priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, it is a compromise solution. By this solution, we would continue to have an indigenous national working language, namely Amharic. In an administrative unit where, say, 80 percent of the population speaks Amharic, school instruction would be in Amharic and not in Oromiffa simply because the town happens to be located in Oromia; all the major indigenous languages would be taught at school in such a way that students will be proficient in at least one indigenous language other than their own mother tongue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This would imply that an Amhara student could be fluent in Oromiffa by the time he or she completes 12th grade, thus being in a very strong position to appreciate both cultures as reflected in the two major indigenous languages; inter-ethnic marriages and other forms of social mingling would be greatly buttressed by such mutual appreciation of cultures. If such is going to be the outcome, there would be very little point in maintaining the present ethnicity-based regionalization, which, as has been correctly pointed out by many scholars, represents a path of ethnic exclusiveness which in is undermining Ethiopian unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">America is not only rich but great because it is big. Europe is uniting so that it may be great as well as rich. Ethiopia, though still poor and weak, must learn from the experiences of these rich and great world powers. Let us try to solve the language problem and maintain and preserve Ethiopian unity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - It is by now well-known that high office rents are a major constraint on private domestic investment. The manifest cause of the skyrocketing rents is, as anybody with only a nodding acquaintance with economics would readily guess, the shortage of office space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This in turn is caused by the relatively very small number of new buildings and houses being constructed. How come? In the Ethiopian development context, putting up a house or a building has practically and always been a passionately pursued investment venture. In the scheme of things related to investment, our feudal background has always given pride of place, particularly among traditional folks, to owning a piece of land and building a house on it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is as it should be for at least four reasons: first in Ethiopian culture, owning a piece of land and a house is equivalent to being somebody or to socially coming of age; second, although it is not economically speaking, necessary always true, land and houses are thought to be unfailingly appreciating assets and therefore the safest types of investment an Ethiopian could possibly make; third, barring destruction by volcanic eruptions, lightning and fire, the average probability of occurrence of which is extremely low especially with proprietor care, it follows as a corollary of the second traditional perception about real estate in general that the stream of rental incomes from such, an investment are the safest and the longest-running; fourth, there is no need for overheand or variable costs (apart from maintenance cost) or for complicated daily, monthly or annual accounting work (it is all simple: collect the rent and maintain the house).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why then the housing shortage? It used to be said, &quot;any fool can build a house, rent it out and become a rentier&quot;. This was the case during the days of Emperor Haile Selassie. The &quot;house to let&quot; signs were to be seen everywhere in town, in Addis Ababa and other town and cities. Without exaggeration, an individual could in those days move house at least three times in a single day!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Educated persons thought it more fashionable and more difficult to invest in a new car, which was more expensive than building a &quot;chika&quot; (mud) house on 300 square meters of land on the outskirts of Addis, which could be bought for less than fifty cents per square meter despite the fact that most of the land was occupied by only a fraction of the population!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That urban land and house prices should in the long run tend to move upwards is almost a matter of common sense, given the fixity of the supply of land and the increasingly burgeoning human population, be it urban or rural.  But land and house prices such as those we have been witnessing lately can hardly be a manifestation of this natural, moderate long- term upward movement of nominal values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How do you explain a land lease (not purchase mind you!) fee of 10 million birr for no more than 2000 meters of land in Addis? How would you account for the price of a hovel on 250 square meters of land that borders on the ludicrous sum of 400,000 birr?!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, above all, how do you explain an astronomical rent hike of 30,000 percent (&quot;Trade and Development&quot;, Amharic, Meskerem 1989E.C.) by an organisation none other than the government itself and of 6000 percent by that most unworldly of Ethiopian institutions, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church?! Of what use is it to reduce customs, business income, sales and excise taxes by a few percentages each if all the reductions are to be completely nullified by unbearably exorbitant rent hikes?!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A proud Ethiopian lady in Addis who was operating a bar in an apartment shop room the ownership of which reverted to the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and which therefore became subject to the recent rent increases imposed by the Church's property managers said : &quot; If those who preach against avarice can suddenly become so grasping, it sure is time for me to leave before they impound my bar furniture and equipment for rent arrears!&quot;. She kept her word and left before the new rent for the first month fell due!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A woman who, against all the heavy odds facing women in this country, had managed to put up her own business and helped create employment for a few of her compatriots, was thus hounded out of her small- scale investment by a rent increase which easily beats the record for any one-time price increase anywhere in the world outside Ethiopia, in which country, however, the record is surpassed by several rent increases imposed by the government!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a time when the business community should be actively encouraged by a government whose declared economic objective is the promotion of a market- based national economy, how is it that rents are being increased in such a way as to virtually drive that business community out of business?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will not be long before nearly every major section of the Ethiopian business community is adversely affected by exorbitant rent rises as the Rental Houses Administration is now said to be almost through with the preparatory phase of implementing a similarly high increase in its rent tariff, which it had already tried to put in practice before and failed but would now be likely to be fully implemented following the central government's unrestrained backing for the scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does it really make much sense to talk about a liberal investment code and tax reform to encourage private investment when all this admittedly positive effort is being badly vitiated by unprecedented rent increases? Why is it that there should be an unmistakably perverse problem in broad economic policy in this country? Why is the correct path generally forsaken in favour of the wrong one? Why is common sense abandoned in favour of obvious folly?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why indeed is every major piece of policy in reverse order and topsy-turvy?  Might there be some invisible Frankenstein which is whispering into our ears Orwellian types of inverted logic such as: black is white; truth is falsehood; right is wrong; common sense is nonsense; hate is love, etc?!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The root cause of the shortage of business premises and office space is the fact that land is not readily available for their construction, because land in this country is under the strict control of the state. As a result, whatever little office space is constructed by the private sector commands such high rents that only businesses with very high profit margins can bear them. Businesses with low, moderate and even reasonably high profit margins are automatically put off by the unbearably high house rents. So, it can safely be concluded that high house rents on the indirectly controlled domestic private housing market are a very significant deterrents to investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When this in fact is the case on the unfree private housing market, how is one to explain the move taken by the government and the property managers of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church to raise rents to levels that compete with rent trends on this unfree private housing market? At any rate, the effects of the steep rent increases have been devastating so far : rented business premises are being vacated for fear that unpayable rent arrears would accumulate; many businesses have been forcibly shut down on the pretext of being behind with rents; unable to make a final decision as to whether to leave or stay, thousands of business people are accumulating arrears which they may never be able to pay; some business people are timidly increasing the prices of their goods and services in the hope of offsetting at least partially the impact of the exorbitant rent increases, and this is already drawing bitter complaints from customers across the country; some business persons are eating into their reserves just to pay rent; some are so badly traumatized by the &quot;rent shock&quot; that they appear to have all but lost their motivation for doing business at all; as yet an unknown number of people have joined the ranks of the unemployed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What the members of the business community in particular and the public at large are now waiting to see is the sorts of people who are going to move into the business premises vacated by previous renters because of the exorbitant rent hikes! There have been quite a number of cases of much take- overs and many believe that this is perhaps the Achilles' heel of the business community that is badly undermining its efforts at forming a united front against the injustice that has been forced upon it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If such back-stabbing can somehow be averted, there is little doubt that it would constitute an added force to persuade the government to back down on its so far stubborn stance on the rent hikes. Collaborating with the government bureaucracy and the property managers of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church on the question of the rent hikes would be tantamount to a betrayal of the basic principles of a market-driven economy. The exorbitant rent increases are not even remotely determined by the free play of demand and supply. Rather, they are unambiguously the outcome of an unwarranted monopoly of the state on land and its well over 50 per cent ownership of the urban housing stock in the country! Capitulate to state monopoly power and the result is invariably state monopoly capitalism which in many respects is worse than communism!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a great pity that some positive steps taken to encourage private investment through tax and other investment incentives should now Tbe almost completely nullified by the &quot;rent shock&quot;! It all lends credence to the often echoed theory that economic reforms in Ethiopia are at best only cosmetic in nature and that a spanner is frequently thrown into them by a sometimes invisible, systemic and largely inexplicable perversity in economic policy in general!</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - In January when Taferi Agune went back to Switzerland where he had lived since the age of eight, and announced that he had formed a football club in his home country Ethiopia, some three thousand letters came flooding in, full of congratulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And not only did he receive tons of equipment in ten days, but the world football governing body, FIFA, and International Olympic Committee contacted him and asked that he come to Ethiopia to put together a project proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three weeks ago, Taferi arrived back in Addis and has now some two-hundred- fifty young players under his charge. Taferi, who has played for many Swiss clubs since 17, explained, &quot;The objective is to make the sport widely known throughout the country. These youngsters, aged between six and eighteen, should have the chance to grow up in the sport. Ours is a poor country and there is little opportunity open ,except maybe in sport. So we are trying to give the children a sort of balance in their life.&quot; So taking one of the six zones in the capital as a model, Taferi plans on finding ways of introducing an infrastructure much like that in Europe where recruitment of young talent is easier.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taferi, 29, joined his elder brothers in Switzerland when he was just eight.  His passion for football was complemented by good training and he was spotted by one of the Swiss professional clubs at the age of seventeen. &quot;I was given the choice between continuing my education or taking up football professionally,&quot; he recalls, adding ,&quot;it did not take me a second to make up my mind.&quot; For the next seven years Taferi made his way from the junior league to play--mostly in the number 7 jersey-- in such teams as Vevey Sport, Montreux Sport, Old Boys, and CS Chnois. When he turned twenty-five, Taferi suffered a knee injury and was forced on the bench for one year. &quot;I had time to think,&quot; he said, &quot;I began to ask myself how many years I had left in the game; what I would do after I stopped playing. &quot; His reflections led to him taking up his studies once more and go to university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Understandably, the first year was tough and there were many instances when he was ready to quit. &quot;I'm a fighter,&quot; Taferi exclaimed in his French accent, and true to his words he stayed on to graduate with a degree in economics and languages last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he came back to Ethiopia this time, sponsored by FIFA, Taferi was walking on air from all the encouragement he had received when he had first announced his plans. But he was quickly disillusioned--or woke up to reality as the case may be-- when upon arriving he realised that aid or no aid he was expected to pay duties for the football equipment he had brought in for the children. These are still held in customs and FIFA has decided not to send more until the issue has been cleared up, Taferi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There seems to be a lot of acceptance by the sport authorities that what Taferi is trying to do is the right thing. However, there always seems to be a 'but' in their every statement that slows down progress, he moaned. &quot;What I want now is for the sport federation and the government to be concerned with the problem and make facilities available. &quot; With the right infrastructure in place, those with high talent will be selected and pushed in the right direction. One thing is clear however, those who neglect their education will not be allowed to participate. &quot;We will not be responsible for them,&quot; Taferi stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though he has not been in the country long, his observation that professional football in this country still has a long way to go, is right on target. In the 1980's Taferi had come to Ethiopia to train for ten days with the national team. He recalls that he only found one player who looked good enough to play for a European club. The general atmosphere lacked what he described simply as &quot;professionalism&quot;. However, with his plan in action we may see a noticeable change for the better in some ten years time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Taferi is trying to accomplish goes beyond the realms of football. He is just an example of the many Ethiopians who, if given the right encouragement from the concerned authorities, would only be too willing to return home and make a difference. Going abroad seems to be the ultimate goal of many Ethiopians, but Taferi noted, that would not be a wise move. &quot;When I first arrived in Switzerland I was unique, and every kid wanted to be my friend. Now in Europe, there is racism--you saw how the French are treating the emigrants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many people are fooled by the act that Ethiopians coming from abroad put on, he said. &quot;Some clean toilets there,&quot; he remarked,&quot; and come here to act as ministers.&quot; Visiting Ethiopia once in a while is no longer enough for Taferi Agune. If things work out for him, he wants to reside here permanently and for a change he says, &quot;I will go back to visit my friends in Switzerland.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Fire broke out, this time in what is known as Africa's largest market place, 'Merkato', destroying some 33 shops and many stalls in the early evening Sunday 4 May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fire is presumed to have started out in a tea shop and there were no human casualties, according to ENA.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">It took around three hours for fire fighters to put out the flames--with the proximity of the stalls hampering their progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the second fire to occur in a market place in exactly two weeks.  The previous one at 'Aware', some 200 meters from the old palace, destroyed around 44 shops and much property. Police have yet to reveal the cause of the fires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An earlier fire at yet another market place in the city, 'Cherkos' in February caused the destruction of 990 shops and some residential houses.  According to police report, the fire was deliberately started by a man whose brother had lost his shop following regulation prohibiting sub-leasing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The 23rd meeting of the ECA Conference of Ministers responsible for economic and social development and planning was held from May 5 to May 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theme of the conference was &quot;Promoting trade and investment to promote Africa's development.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Important personalities have addressed the conference.  The conference has also addressed the role of information and communications technologies in promoting trade and investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This sort of conference has been held in the past and it will be held in the future. Discussion alone will not solve Africa's problems. At times there are not even genuine discussions that touch on the core of the problems. How can one trade if there is no law and order? Who will dare to invest when there is civil war? Who will dare to invest where there is no infrastructure?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There should be an open and genuine discussion and a mechanism to implement the result of the discussion with designated time. Mr. K.Y. Amoako, United Nations Under-Secretary General and Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) was one of the high-placed Africans who made an opening remark. He said that some African countries have posted a growth rate of more than 4% in 1996 and many countries have reduced their current and fiscal deficits. But he was quick to add &quot;...in spite of the recovery and positive changes taking place in this continent, social indicators remain below those of other regions.&quot; Africa is behind in all respects. We need to wake up. Our leaders need to wake up. As Mr. Amoako said, &quot;Unless our countries gear up for the increased competition in the integrated global market, they will not share in the gains.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Ethiopian Human Rights Council (EHRCO) has issued a report denouncing the recent bomb explosions in a hotel, restaurant and a department store in Addis Ababa killing one person and injuring a total of seventy-five.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EHRCO stated that it was regrettable that the assailant had chosen places where innocent people were the victims. Speaking against last year's bombing concentrating mainly on government hotels, EHRCO also had strong words for the government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Such acts of terrorism generally occur when it becomes impossible to hold a roundtable dialogue, when some individuals and groups which claim an interest in national affairs are denied a forum for imparting their views and aspirations to the public and hence feel marginalized, and when they lose hope in peaceful struggle,&quot; the report said. It went on to add, &quot;In our country, there is no tradition of open discussion and dialogue between opposition groups and the government. What one repeatedly hears from those who hold the highest public office is : let he who wants to raise arms in rebellion dare to do so! &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EHRCO goes on to explain that the ruling EPRDF &quot;controls all the major aspects of political and public life (and) the opposition groups with a vested interest in Ethiopian affairs have been marginalised from the political scene.&quot; The activities of some opposition groups have been restricted to the capital and &quot;those that set up branch offices outside Addis Ababa in 1992 and 1993 have been driven out of the provinces, and they can not operate even in Addis Ababa without the permission of the EPRDF.&quot; Civil organisations such as the Ethiopian Teachers Association (whose president is currently in jail charged with forming and heading an underground organisation) and the Confederation of Ethiopian Trade Unions have been &quot; prevented from conducting its normal function by uncalled for government intervention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EHRCO also made mention of the case of the university students who were &quot; detained and tortured&quot; without being charged for holding a demonstration that was alleged by the authorities to be &quot;illegal&quot;. The students were within their right to stage the demonstration and had done all that was required of them by informing the appropriate government office about the event 48 hours before hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ethnic politics which are nurtured and promoted by the EPRDF also appears to be creating xenophobia,&quot; according to the report , HRCO said, &quot; the material and moral support directly or indirectly extended by the West to EPRDF's ethnic politics is giving rise to a dangerous attitude in which the West are summarily regarded as being responsible for the problems prevailing in Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;EHRCO is opposed to acts of violence perpetrated by any party,&quot; the report said, remarking that, &quot;it is with sadness that we recall that the Derg's 'Red Terror' was vindictive response to such acts of violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Lawyers of Former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence Tamrat Layne (charged with three counts of abuse of power) said Wednesday 7 May that the five-man panel at the Federal Supreme Court had no jurisdiction over the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said if his case was seen by the present court, it would violate his constitutional right to appeal. They also pointed out that the articles, enabling cases of high government officials accused of abuse of power to be first seen by the Federal Supreme Court, did not apply to their client. At the time the first and third counts of abuse of power were supposed to have taken place, Tamrat was an official of the Transitional Government and not the Ethiopian Federal Democratic Republic--for whom the law applies, the lawyers stated.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were none of the smiles and laughter between the accused--one government employee and the rest business people-as was the case during the first two appearances in court. Tamrat's downcast face was mirrored by the other seven in the dock as they solemnly listened to the 15 - page document put together by Tamrat's three lawyers, Seleshi Kessela, Kaleayu Mehari, and Assefa Negussie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accusing the prosecution of not making its evidence available , the defence asked the court to order the evidence to be availed to them. The document also noted that the prosecution's charges were not clear and lacked details, in some cases did not make the connection with the crime apparent, did not distinguish between the World Bank and IMF, and furthermore did not prove how the formation of Ramis company was illegal-- or even Tamrat's association to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyers also raised objections to the use of the special penal code in trying the case. They explained that the code was formulated under the previous government to dispense inhumane punishment on people, and had no place in the present society. And going back to their first point, they stated that the panel had no jurisdiction to see the case of individuals charged under the said code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Arega Asmamaw, lawyer for Ato Gulilat Tilahun,former head of the PM's office during Tamrat's premiership at the time of the transitional government, also questioned the court's jurisdiction on the grounds that Gulilat was not a government official, and moreover should have the right to appeal. The lawyer added that not only were the charges not clear, (and the special penal code should not be used for reasons mentioned above) but that it did not have access to the prosecution's evidence. It was also noted that the accused should not be charged as an accomplice since he was only following orders and the prosecution had not shown whether he had acted willingly to benefit himself or a third party. It would be in the interest of the said individual if his case were to be seen in separation from that of the former deputy prime minister's, the lawyer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court also heard the replies to the charges from the lawyers of Shadia N. Kassim and her son Wassim A. Kassim. Jointly represented by Yoseph G/Egzihaber and Abera Tasew, they also objected to their case being seen by the court as it would deny them the right to appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial was adjourned until 30 May when the prosecution is expected to answer to the objections raised by the defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court said it will rule at a later date on the case of Hussien A.  Kassim, who had disappeared since investigations into the affair began.  Police revealed that they have now discovered that the accused had left for Dubai in October last year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The radio quoted Ethiopian News Agency that said Assefa Maru was wanted by the police in connection with the alleged formation of the armed underground organisation that ETA's president, Dr. Taye Woldesemayat, is under arrest for.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The radio also said that police had captured others also in connection with the same case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to EHRCO sources, their office was contacted yesterday and told to collect the body of Assefa Maru, who, they were told, had died in a car accident. When they went to Black Lion hospital they saw two bullet holes in his body. Police had surrounded his home and ETA office yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The Thirty Second Session of the Economic Commission for Africa and the Twenty Third Meeting of the Conference of Ministers Responsible for Economic and Social Development were held here in Addis Ababa between May 5 and 8, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The major theme of the Conference was &quot;Accelerating Trade and Investments in Africa&quot; Coupled with the role which effective information and communication systems could play in furthering those two important aspects of economic activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his opening speech, H.E. Dr. Kassu Yilala, Deputy Prime Minister of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This forum and its annual meetings have always provided you with the occasion to review the economic and social conditions in our continent and to deliberate on ways and means of addressing the economic and social challenges that Africa has faced. It is in this same spirit that this session will afford you a unique opportunity to exchange views on some of the critical economic, trade, investment, information and other related issues of our continent, with a view to taking joint and collective steps to ensure for Africa sustainable growth and development. No doubt, you could not have chosen a better theme for this session than 'Accelerated Trade and Investment'. Except in few instances, the general economic situation in Africa in terms of GDP growth has, by and large, been improving since 1994.  These developments underscore the fact that despite difficulties here and there in our continent, which usually draw the disproportionate attention of the mass media, Africa is emphatically not a place of gloom and doom&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several other distinguished personalities also spoke at the conference or sent messages, including H.E. Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the UN, Dr.  K.Y Amoako, Executive Secretary of the ECA, H.E. Ambassador Vijay S.Makhan, Assistant Secretary General of the OAU and H.E Mr. Ferhat Lounes, Vice- President of the ADB.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his message to the conference, the Secretary General of the UN made the following statements:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The African continent today is at a crossroads. Prospects for development appear in many ways brighter than they have been for some time. Evidence includes rising economic growth rates, an increasingly strong commitment to economic reforms, the consolidation of democratic rule in many countries, and a growing dynamism of the private sector and of civil society .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, there remain many conflicts and a great deal of strife in the continent, which continue to generate emergencies of tragic proportions.  The Economic Commission for Africa has been and will continue to be an important agent in promoting Africa's development. In this regard, I trust that your deliberations at this session will take the process of renewal of the Commission a step further by focusing on various institutional reforms, including the review of the intergovernmental machinery . The theme of your conference this year - Accelerating Trade ad Investment in Africa' is important and timely. African countries must strive for greater participation in world commerce and finance. Finding ways to increasing Africa's share of exports and to enhance its access to private capital follows is vital to sustaining the economic recovery of the region&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his part, the Executive Secretary of the ECA made the following remarks:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, the three principles that have guided the reform and renewal of the Commission are strategic focus, cost effectiveness and strategic partnerships. The first two considerations have been fully reflected in the managerial and organizational reforms undertaken in the past one year. Today, I can confirm that the organizational restructuring of the secretariat has been completed. The revised work programme for 1997 and the 1998-1999 work programme embodies fully several of the new modalities for programme implementation. For example, there will be fewer reports, fewer but more productive meetings, improved quality for documents, periodic survey to measure client satisfaction, enhanced media and communications strategy for ECA's work and more use of policy forums&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerning trade and investment issues, H.E. Dr. Amoako made the following observations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; We are witnessing an Africa which is emerging as a more dynamic continent, replete with trade and investment possibilities. A new generation of reform- minded leaders is in charge in many capitals . Governments are creating environments which allow investors and entrepreneurs to flourish. There has been a distinct attitude change which embraces rather than shuns business and private sector development. Any credible strategy to accelerate the development of Africa must include the promotion of trade and investment among its key elements. A policy framework to promote increased investment in Africa must address issues relating to the political climate; a conducive economic policy framework; increased public savings and investment; increased private savings; attracting foreign investment; and enhanced regional cooperation and integration&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stalemates made by H.E. Ambassador Vijay S.Makhan shed light on the broad policy measures that African governments should pursue in order to enhance trade and investment as may be appreciated from the following excerpt:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In considering the conditions and prospects for accelerating trade and investment in Africa, attention should focus on such important parameters as sound policy and institutional frameworks, in particular the regulatory environment, the efficiency of the banking systems, the monetary regime, the nature of incentive packages and the physical infrastructure. Trade acceleration, in particular the promotion of new and fast moving export products, is very important. The package of measures and actions called for in this regard should be directed at the supply side, in terms of enhancing Africa's productive capacity in respect of these new export product lines as well as Africa's competitiveness. As regards investment, it is my view that two actions are urgent: one, to mobilize domestic resources and make it possible for the return to our continent of flight capital, and two, to create the proper environment to attact FDI.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coming as they do from some of the most experienced African personalities of the day, all the statements excerpted above are without a doubt highly enlightening . But could some mechanism be worked out through which the collective will of the African economic leadership may be made to bear on individual African countries? Concerning the theme of this year's conference, namely &quot;Accelerating Trade and Investment&quot; could , for example, the ECA prepare a report ranking African countries on the basis of their respective performances in the area of accelerating trade and investment using some selected yardsticks such as the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- the number of non-traditional exports emerging as major foreign exchange earners;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- the number of days required to obtain an export trade license;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- the average level of export taxation, if any;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- special measures taken to promote exports such as the establishment of export processing zones;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- the average level of customs and other import taxation;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- the absolute and relative amounts of FDI inflows;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- the number of days required to obtain an investment license;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- the number of days necessary to get water, telephone and electricity connections to an investment project etc..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a ranking report would then be distributed at high -level conferences and meetings of African countries whereby delegates may be encouraged to learn from each other's experiences. High-ranking performers should be praised for their accomplishments and low-performens should be encouraged to emulate the examples of the former. Particular trade and investment constraints in each low-performing country should be highlighted with a view to recommending corrective policy measures. Call it what you will, but such a positively competitive spirit in policy-making may well help render the ECA an effective forum for bringing about desirable economic and social reforms on the African continent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - The All Liberia Students Union has appealed to ECOWAS and its allies to postpone the May 30 elections for three months to give time for adequate preparations for a free, fair and transparent polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president of the union, Joseph Wehjla, Friday told a press conference in Accra that while ALSU lauds the unrelenting efforts of ECOWAS and other facilitators to bring peace to Liberia, it has realised that the proper infrastructure and the necessary conditions for a lasting peace are still not in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These range from security arrangements, voluntary repatriation and participation of refugees, civic education, voters registration and intensive but orderly campaigning by the political parties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wehjla said these are necessary for the electorate to participate massively in the polls and bring the war-torn country back to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the recent discovery of a huge cache of arms in Nimba county &quot;put question marks on the security situation&quot; in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We wish to recommend that the elections be postponed for a period of three months from May 30, 1997 to August 30, 1997 by which time we envisage that these critical issues would be addressed to bring real democracy to our beloved country,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three-month postponement of the polls, he added, would also serve as a platform for preaching peace and reconciliation since the more than seven- year war had created apathy and enmity among Liberians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALSU, whose membership represents about 50 percent of Liberian refugees in Ghana, called on the international community to support and supplement the &quot; tireless efforts&quot; of ECOWAS with resources to ensure successful elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said there are about 700,000 Liberian refugees in five West African countries and there is the need to allocate maximum time to voluntary repatriation of as many as would want to return home to take part in the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hold the view that with the exclusion of such a sizeable number of Liberians from the voting process, the result of the elections would not reflect a true representation of the choice of the people,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MATOBO, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The local chapter of the International Council of Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), predominantly a group of archaeologists, has embarked on a mammoth task of identifying, preserving, restoring and reclaiming thousands of historical sites scattered around Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council also has plans to run a massive awareness campaign against vandalism of tourist sites and commercialisation of sacred spiritual places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ultimate objective is to combine traditional and professional preservation of the sites as the two are not in conflict, but complementary,&quot; said Tafirenyika Masona, ICOMOS chairman .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This may also lead to some of them being recommended for listing on world heritage sites like Khami and Great Zimbabwe ruins, Victoria falls and Mana pools.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Zimbabwe boasts of a rich historical heritage, some of the sites' locations are still not known as they were either swallowed up by development projects or lie hidden in communal and commercial farming and mining areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 18-member ICOMOS is already processing guidelines for developers and planners to ensure that where it involves the turning of the earth an assessment study becomes imperative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are sites that are destroyed in the process of development or out of sheer ignorance or mischief,&quot; Masona said. &quot;There are also some monuments which have not been accorded the protected status under the Museums Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe has the challenging task of identifying all the sites, particularly those with traditional and spiritual significance and accurately re-write some of their history free of colonial bias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joseph Muringaniza of the National Museums and Monuments says no one knows the exact number of sites, but they could run into thousands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Matabeleland alone we have over 5,000 sites, while in the Matopos national parks we have over 3,000,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But hundreds of san rock paintings in Matopos and Silozwane, now commercial sites, have been vandalised with Ndebele king Mzilikazi's grave lying almost abandoned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Njelele rain making shrine remains a curious tourist site that has progressively lost its spiritual awe and significance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ntabazikamambo, another 19th century rain making shrine in the Midlands province, is now out of bounds to locals as it has become part of a commercial farming concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mt Muoz in Manicaland, where locals appeased spirits, was vandalised. The hot springs in the same province were diverted by a commercial farmer into warm bath water for a holiday resort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The construction of Zhovhe dam in Matabeleland South province destroyed the ancient stone walls, while in the Zambezi valley baobab trees and pools sacred to the Nambya people have been disregarded by tourists and rafters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are just a few of the historical sites which have been victims of 100 years of colonial neglect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This in sharp contrast to the preserved symbols of subjugation like the grave in Matopos of empire builder Cecil John Rhodes and other monuments erected throughout the country in recognition of colonial conquest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now ICOMOS is of the opinion that though the national museums and monuments has done a commendable job in preserving Zimbabwe's historical sites, since the country gained independence 17 years ago, its capacity has been limited by lack of funds and its archaeological thrust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is being identified and preserved as of value by museums is not of value to the people,&quot; said an ICOMOS member who requested anonymity. &quot;One wonders whether we are out of touch with the spiritual world. We are not protecting Zimbabwe's living traditions. Njelele is an obvious example.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the sacred Njelele Shrine has not been officially commercialised as a tour attraction, it appears to have been progressively disregarded because of its spiritual outlook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has now become a playground for tourists who leave all manner of paraphernalia, including foreign coins as souvenirs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no accessible road leading to the shrine except a treacherous strip, while three supposed custodians of the sites are locked in a bitter wrangle over its control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no substantive documented post-independence research of the shrine except one said to have been carried out in the 1960s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even the so-called custodians are desecrating the place by introducing white values, yet they should have maintained the traditional ones,&quot; one archaeologist said. &quot;One of the custodians explains the history of the shrine in English and even wears Western attire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite these setbacks, Masona says the level of public appreciation of historical sites is gaining momentum. People from areas that are still highly spiritual have in the past helped identify some of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We used to give them a small reward and we are trying to revive it to make it more meaningful,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And added Muringaniza: &quot;We, as museums, have an obligation to support the revival of these traditional and spiritual values and practices as part of our heritage management.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - President Robert Mugabe on Saturday said the atrocities allegedly perpetrated by the army during anti-dissident operations in Matabeleland and the Midlands be regarded as a historical mistake which should never be repeated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent report by the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace and the Legal Resources Foundation detailed horror killings and rape of villagers in the two provinces by troops of the North Korean trained 5th brigade in their operations in the 1980s.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe has taken time to respond to the allegations but warned that such reports threatened the national unity of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we dig up past history, we wreak the survival of the nation and can tear our people apart into tribes and villagism will prevail,&quot; he said at the burial of veteran politician Stephen vuma at the National Heroes Acre in Harare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said what had happened should not be repeated and &quot;...we must never oppress man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe has in the past said there was no need to apologise for the killings and sufferings as it was a war situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A catholic himself, Mugabe warned people to be wary of detractors to unity, who disguised themselves in religious garb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giving himself as an example of true reconciliation and forgiveness, he said people should not go by happenings of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we go by the past, what cause would compel us to keep Ian Smith (former Rhodesian prime minister), perhaps I would be first to cut his throat,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Another high-level corruption bombshell is set to explode over Mpumalanga's already embattled MEC for safety and security, Steve Mabona, following allegations that he irregularly used State funds to pay for private air charters, regular personal flights to Gauteng and accommodation expenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Sunday Times investigation has discovered that Mabona has run up a R47 900 account with just one air charter company in Nelspruit which on at least one occasion provided a fixed wing plane for a private trip after the funeral of a government colleague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabona, who lives in Houghton, almost 400km away from his office in Nelspruit, uses a State sponsored house in Nelspruit during the week. The house's rent is not deducted from his salary or subsistence allowance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabona earlier told Sunday Times that he had decided to live in Gauteng because it was too expensive to buy a house in Nelspruit and also because &quot; the schools are better in Johannesburg&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabona is not the only senior safety &amp; security official who currently lives in a State sponsored house or townhouse. At least seven other directors or deputy directors, including the financial director, all live in a townhouse complex in Nelspruit's poshest suburb, Steiltes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complex was especially built for the department, which signed a long lease on its six units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Department head, Advocate Stanley Soko, confirmed on Saturday that there were &quot;problems&quot; with the accommodation arrangements and said that the rentals, ranging between R2200 and R2600 per month, would have to be deducted off official's salaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know it's wrong, but the situation already existed when I joined the department and as most of the department's senior staff come from KwaNdebele, 300km away, it is not easy to just end it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soko also confirmed that he was aware of extensive repairs to a luxury rented car which was crashed by a woman unconnected to the department in Durban some time ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He denied, however, that the woman was the girlfriend of a senior official and that the vehicle had been hired at State expense for her exclusive use.  He was unsure if the government had paid for the R80 000 damages.  &quot;I have a statement saying that the vehicle was hired by Captain Fanie Malapo from Mabona's special investigation unit and that the woman who crashed it was a witness for their license scam investigation,&quot; said Soko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Malapo was in the car but for disguise purposes had to act as a passenger.  I am still going to take the matter up with the State Attorney.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He denied all knowledge of a similar incident in Johannesburg this earlier year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soko insisted that while he knew that Mabona flew up to Gauteng to go home roughly once a week on scheduled SAA Airlink flights, he had no idea how much this cost the department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also denied all knowledge of the various private charters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soko's acting head, Rina Charles, was given the financial files detailing both these and the various accommodation accounts on Friday but consistently refused to divulge the costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles also refused to give finance deputy director, Mr Ngomo, permission to release the details, &quot;until the matter has been discussed departmentally&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabona was unfortunately unavailable for comment and is still reportedly recovering from a stress related ailment in Johannesburg. He will, however, testify before the Moldenhauer Commission on Wednesday regarding his part in the irregular issue of a learners and drivers license to Parliamentary deputy speaker, Baleka Mbete-Kgositsile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soko, who was also booked off sick last week due to a back injury, will testify before the commission on Tuesday or Thursday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Text of questions and answers by State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns on Zaire at the Department's May 9 briefing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Have you confirmation that the rebel alliance in Zaire will not go to a second meeting with the Mobutu Government?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: No, we don't have the confirmation of that, Jim. As you know, the South Africans are trying to set up a meeting for next Tuesday or Wednesday, again on board a South African naval vessel. We heard today earlier, there was a couple of reports that there might even be an agreement for a meeting, but we can't confirm that for you.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What I can tell you is the following about Zaire. Our embassy reports that the situation in the capital, Kinshasa, is relatively calm. The town of Kenge, where there was fierce fighting yesterday is now in rebel hands. Fighting continues around Bukanza-Longo, which is a town west of Kenge. We have also seen reports that the alliance has taken the town of Bandundu, which is about 185 miles northeast of Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have strongly urged Mr. Kabila again today to negotiate a soft transfer of authority, rather than to take Kinshasa by force. We have also urged him to stop the rebel alliance military movement in its tracks while the negotiations with President Mobutu are proceeding. We think that would be a good-faith gesture on the part of Mr. Kabila that he wants a soft landing, that he wants a peaceful, rather than a violent, transfer of authority. We are very strongly urging the rebel alliance to stop its military movement forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, President Mobutu, in the Libreville communique, declared that he would not be a candidate for the presidency of Zaire if national elections are organized. We hope very much that elections can be organized in this transition period because that is the best way to identify the future leadership of a country. In fact, it's the only way to do that democratically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We would be very pleased to help to prepare those elections, to give any possible assistance we could to that. So our watchword is, Kabila should stop the military offensive in order to allow room for negotiations. There ought to be a peaceful transfer of authority. There ought to be elections that allow the people of Zaire to decide their future, and there ought to be a continuing attention to the plight of the thousands of refugees in Kisangani.  The United Nations is doing a powerful, superb job in trying to bring them out to safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: All right, it may be that Mr. Kabila is saying different things to different people. But reports that we see from there says that he's not planning to go to a second meeting. But you don't think that's a final.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I don't believe we have a conclusive answer on the question of who will go to meetings and whether, in fact, the meeting will take place.  Our own view is, it's just logical. It makes common sense, and it's the best way forward Mobutu and Kabila to meet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Has there been a response to the U.S. message to Mr. Kabila?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I don't believe Mr. Kabila has made a commitment. He certainly did not to Ambassador Richardson, with whom I spoke this morning, about stopping the rebel military offensive. Of course, that is disappointing.  There is nothing to be gained by killing people on the way to Kinshasa. It seems to us that this transition is going to take place. It seems inevitable.  Therefore, why can't it be done peacefully, rather than militarily, rather than by violence?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Another subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I think we want to stay on Zaire just for a minute. Yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Do you know where President Mobutu is? You know, the wires are reporting that he was going to return today to Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Well, last I checked, which was about an hour ago, he was in Libreville, in Gabon. He had not yet left. We don't know whether or not President Mobutu is going to return to Kinshasa, whether he will stay in Libreville, whether he will go someplace else. We are watching that very anxiously, as are all of you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Has the embassy given you - in Kinshasa - given you any indication of what the response might be in the streets of Kinshasa where President Mobutu to return?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: No, I have not seen any account, any predictions from our embassy in Kinshasa about that. David.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Can I raise a consular case with you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Still on Zaire. Carole, yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: I'm just - have you heard this delegation of 30 investors led by an American company? It's called American Mineral Fields that arrived in Lubumbashi today to discuss investment prospects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Yes, we know that there is a group of American companies in Lubumbashi trying to make contact with the rebel alliance. We think this is most unwise. There is always a time for profits to be made. We think it is important for companies to keep their employees out of harm's way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lubumbashi is a dangerous place. There is a civil war underway in that part of Zaire. Why in the world companies would want to risk their own people for short-term profits is beyond me. We strongly advise American citizens to stay out of Zaire. It's a dangerous place. We urge Americans who are living in Zaire to leave the country immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can get out by boat to Brazzaville. There are still flights out of the country to Europe and other parts of Africa. That is our advice to American citizens and the American business community. Zaire is a strategically important country. It has got enormous economic wealth, mineral wealth. But we think American companies ought to exercise some good common sense here and keep their people out of harm's way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Along those lines, Nick. James Wolfensohn of the World Bank said that he would be sending a delegation in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Well, that is different. That is entirely different. The World Bank has an obligation to help countries in transition, to help countries with severe economic problems. I know the World Bank will make the best possible decision about when to send a delegation in. They certainly would not send a delegation into the middle of fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We do have enormous respect for the people who work for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Committee for the Red Cross who have inserted themselves in the middle of the fighting. But that is because their job is to help people in need. But people who are simply looking for profits, they ought to exercise some good judgment here.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Text of questions and answers by State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns on Zaire at the Department's briefing May 9.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Do you have anything to say about Qadafi's trip to --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Oh, boy, where do I start?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(Laughter.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where do I start on Qadafi's trip? Yes, I do have a lot to say about Qadafi's cavorting with various dictators in Africa. He's a dictator himself.  Let me tell you what we know about this. There are very reliable reports that a fleet of aircraft flew from Tripoli to Niamey, the capital of Niger.  Colonel Qadafi was one of the passengers. He got off and had some meetings with Nigerian government officials in Niger, in Niamey. He then left Niamey and apparently now is in Lagos. He's cavorting with General Abacha in Lagos.  One wonders what they talk about.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we are concerned about is the United Nations sanctions on Libya, which absolutely prohibit Libyan registered aircraft from flying anywhere in the world. Now, what we are doing now today, we've asked our embassy in Niamey, we've asked our embassy in Lagos to go to both of those governments and to inquire about the facts of this case. Believe me, we will be very disappointed with both of those governments if in fact they aided and abetted the Libyan dictator to fly - in violation of the UN sanctions - to both of those countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are asking the Nigerian Government in Lagos to detain the aircraft on the ground in Lagos. Now, it probably stands to reason, if they let the aircraft come in, they're probably going to let the aircraft leave. What we'll do when we establish the facts in these cases - we want to go to both these governments and give them the opportunity to tell us if they've been involved. We will go to the United Nations, to the UN Security Council and to the Sanctions Committee, and we will request strong action by the United Nations in the form of a condemnation of the Libyan government actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will have a very definite effect, and negative effect on Mr. Qadafi.  The effect will be this - from time to time, we have to review the sanctions on Libya. There are some countries who argue that the sanctions ought to be lifted. Well, the next time that review comes around and we can establish the facts in this case, there ought to be a very strong decision by the Sanctions Committee and by the Security Council that there has been a significant violation. That ought to defeat any attempt to allow Libya to have these sanctions lifted. The sanctions were put in place because we believe that two Libyan agents placed a bomb on board Pan Am 103 in December 1988 and killed over 269 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We haven't forgotten those people. American foreign service officers were on that flight, innocent people were on that flight. We owe it to their families to try to bring these two terrorists to justice either in the United Kingdom where the plane crashed or in the United States, where these people can get a fair trial, but where we believe justice will be served. So Mr.  Qadafi may think he's got some - that he's pulled a fast one on the West and on the United Nations, on the world community. He may delight in flying from one country to another. But this will simply reinforce the commitment of the United States and the international community to keep these sanctions in place on him. He will not be able to fly easily beyond his immediate region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Nick, what about Niger and Nigeria? Is there any penalty for them cooperating with the violation of UN sanctions against Libya?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Well, we are going to, as I said, our ambassadors in Niger and Nigeria are going to have some very frank discussions with both governments today and tomorrow. If we establish the facts that these governments were involved in violating the UN sanctions, obviously it's going to have a negative impact on our relations with both countries. It's hard for me to imagine a more negative relationship with Nigeria than we already have, but perhaps we'll be able to take that relationship to lower depths. I don't know.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - A total of 4437 cholera cases with 146 deaths have been reported since the end of November 1996 to 7 May 1997. The real number of cases is believed to be higher because of the difficulty of data collection.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weekly reports have been made by NGOs working in the country as well as by the local authorities where available. A total of over 2000 cases with 74 deaths has been recorded in the epidemic in Mogadishu, but it appears that it has now passed its peak, although high levels are still being reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intensified efforts are still necessary to guarantee sufficient supplies to all NGOs involved and continued vigilance is needed, especially in those areas not yet affected by this epidemic. WHO is supporting the NGO's and local authorities by providing technical support and supplies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Konare is the candidate of the Alliance for the Democracy in Mali, ADEMA, which was the parliamentary majority party in the previous legislature while Diaby is standing for the Party for Unity, Development and Progress.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Bamako, the capital, security forces maintained a vigilant eye as voters strolled to polling stations in small groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking after he had cast his ballot, Konare reiterated that if he gets re- elected, he would extend a hand to the grouping of opposition parties which boycotted the polls and threatened not to recognise the victor from the poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition parties had called for the cancellation of Sunday's presidential polls and threatened to use all means, including civil disobedience, to prevent its smooth running.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition even filed a petition with the Constitutional Court. The petition was rejected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the court accepted the other opposition demand to nullify the results of the April 13 parliamentary elections, which were characterised by numerous irregularities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition parties also demanded the disbanding of the Independent National Electoral Commission, the resignation of the cabinet and the creation of an interim administration to oversee the holding of fresh polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government rejected the demands, saying they could lead to a constitutional vacuum capable of undermining the country's democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Konare won the first multiparty presidential electionin 1992, which were held after the fall of Gen. Moussa Traore.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (PANA) - More than four million Burkinabe voters are casting ballots Sunday to choose 111 members of parliament from 569 aspirants presented by 13 political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The voting, which started at 6.00 GMT and ends at 18.00 GMT, is taking place in 6,517 polling station in all of Burkina Faso's 45 electoral provinces of at least 50,000 people each.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A low turnout was observed early Sunday morning but observers expected the situation would improve in the course of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attention of most political observers in Ouagadouo is focused on the level of participation, hoping that it would not be as low as in 1992, when the turnout was less than 40 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parliamentary election was preceded by a 21-day low-key campaign, as most political parties lacked the funds to wage a more vigourous battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, it is only the Congress for Democracy and Progress (CDP), the former parliamentary majority party, which has been able to field candidates in all the 45 provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CDP's only potential opponents are the African Democratic Rally (RDA) of Gerard Kango Ouedraogo, which has candidates in 25 provinces, the Party for Democracy and Progress (PDP) of Prof. Joseph Ki-Zerbo, which is fielding contenders in 35 provinces and the Alliance for Democracy and Federation (ADC) of Herman Yameogo which is present in 33 provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Burkina electoral commission has said that the legislative elections are expected to cost 3,346, 209.630 F CFA ( 1USD=500 F CFA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burkina Faso is expected to hold presidential elections in 1998 during which the incumbent, Capt. Blaise Compaore, is expected to seek a new mandate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compaore came to power on Oct. 15.1987 following the assassination of the former President, Capt. Thomas Sankara. He stood for the 1992 multiparty polls and won.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRIPOLI, Libya (PANA) - Libyan leader Moammar Kadhafi returned to Tripoli Saturday evening, abruptly ending an African tour which was expected to take him to South africa, after his lightining visit in Niger and Nigeria Thursday and Friday, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kadhafi had annonced after new Islamic calendar year prayer sermons in Niamey on Thursday that he intended to travel to South Africa and several other African states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The prayers we are going to perform here in Niamey, at Kano (northern Nigeria) and other African regions are aimed at showing theworld thepower of Islam and to mobilise the Islamic masses to counter the conspirators seeking to destroy Islam,&quot; he had declared.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While preaching in Niamey and Kano, Kadhafi launched a scathing attack against the anti-Islamic policy of the United States in particular and the west in general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No official explanation has been given in Tripoli as to why the Libyan leader cut short his African tour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the United States had asked the United Nations Security Council to denounce what it termed as Col. Kadhafi's breach of the air embargo which was imposed against Tripoli on April 15, 1992 under the Lockerbie affair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The air embargo is part of sanctions which were imposed after tripoli refused to surrender for trial in Britain or America two of its nationals who were suspected to have planted a bomb that belw up an American plane, killing 270 passengers over the Scotish town of Lockerbie in December 1988.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libya said it was prepared to let the suspects appear for trial in a neutral court presided over by a Scotish judge or at the International Court of Justice in the Hague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kadhafi flight to Niamey and Kano became the second violation of the UN embargo. In June 1996, Kadhafi flew aboard a Libyan Airlines plane to Cairo, to attend an Arab League summit in the Egyptian capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Libyan leader's mobilisation call on muslims against the United States anti-Islamic policies and Washington's moves to stiffen anti-Libya sanctions within the UN are clear signs that the tug-of- war between Tripoli and Washington is getting tougher.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA, Uganda (PANA) - Uganda and Sudan have agreed to exchange captives, including 114 Sudanese soldiers and abducted Ugandan children, according to the Kampala-published Sunday Vision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state-owned Sunday paper reported that the pledge is contained in a resolution which was adopted on Saturday at the end of a meeting held in Kenya by the Ugandan, President Yoweri Museveni and his Sudanese counterpart, Gen. Omar el Bashir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper said the meeting in Eldoret, Eastern Kenya, was convened by President Daniel arap Moi. Museveni travelled to Kenya straight from Rwanda where he had gone on a one day working visit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a concluding communique, the two leaders also asked Moi, who is chairman of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) to urgently call a meeting to find a peaceful solution to the civil war in southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sunday Vision reported that the two leaders also agreed to bring rebel leader John Garang into the peace process, initiated by the signing of a peace agreement of April 22.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper wrote that the talks were held behind closed doors with Moi first meeting Museveni and Bashir separately. He later left them to hold face to face talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also present in the background was former Sudanese rebel leader Dr Riek Machar, who told journalists at the airport he had travelled to Kenya on his own initiative to beef up the peace process initiated by President Moi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Machar was this week in Uganda on a controversial visit where his statements on the peace process in Sudan were refuted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Kampala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda and Sudan have traded accusations of harbouring and assisting each others' rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda recently paraded 114 Sudanese troops who were captured at the common border allegedly on a special assignment to invade Uganda and prepare ground for a new offensive by the anti-Kampala Lord's Resistance Army of Joseph Kony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan in turn also paraded two Uganda army officers of junior rank who were captured inside Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kampala authorities later confirmed those were Ugandan soldiers who had been on an intelligence gathering operation in Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan is also suspected to be holding hundreds of Ugandan children, including those abducted from Aboke Secondary School in Gulu by Kony's rebels combating Museveni'sadministration in the north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Eldoret meeting is the latest in a series of diplomatic efforts to mediate between the two countries. Previous ones have included initiatives by the Presidents of Malawi, Libya and Iran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over a month ago, Uganda's Foreign Minister Eriya Kategaya and Minister of State for Defence Amama Mbabazi met with Sudanese Gen Omar Bashir, just after the start of the latest offensive by the SPLA.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) - President Omar el Bashir of Sudan has expressed optimism that relations between his country and Uganda were entering a new phase of normalisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President said this in Khartoum Saturday, on his return from Eldoret, Kenya, where he held a lengthy meeting with his Ugandan conterpart, Yoweri Museveni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, the fact that the meeting took place, in spite of the state of war the two countries were locked in recently, was an indication the two states were now entering a new phase in their relations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Relations between our two countries will witness a tangible improvement after the summit conference that we are to hold in two weeks,&quot; Gen. Bashir said on arrival here late Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he hoped his meeting with Museveni, held under the auspices of Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, would help change the negative stance of other neighbouring states towards the Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan currently has strained relations with Egypt, Ethiopia, Eritrea and , until saturday, Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khartoum and Kampala have mutually accused each other of supporting each other's rebel groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Sudan claimed it had captured a number of Ugandan tanks and held many Ugandan army troops captives in Southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sudan national television showed two of the Ugandan captives confessing to the violation of territorial integrity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Ugandan side had also showed a number of Sudanese soldiers who had allegedly made an incursion into its northern territory. Each side denied the accusations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in a joint declaration issued in Eldoret at the end of Saturday's meeting, the two sides have agreed to exchange prisoners of war, students and other captives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Museveni, a close ally of Col. John Garang, leader of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), has reportedly promised to bring Garang to join the peace agreement signed between Khartoum and some six minor southern Sudanese rebel factions on April 22 this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Sudanese foreign minister, Ali Osman Mohamed Taha, has told the official daily, al Sudan al-Hadeith, that he hopes the Bashir-Museveni meeting would pave the way for a wider regional and international recognition of the Khartoum peace treaty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western countries, including the United States, have praised the content of the peace agreement but advised that the main rebel faction, the SPLA and other dissident groups, should be part of the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SPLA launched the ongoing civil war in 1983 to oppose the introduction of Islamic laws (sharia) and the domination of the mainly non-islamic south by the Arab north.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) is in the process of establishing an early warning sytem to enable it to check on potential conflict areas and facilitate expeditious intervention by the continental body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system is being established in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where the OAU already has a central organ for the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts in Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alert system will draw information from a number of focal points comprising member states, sub-regional groupings, United Nations and its agencies, the media and individuals who are renowned for their eminence in conflict resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will be soliciting information from them and we will analyse it, summarise it and make recommendations for the secretary-general to consider carrying out an early political action,&quot; said Cris Bakwesegha, who heads the OAU's conflict management division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, the entry point rule often caused delays, resulting in intervention being made when a crisis had already deteriorated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All we can do is to appeal to member states to understand that the sooner the OAU is allowed into a theatre of conflict the better because the crisis can be defused quickly,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bakwesegha said that in addition, the diplomatic approach would continue, despite its limitations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a communique issued in Abuja on Saturday at the end of a two-day visit by the two heads of state, the three leaders urged Zairean to cooperate with peace efforts being made bythe United Nations, the Oranization of African Unity and regional leaders to find a negotiated settlement to the seven month old war in their central African nation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accra - Most children in Africa's urban cities would not live to realise their innate qualities by the year 2025 if the current trend of high population growth continues, experts warned during an African mayors meeting in Ghana recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is in view of the lack of adequate resources to match up to the trend as well as lack of clear policy options and commitment on the part of African mayors for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incidentally, the growth trend is occurring at a time when most African urban areas are experiencing serious deterioration, resulting in a reduction in living standards and worsening access to infrastructure, basic services, education and health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This mix of rapidly increasing needs with fewer resources has meant a worsening of the conditions of children in urban areas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a bid to overcome this trend, mayors from 56 African cities and other stakeholders in child development and survival met in the Ghanaian capital, Accra from March 11 to 13 to explore policy options and develop recommendations for African mayors to commit themselves to the plight of the African urban poor child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Accra Metropolitan Authority (AMA) which organised the workshop in collaboration with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (UNCHS) says it was compelled to share ideas with fellow African governance institutions and stakeholders in child development and survival in view of the precarious situation in Accra and other emerging cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Mr. Nat Nuno-Amarteifio, Mayor of Accra; &quot;We have a lot of street children all over the place, we believe it is high time we did something about their plight and we can only do this if we learn from and share experiences with our fellow African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, Accra today boasts of a high concentration of street children and hawkers eking out a living in very difficult circumstances, with some barely able to get anything to survive on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the disadvantaged children have been caught in the trap of vices in their desperate struggle to survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bemoaning the situation, Ghana's First Lady Nana Konadu Agyeman Rawlings notes that &quot;the family, a strong and functional unit which the child needs for security, guidance, social and emotional development, is now under attack.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ghanaian situation might not be an isolated one. All over Africa, the lack of appropriate responses to match up to the high incidence of population growth, has led to a situation where families are faced with a lot of unmet needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most cities of the continent have grown several fold over the last few decades and the implications have been obvious - lack of resources to match the growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Abidjan to Dar-es-Salaam, Cairo to Cape Town, urban slums are mushrooming across the region with little or no investment for infrastructure and social services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Togo, a study of urban investment levels in the four five-year plans spanning the period from 1966 to 1985 showed a steady reduction from 17.9 per cent of total investment in the first plan, to 16.7 per cent in the second plan, to 10.6 per cent in the third plan and 6 per cent in the fourth plan, says a 1996 UNCHS report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disinvestment in urban sanitation, a major service that controls and prevents the spread of severe gastrointestinal diseases, has also suffered a 10 per cent coverage reduction in urban areas, from 65 per cent in 1990 to 55 per cent in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lack of clean water, safe sanitation and waste management is expressed in recurrent epidemics of cholera and recurrent episodes of diarrhoea, spread of dengue fever and malaria, and increases in respiratory diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These diseases are alarming indicators of a degrading urban environment with a direct and severe impact on the health of children and women living in urban slums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reduction of basic services and infrastructure coupled with increasing urban poverty as a result of declining formal employment, has contributed to a growing informal sector and increased urban discontent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is needed to counter this unacceptable urban reality is a commitment by Africa's mayors, local authorities and local governance institutions, in partnership with civil society, to identify and undertake sustainable development models, participants at the Accra conference indicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The models, they argued, must strive to realise the rights codified in the Convention on the Rights of the Child by ensuring the survival, protection, development and well-being of African children and converting African cities into caring (child-friendly) cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also noted that governance institutions, from large metropolis to small towns, are usually ill-prepared to face the alarming situation of the urban poor and therefore recommended that scarce resources must be managed more efficiently and targeted to meet the most vulnerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kwame Ampadu, a participant, believes that a tremendous effort with concrete capital investment is needed to change the current situation in Africa's urban settlements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a first step, he thinks support must be given to the staff of municipal or city council institutions for their training and to improve their capacity to address the needs of the poor and children living in their cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The participants were of the view that support of community activities through non-governmental organizations should be encouraged in order to foster civil society's full participation. They called for an integrated approach to community development with the active participation of all stakeholders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An important component to these efforts is to build up the local capacity of community leaders and local authorities to bolster project durability and replicability on a larger scale while children should also be placed at the centre of the planning and development equation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But above all, African cities should take an active role in responding to the challenges facing humanity. They should fight strongly against poverty, ignorance, insecurity, environmental degradation, and promote and strengthen the rights and well-being of their people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps if they are able to do these, the future would after all not be so bleak for the African urban poor child say in the next decade or so?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Like a judge delivering his ruling, Dr. Henry Fung, the head of the bone marrow department at the Vancouver General Hospital in Canada told the minister's wife; &quot;After the first round of chemotherapy pending the transplant, your husband will have a 30 per cent chance of survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After the second, he will have only a 15 per cent chance.  Please arrange to take him home to Kenya immediately to avoid unnecessary expenses, for he will surely die within the next six months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then followed the most crucial question; &quot;Do you still want him to go through the chemotherapy and transplant?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking at her husband, lying in the hospital bed obviously in excruciating pain, Nancy Odwaro had only one wish, that this man would get better. An emphatic &quot;Yes!&quot; was the answer she had to the doctors last question. She believed he would survive no matter how slim the chances.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hosea Odwaro was born in Tigoi of the present Vihiga District, Western Kenya, in 1950. He recalls having been a strong, ebullient young man who revelled bullying his peers.  He attended the local primary school for his early education but his dreams of completing high school were cut short when his father, then working in the coastal town of Mombasa, lost his job and thus could not afford school fees for his children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Hosea and his two younger brothers thought their father's loss of job was the worst stroke of luck coming their way, they had quite some thinking to do when the parents moved to neighbouring Tanzania in search of greener pastures, leaving the three boys, including Zephaniah, the youngest who would later be his elder brother's saviour, to plod along with their aunt in Kisumu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Life became hell on earth as the elderly woman could not adequately cater for the boys, forcing them to do odd jobs, including hawking, to get even a morsel of food in the evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one day Hosea hit upon a brainwave. Ostensibly, he would go to Tanzania to persuade his parents to either come back or have the boys join them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He would visit a Sukuma magician for a good luck charm. The Sukuma of Tanzania are famous for their prowess in &quot;performing the impossible&quot;. Hosea wanted the charm for three reasons - protection against any evil, a love potion such that no lady would resist him, and a well-paying job to enable him fend for himself and the brothers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His mission accomplished in Sukumaland, Hosea returned to Kisumu to face the hostile world with greater confidence. In 1977 he completed his secondary education but before he could land his dream job, he had his first brush with death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sukuma charm had given him so much confidence that he was back to his bullying ways. One night, at a night club in the town, he picked a quarrel with some town toughs whose thorough roughings landed Hosea in hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This incident became a turning point in the young man's life. Lying in the hospital bed, it began to dawn on him that traditional charms were nothing against the earth's ills and what he actually needed was God's protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon his release from hospital, he quickly joined life ministry with the Christ Church of Kisumu, an extension of the Pentecostal Evangelistic Fellowship Africa (PEFA) of the United States. The church organized ministry courses for him in Nairobi, so that when the American missionaries left for home in 1986, he took over as the church's senior pastor. This was after he had been appointed the evangelism director when the church was established in Kisumu in 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1984, Pastor Odwaro decided that he could use some leave after working non-stop for about nine years. His bosses had no objection, suggesting that he take the deserved rest in Nairobi. But he rejected the offer, arguing that he knew he would be recalled every now and then in times of crisis. The destination had to be Canada where he would also pursue a degree course in theology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">September 1984 found Hosea at the Pacific Bible College in Surrey, British Columbia, determined to complete his studies.  But he began feeling ill. &quot;I began feeling what I believed then to be malaria symptoms,&quot; he told this writer in an interview in his office at the PEFA church compound in Kisumu recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A blood test at the college health clinic indicated nothing about malaria. Hosea had blood cancer, or leukaemia. &quot;Maybe it is not that serious after all,&quot; the pastor told this writer how he had consoled himself, as he tried to come to terms with the reality of the implications of the usually fatal disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To confirm the clinic's and his fears, Hosea was transferred to the Vancouver General Hospital where he was diagnosed as being an acute leukaemia case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His wife Norah travelled from Kenya to join her ailing husband and funds were raised for the intensive regimen of treatments that were to follow. However, Nancy did not panic.  Like the strong and dutiful woman that she was, she consulted with Hosea's friends at the college and elsewhere on the best way to raise the funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, as if by premonition, Hosea had started subscribing to a medical insurance scheme in Surrey. Together with the money raised from friends, the pastor was able to meet the cost of the chemotherapy and the transplant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After only three months of medical attention, including the chemotherapy, the bill had spiralled to 285,000 Canadian dollars (about 11 million Kenya shillings). This is not to mention the cost of the transplant and other related expenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the two rounds of chemotherapy, Hosea recalls; &quot;I had lost not only much weight but also all the hair on my head. My finger and toe nails were also gone. I could not talk or eat.  I was fed by an intravenous system. The light skin pigment had gone and the skin itself was peeling off in scales all over the body. Gone too way my memory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When she arrived from Kenya, Nancy had carried blood samples from Hosea's two brothers and his daughter. She had been instructed by his doctor to do this to see if any of the samples matched the patient's blood. It was the sample from Zephaniah, the younger brother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon Zephaniah joined his brother and sister-in-law to donate some bone marrow to try save his brother's life. Hosea now recalls how his family back home organised to raise his donor's ticket. They had to sell almost all the livestock and other property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a six-hour operation which involved removing two litres of marrow from young Zephaniah's bones and transplanting it into Hoseah's, the church minister's life had been saved. Full recovery followed in a matter of weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recalls Pastor Odwaro; &quot;Even the doctors were amazed at the results. I recovered so fast that on June 6,1995, I was discharged. The biopsy test showed that I had fully recovered although I reported to the hospital regularly after that for routine check-ups.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What proved to all and sundry, including himself, was that Hosea was able to do the equivalent of two semesters' work in one to make up for lost time. He accomplished this feat so successfully that he was positive the memory the chemotherapy had taken away was fully back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When this writer recently attended Sunday worship at Christ Church of Kisumu, it so happened that Pastor Hosea Odwaro was the day's preacher. He had just arrived from Canada. The sermon was based on the subject, &quot;Which Report Should I Believe?&quot; and referred to the Old Testament book of Isaiah 53:1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the moving sermon, the pastor recounted in English, and translated into Kiswahili, how God had led him to believe the report of hope and not that of despair and despondency.  &quot;My doctor of great learning and experience gave me the report of despair and hopelessness, and God gave me that of hope and encouragement,&quot; he told the congregation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He recounted how, as he lay in his hospital bed in Vancouver, God had spoken to him, saying; &quot;I am raising you up to be a living testimony. As I was with Paul, so shall I be with you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pastor said, &quot;after those words, the excruciating pain all over my body disappeared even before the transplant. How great faith is!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - A recent publication, The Bible in African Christianity, attempts to examine the historical aspects of the Bible among African Christians and its current ministry among the faithful on the continent while it suggesting various ways the church could bring the Bible message closer to African realities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Published in 1997 by Acton Publishers, Nairobi (Kenya), the 209-page volume contains 12 theological essays by a cross- section of theologians drawn from Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria and one Canadian. It is edited by two renowned Kenyan and Uganda scholars, Dr. (Mrs) Hannah Kinoti and Prof.  John Waliggo respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their essay, Biblical Hermeneutics in African Instituted Churches (AICs), Kenyan theologians Dr. Zablon Nthamburi and Dr. Douglas Waruta discuss out the Bible's contribution to African literacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot over-estimate the importance of the Bible to the African communities. In most cases, portions of the Bible became the first readers for literacy classes. Those who went to school found that they had to begin reading biblical passages as they became literate as there were no other books available in their mother tongue,&quot; the authors say.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many instances, ability to read, particularly the Gospel, was a requirement for baptism in many churches.  Through the translated scriptures, people conceived that the God who spoke in the Christian scriptures was the same God whom they knew from their forefathers. They could identify with such a God and felt at home with the written word of God, the theologians explain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nthamburi and Waruta point out that many of the locally founded churches use vernacular Bibles, which play a very significant role. The translation of the Bible into African languages became a medium through which biblical hermeneutics/interpretation was promulgated by indigenous churches, the authors stress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his essay, Bible and Catechism in Uganda, Dr. Waliggo cautions that when discussing the Bible in African Christianity, it is necessary to bring out the distinction between Catholic and Protestant traditions and approaches, and evaluate the type of Christian life each has produced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is from such critical studies that the contribution of both the Bible-centred and catechism-centred Christian approaches can truly emerge, he says. The two traditions are not mutually exclusive but they can enrich each other, he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Catholic clergyman says the language used in both Bible translations and catechisms must make the message clear rather than obscure, otherwise, more proliferation of new African Christian churches or communities will increase. Both traditions need to be more ecumenical in interpretation of the Christian message, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenyan Catholic nun Anne Nasimiyu-Wasike, writing on Mary, The Pilgrim of Faith For African Women, challenges the African Christian woman to stop playing it safe and influence the world by affecting it with her dynamic response as Mary, the mother of Jesus did. It is also the responsibility of every African Christian woman to remain faithful to who she is as Mary did many centuries ago, Wasike says, adding, it is through Mary that God confided His divine plan for human destiny to the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canadian theologian Dr. Gosnel Yorke, who has taught religious studies in various parts of Africa says some attempts are being made to work with a hermeneutics of suspicion and liberation from within, with the hope that creative ways will be found to bring about reconciliation and fellowship between Black Christians and White Christians - since African Christians in the diaspora have always felt that unity (and not disunity) in the human community is what God in Christ not only desires but also deserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Discussing The Bible and the Black Diaspora Dr. Yorke cites Malawian Catholic Bishop Patrick Kalilombe as an example. Rt.  Rev. Dr. Patrick Kalilombe and others helped to establish a ecumenical centre for Black and White Christian partnership in Birmingham, England. The centre, is jointly sponsored by the Council of Churches for Britain and Ireland, the Selly Oak Colleges and the University of Birmingham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the name of the cross of Christ, the African Church is challenged to discard whatever is compromising the revolutionary message of the gospel. Uganda theologian Dr.  Peter Kanyandago, in an essay, The Cross and Suffering in the Bible and the African Experience, urges the church to operate a critique of her theology, her way of exercising power and pastoral practices. The biblical message is un-unequivocal, whatever is responsible for causing human suffering must be rejected, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The author also reminds that the church that she cannot be revolutionary without being truly African. Thus the need for a response that is grounded in the African cultural heritage and which takes into account the history and humanity of the African. Symbols which have no meaning for Africa would have to be replaced with meaningful and participatory ones, the Uganda theologian suggests. He adds that rehabilitating African symbols and the culture which carries and passes them on is a prerequisite for liberating the African from all that causes his/her suffering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzanian theologian Rev. Fr. Laurent Magessa notes it is precisely biblical interpretation informed by actual experiences of Africans in their socio-economic, political and religious environs what will move hermeneutics from its captivity of privatization. In other words, he adds, it will transform the exercise of interpretation away from the sphere of ideology towards the arena of truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this cannot be achieved if the people or the local community is not involved in the exercise, the Tanzanian theologian argues in his essay, From Privatized to Popular Biblical Hermeneutics in Africa. Somehow, the community itself and its struggles and its perception of the world must influence, if not determine, the orientation and the findings of biblical interpretations, he recommends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his essay, The Use of Biblical Critical Methods in Rooting the Scriptures in Africa, Ghanaian theologian Prof.  Emmanuel Obeng laments that a critical study of the Bible has not been encouraged in Africa. This, he says, is unlike in the early centuries of the Christian Church when Africa and North Africa were the centre of biblical scholarship. North African cities like Alexandria and Carthage became Christian centres known for their academic deliberations on the Bible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, North African personalities like Clement of Alexandria, Origen and Augustine have influenced Christian thought for centuries. Origan was the first Christian scholar to give serious attention to textual criticism, a tool which is still relevant to the study of the Bible today, Prof. Obeng notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ghanaian theologian suggests that the study of the Bible must be left to the theological schools and seminaries.  He decries &quot;Biblistists&quot; in Africa, who he notes have failed to make a lasting impact in biblical studies in Africa. Many have turned their attention to African Christian theology which has been the vogue in Africa for some years now, others trained in universities in America, Britain and other European countries, are still under the influence of Western scholarship such that they have not seriously reflected on how to make the knowledge acquired relevant to Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenyan theologian Nahashon Ndungu says although the Bible has been translated into many languages, it still portrays the Jewish world view and metaphors, some of which are not easy to conceptualize especially in the vernacular languages. This &quot;problem&quot; calls for African theologians who can write commentaries of the Bible and possibly translate them in the local languages, he proposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the theological disputes in the African Independent Churches which have led to several schisms in these churches could be minimized if the leaders had a proper understanding of the scriptures,&quot; the Kenyan scholar points out. And goes on to describe the Bible as a library from which people will find what they regard as relevant to their situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is in this respect that the Bible has been instrumental in shaping the African Independent Churches, he says. &quot;The leaders have selected the practices which they consider to be relevant to their social-cultural set-ups,&quot; Ndungu writes in his paper, The Bible in an African Independent Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian theologian Prof. Tuesday Adamo exploring the subject, Peace in the Old Testament and in the African Heritage, says in the African context, there is a social dimension of peace. Shalom is not simply the absence of war, it also means tolerance and respect for one another. This tolerance is an important aspect of shalom, rooted in the teaching of African traditional religion, the author explains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And religious intolerance, often heard in such statements as; &quot;My religion is the only right one/the best,&quot; has led to chaos, says Prof. Adamo. Such opinions have been the cause of barbaric inquisition in which many devotees have been murdered. He gives examples of crusades during the medieval period and explains that the war in northern Ireland and the early destruction of lives by religious fanatics in northern Nigeria are due to religious intolerance. Shalom, means tolerance in political, religious and all affairs, the Nigerian author explains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenyan theologian Dr. (Mrs) Hannah Kinoti notes the Bible has proved a strong symbol of hope and ultimate victory because it records the history of Israel, Jesus Christ and his mission to liberate, redeem and restore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Millions of peasants, she says in her essay; Well-Being in African Society and the Bible, read the Bible with the same interest as they listen to news of the daily happenings of a continent in travail. Their only cry is, &quot;How long, O Lord, how long?&quot;, (Rev.6:10).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Dr. Kinoti, the majority of African Christians find potent words in the Bible. These words, she explains, have come directly from God or from his appointed agents, including parents, prophets, priests, the apostles and others God has freely used. And the Bible also portrays a real world which in many aspects corresponds to the African world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his paper, The Bible and Ecumenism in African Christianity, Kenyan Prof. Jese Mugambi points out that all scriptural religions are held together by common scriptures.  He explains that Judaism is held together by the Torah, Islam by the Qur'an and Christianity by the Bible. And vedic religions are held together by the Vedas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But paradoxically, the scriptures which bind together the religions derived therein, are also a source of tension and division,&quot; argues Prof. Mugambi, saying that scriptural religions are torn apart by differences in interpretation of the same scriptures which are commonly believed to be the source of divine inspiration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Non-scriptural religions do not face the &quot;binding book&quot; problem. Prof. Mugambi says this is because their doctrinal teachings are fluid, flexible and spontaneous with a generally accepted world-view. It is normal, for example, to expect Africans in a particular ethnic community to differ on the doctrinal formulae of their cultural and religious heritage, he further says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking at The Bible as a Tool for Ecumenism, Kenyan theologian Dr. Mary Getui says for the Bible to serve as an effective tool for ecumenism, the greatest challenge is for individual believers to study the word themselves and find out what God has to say about their unique situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prayers become paramount, because it is the channel through which the believer communicates with God. It is the contribution and participation of each individual that can make ecumenism possible and sustainable, she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The thought provoking title is published under the African Christianity series, managed by the Ecumenical Colloquium of East African theologians, a consultative forum, instituted in 1987. The book sells at a cover price of Kshs.500 in East Africa and US$ 15.00 outside the region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kinshasa - The Zairean Red cross says 10 of its workers have been murdered in the town of Kenge as Special Presidential Guard (DPS) withdrew from the town, 200 kilometres east of Kinshasa in the face attacks by Laurent Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other unconfirmed reports said as many as 200 civilians have been killed in the battle for Kenge, among them an entire local church choir. Reports early last week said young men in Kinshasa, suspected to be supporters of ADFL had been abducted from their homes and have not been seen again. The abductions are reportedly the work of the DPS.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reported heavy fighting in Kenge appears to be taking on international dimensions with reports that the forces of Angola's Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) rebel movement were helping pro-Mobutu forces to stall or defeat attempts by the ADFL to enter Kinshasa without a fight.  The ADFL have swept Mobutu's forces from much of Zaire without serious fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, Angolan government troops - as well as &quot;Portuguese speaking conscripts - are reportedly helping the ADFL in the battle for Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers are worried by this specific development, charging that the UNITA and President Eduardo dos Santos' Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) forces have simply transplanted the Angola civil war into Zairean territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Moose, the United States Under Secretary of State for African Affairs was the first to sound the alarm in mid- April after intelligence sources informed Washington about the respective troop movements. Moose is concerned that the acrimony between UNITA and the government (MPLA) army, which had been substantially diminished by the recent peace accord in Angola could be rekindled in the Zaire fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile other observers say ailing President Mobutu who is on a two-day visit to Libreville, Gabon, to attend a hastily organized Franco-phone summit, is trying to get his best friends in the region to help him with forces to stop the rebel advance on the Zairean capital. Mobutu flew out on May 7 as some speculated that he may never return to Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers say since Mobutu's credibility remains very low, one strategy involves encouraging calls for Archbishop Laurent Mosengwo Pasinya, former President of the Transition Parliament, to offer his candidature leadership in any post- Mobutu scenario.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Leaders of South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) are to present a collective demand for amnesty before the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Nelson Mandela's ANC said in a statement on May 2 that it had decided to &quot;adopt the principle of a collective responsibility for all acts conducted within the broad parameters of ANC policy against the apartheid regime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement said the party will provide the TRC, set up to probe human rights abuses during the apartheid era, with a list of its senior officials and of operations carried between 1961 -- when it was decided to use violence as a mans of countering apartheid -- and 1994 when South Africa's first multi-party elections ended white minority rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki was expected to head the list which will hold some surprises, according to the statement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbeki would present the list before the Truth Commission next week, together with a report on the legitimacy of the armed struggled against the apartheid regime, various sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence Minister Joe Modise, who headed the armed wing of the ANC, said last year that he was ready to face his responsibilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In common with other South African political parties and movements, the ANC put forward its version of the facts to the TRC last August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frederik De Klerk's National Party, which was in power until 1994 has not opted for a collective admission of guilt, but has urged its members to individually accept blame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, former government officials have not rushed to come forward. Despite the overwhelming confessions of several former police and military officers, they have argued that they were not responsible for the atrocities committed and were deliberately misinformed by security services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Candidates hoping for amnesty, which the commission will grant in some circumstances to those who confess taking part in as yet unsolved crimes, have until May 10 to declare themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, former South African Defence Minister Magnus Malan has taken full responsibility for secret apartheid-era raids into neighbouring countries, but said they were all state-sanctioned and legal, and apologised for the acts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malan became the first senior military chief to apologise before South Africa's truth and reconciliation Commission for covert operations committed in defence of the now-defunct white minority regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soldiers under his command committed abuses that led to &quot;the deaths of innocent people&quot; as part of their &quot;duty&quot; to their political masters, Malan told the commission on May 7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former minister said the apartheid regime state security council, grouping the president, military officials and senior ministers, had authorised &quot;legal&quot; raids against anti-apartheid bases in neighbouring countries &quot;that caused much bloodshed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I authorised orders to cross-border operations, which led to the killings of innocent people,&quot; he said. &quot;I regret it, but unfortunately, this is the reality of war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malan, who was acquitted last year of charges of ordering the 1987 massacres of eight people in Kwa Zulu-Natal province, acknowledged that some soldiers' judgement had suffered &quot;in the heat of battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I take full moral responsibility (for) when members of the South African National Defence Force acted unlawfully, and I offer my unqualified apologies,&quot; Malan told the panel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malan, who served as Defence Minister during the 1980s, likened the role of the apartheid military to Umkhonto we Sizwe, the ANC's armed wing, which he said also committed abuses for their anti-apartheid cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The cruelty of man against man can often appear inexplicable and difficult to justify,&quot; Malan said, adding that all participants in historical conflicts had committed terrible acts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Successive white minority governments under the National Party led by Frederik De Klerk, should bear the blame for immoral,a yet &quot;lawful&quot; acts committed in defence of the state, Malan added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malan criticised the truth body for having &quot;no military experience,&quot; saying he hoped commission members would understand that any excesses committed by military personnel should be seen in the context of a &quot;war against terrorism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Klerk, the last apartheid era president, testified last year that he regretted the abuses but was not personally responsible; panel officials said he is due to appear again before the commission with other National Party leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secret government documents show De Klerk and other former ministers discussed forming paramilitary units to combat terrorism &quot;using their own methods,&quot; according to South African press reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, convicted police hit squad boss Eugene de Kock told a pretoria court that De Klerk, his predecessor P.W.  Botha and other senior ministers directly ordered or were aware of murders, bombings and other abuses committed in defence of the state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mogadishu - Heavy fighting has erupted again in the streets of the Somali capital, only days after leaders of two armed Somali clan factions agreed to make peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 30 people have died and nearly 50 others were wounded in heavy clashes in south Mogadishu since May 2 between militia supporters of Somali factional leaders Hussein Mohamed Aideed and Osman Hassan Ali Atto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both rivals belong to the Sa'ad sub-clan of the Habr Gedir clan of the Hawiye Somali tribe, which is dominant in south Mogadishu, but lead different factions of the United Somali Congress/Somali National Alliance (USC/SNA), which controls the southern part of the city.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heavy fighting first erupted on May 2 between the supporters of the two groups, leaving at least 24 people dead and 38 others wounded, before the fighting subsided, but continued sporadically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the night of May 6 and the morning of May 7, the fighting intensified again, this time leaving at least five people dead and seven others wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clashes came as Atto had begun negotiating with fellow clansman Aideed, after an apparent cooling in relations with his former north Mogadishu ally, Ali Mahdi Mohamed, leader of the Somali Salvation Alliance (SSA) controlling the northern half of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fighting comes a month before 26 Somali factions were due to meet at the Somali north-eastern town of Bosasso on June 10 in a final effort to appoint an interim parliament and administration to run Somalia united democratic elections are organized country wide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political analysts have pointed out that the two men have not been close since Atto failed last year to attend a conference convened in Ethiopia that was aimed at pacifying Somali warring factions at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other political analysts also attributed the source of the fighting to extremist supporters of Aideed who had rejected a new peace deal concluded between the two warlords in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, on April 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extremists are believed to be angry with Aideed for not honouring the armed struggle waged by his late father, General Mohamed Farah Aideed, &quot;by associating with the enemy of Somalia,&quot; a term used by Aideed's supporters to describe Atto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the Sanaa agreement, the details of which have not yet been made known, the two leaders are reported to have agreed to implement a ceasefire concluded in a peace accord at Nairobi in neighbouring Kenya last October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three Somali newspapers -- Maandeege, Qaran, and Mogadishu Times -- also suggested on May 7 that as a result of the peace deal between Aideed and Atto in Yemen, a new president could be named in south Mogadishu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aideed succeeded his father in August 1996 as the head of an interim government, declared by a conference of his father's supporters in Mogadishu in June 1995, but which is not recognised by other armed Somali factions and the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somalia has been without a government since the fall of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in January 1991.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on television late May 6, government spokesman Bakari Traore alleged that students were meeting with politicians &quot;to work out strategies for agitation with the aim of causing bloodshed,&quot; and claimed that the aim was to create a climate of insurrection to prevent the election being held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A student demonstration on May 6, in which portraits of President Alpha Oumar Konare were torn up, led to scuffles with the police, who threw teargas and made some 10 arrests.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Faced with such a serious situation, which imperils the achievements of our democracy, the government asks the whole nation to bear witness,&quot; Traore said, adding that &quot;the government is convinced that our people will foil plots hatched to seize power by other means than the ballot box.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 7, Malian opposition parties urged their supporters not to turn up for the first round of presidential elections at the weekend, claiming organizational defects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A coalition of 23 opposition parties issued a statement reiterating demands that the elections be delayed, that the government resign and the electoral commission be dissolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting that these demands had so far gone unmet, the statement added: &quot;This situation shows a lack of goodwill on the part of the high authorities of the republic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliament was dissolved early March, but the constitutional court annulled a first round of legislative elections on April 13 because of poor organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one opposition party leader, Mamadou Maribatrou Diaby, broke ranks on May 1 by announcing that he would run against President Konare in the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diaby, head of the Party for Unity, Progress and Democracy (PUDP) was one of nine opposition leaders who had said they would boycott the two-round vote on May 11 and 25. Others were expected to follow his lead in declaring their candidacies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party asked its supporters to abide by &quot;the law of the republic, an indispensable condition for the flourishing of Malian democracy,&quot; and called on the opposition to press for better organization &quot;while safeguarding social peace and the uninterrupted pursuit of the democratic process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diaby won just 2.16 per cent of the vote in the first round of the 1992 presidential elections, against Kenya's 44.95 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 25, the Constitutional Court annulled the first round of the legislative elections held on April 13, due to what it called &quot;serious irregularities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty two opposition parties united to reject the result of elections, which the court said had been hampered by the wide spread lack of proper electoral lists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 1, Konare called on opposition leaders to abandon their boycott of presidential poll, and Mali's politicians to join hands in overcoming the current difficulties in the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - The Catholic Archbishop of Abidjan, Ivory Coast, the Most Rev. Agre Bernard, has urged Africans to ensure that the millennium celebration at the start of the year 2000 finds a completely changed attitude in the minds of the people of the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in the Kenyan capital where he was attending an African regional bishops' meeting late April, Archbishop Bernard told APS: &quot;Let us work hard to change within ourselves because the millennium is coming. Let us use that as a turning point in our minds and perception.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archbishop Bernard said the kind of turmoil one witnesses in Africa such as the current events in Zaire were &quot;a shame for us in the continent. We have to change our mind and be more serious in behaviour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's biggest ills, said the Ivory Coast prelate, are egocentrism, tribalism and corruption. &quot;These are the things that have torn our continent asunder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We suffer from short sightedness in the way we see and conduct our affairs. Corruption is everywhere so we have to fight against this ill and egocentrism all the time,&quot; said the Archbishop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He continued; &quot;Tribalism is everywhere in Africa, because the man in charge thinks about his tribe first in order to promote or give them opportunities for work or business.  Everywhere you find this kind of cancer in the judiciary, customs, police or other government departments,&quot; he charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Archbishop said the churches in Africa have done what they could to make people in leadership positions appreciate that many things were either going or had gone wrong. &quot;The churches have no police or gun and cannot say to errant leaders, &quot;if you don't do the right thing we will put you in jail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About his own country, the prelate said the nation of some 13 million people had improved greatly in macro-economic terms - meaning that investment and international trade had risen.  However, he lamented there was increasing of poverty among the ordinary persons in the West African country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Any agreement that does not involve all the conflicting parties is unlikely to bring lasting peace to Sudan, Bishop Lod T. Erkolano of Yei, about 1,200 kilometres south of Khartoum, has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Erkolano, whose see recently fell to the rebel Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA)-mainstream, made the remarks here on May 6 while commenting on the recent peace agreement signed between the Khartoum Government and rebel groups in the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement, aimed at ending the 14-year-old civil war, did not include the SPLA-mainstream led by Dr. John Garang.  Also excluded from the pact was the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which links Dr. Garang's group and six banned political parties that decided to take up arms late last year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The southern rebel groups that signed the April 21 peace pact were South Sudan Independent Movement/Army (SSIM/A) of Dr. Riek Machar, Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (Bahr al-Ghazal group) of Kerubino Kwanyin Bol, Kawa Makwel-led South Sudan Independent Group (SSIG), Equatorial Defence Force (EDF) of Dr. Theophilus Ochang Loti and the Union of African Parties USAP) led by Mr. Samuel Aru Bol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The agreement,&quot; said Bishop Erkolano, &quot;is a commendable effort towards peace.&quot; &quot;It is a good effort towards peace, but a very partial effort. It is non-comprehensive in the sense that it only involved the government and factions of the SPLA, excluding the SPLA-mainstream which is still fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it were, asserted the 54-year-old clergy, the war in Sudan is far from over and confusion was likely to arise, especially among the civilians as to which of the groups stood for their interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The way to lasting peace in Sudan, according to Bishop Erkolano, was for all the conflicting parties to come to the table and talk sincerely, honestly, understand the root cause of the Sudanese conflict and make appropriate recommendations aimed at terminating the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the root cause of the current conflict is not difficult to understand - it is basically a question of race and religion. There is a tendency to make Sudan an Arab- Islamic country, which means a country that has to be Arab in culture and Islamic in religion. This has no basis for peace and equality as it leaves out non-Arabs and non-Muslims, who are also genuine Sudanese citizens. If this issue of inequality is not going to be addressed by the government in power, then the war in Sudan will continue for a very long time,&quot; observed the Yei bishop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the recent agreement, Sudan's 10 Southern states' inhabited mainly by Christians and traditionalists, will fall under a Transitional Co-ordination Council, which will oversee the local state governments. National security, foreign policy, banking and tax collection will remain in the hands of the federal government in Khartoum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the pact is not violated, a referendum will be held in the year 2001 in the South to determine whether its people want a separate state or wish to remain united with the predominantly Muslim north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SPLA-mainstream has called the agreement a sham and continues to fight in the south and with its NDA allies in the east.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the former Sudanese Prime Minister Ali Mahdi, Bishop Erkolano does not rule out a possibility of two Sudanese nations if the northern Arab-Muslims find it impossible to co- exist with their non-Muslim brothers in the South. Dr. Garang is totally opposed to the division of Africa's most expansive country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - The killing of a 50 year-old faithful of the (Anglican) Church of the Province of Kenya (CPK) St. Stephen's Shikomari Church of Maseno North Diocese has elicited condemnation from the provincial secretary of the CPK, Rev.  Canon Enos Ashimala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victim, the late Murunga Musita from Shamboko archdeaconery was stoned to death in an incident that also left a pastor seriously injured, when two rival groups battled it our over what incumbent diocesan bishop, Rt. Rev. Simon Oketch claimed was an agitation by one group to split the Maseno Diocese and create their own to be named River Nzoia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The May 4, 1997 incident in Shikomari Church brings to mind one witnessed last year at the CPK Kajiado Diocese, in which Rev. Bernard Njoroge was hurt when a physical confrontation ensued between his supporters and those opposed to him, when Archbishop David Gitari, then in acting capacity was officiating at a function in the see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canon Ashimala said the Anglican church promotes peace and justice and when an incidence like the one in Maseno North takes place, &quot;then something is terribly wrong and it needs to be addressed quickly.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While maintaining that he was not in a position to comment on the issue since it involved a diocese under the jurisdiction of a bishop, the provincial Secretary nevertheless observed that the incumbent diocesan head should work to solve the problem since the unity of the church revolved around the bishop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Ashimala told APS such incidents undermine the credibility of the church as a peace maker, adding that it had caused shame and disgrace to the church as a whole and to the CPK fraternity in particular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Ashimala further observed the wrangle in the church was as a result of some faithful not being satisfied with the administration of the diocese. He however, advised that their aspirations must be listened to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On whether the CPK constitution was the contributing factor to the many wrangles within the Church of the Province of Kenya, the administrator simply quipped that &quot;constitutions are made by human-beings and broken down by human-beings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contacted by APS to shed more light on the incident at St.  Stephen's Shikomari Church, Bishop Oketch declined to comment, saying he could not discuss such issues on telephone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, according to earlier press reports, Bishop Oketch had on May 6, announced the defrocking of seven priests following the violent clash, a pointer that they could have been part of the group rebelling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Oketch reportedly declared that the splinter River Nzoia Diocese could only be granted if the followers put their request in writing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bishop further explained that the withdrawal of the priests was under Canon Law Number II Sub-section 3B of the CPK constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1993 when he succeeded Bishop Israel Mundi, Bishop Oketch has encountered in his diocese with accusations to the effect that he had lied about his age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had apparently given two different years of birth - 1955 and 1953. According to the CPK constitution, the minimum age for one to become a bishop is 40 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The much publicised incidents at the Maseno North and Kajiado dioceses are not isolated cases in the CPK. Over the last decade or so, notable events have taken place, pointing to dissatisfaction among the faithful in the church's 22 dioceses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1989, a splinter group agitating for their own diocese staged a sit-in demonstration in the Nairobi compound of the then head of CPK, the Rt. Rev. Manasses Kuria. The group was dissatisfied with the administration of the Nambale Diocese Bishop Isaac Namango, whom they accused of nepotism and a host of other ills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group was granted their own Katakwa diocese in 1990.  Nambale is in Western Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such unpleasant incidents in the Anglican Church have prompted observers to remind the church of its own commitment to issues it has been known to champion in the secular field particularly concerning governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed even the current CPK head has made public his awareness that part of the church's constitution has to some extent become a stumbling block. During his enthronement early this year Archbishop Gitari expressed hope that the Provincial Constitution would be reviewed with the aim of amending some clauses &quot;which have been more of a problem to the church than a blessing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his Archbishop's charge, Rev. Gitari also referred to the theme of the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) 7th Assembly slated for October, 1997, and acknowledged that the African church is not only troubled from without but also from within.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Assembly in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia will discuss the theme, Troubled But Not Destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archbishop Gitari then challenged the church of Jesus Christ to do all it can to put its house in order if its ministry is effective.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LIBREVILLE, Gabon (PANA) - Gabon's High Resistance Council (HCR), a grouping of radical opposition parties, has decided to exclude the country's main opposition party, the National Rally of Bucherons (Wood Cutters) for boycotting its meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's news agency reported on Monday from Libreville that the expulsion of the Bucherons was announced by the HCR Chairman, Leon Mbou Yembit, at a political rally held in the Gabonese capital on Saturday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides the Bucherons, whose leader is also the Mayor of Libreville, the Rev Father Paul Mba Abessole, three other political parties were expelled from the HCR, thus reducing its number to some 10 political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The HCR rally was the first of its kind by opposition parties since the parliamentary and senatorial elections of December 1996 and January 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other issues at the rally, the opposition leaders reviewed the forum they held in April, which was boycotted by the Bucherons and the other expelled parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During Saturday's rally, the HCR leaders opposed the proposed introduction of the post of Vice President in Gabon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Such a personality will have no power&quot;, said Pierre Mamboundou, leader of the United Democratic Front (FDU) in parliament and a member of the Gabonese People's Union (UPG).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The post is expected to be created under a constitutional amendment, which also extends the presidential term of office from five to seven years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The Commonwealth Secretary-General, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, on Monday said the current deforestation and land degradation in the world threatens planetary survival and the maintenance of a habitable biosphere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was presenting the keynote address at a Commonwealth forestry conference on &quot;Forestry in a Changing Political Environment: Challenges for the 21st Century&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyaoku said the relationship between deforestation and global warming, the likely impact of climate change on health and the consequences of a continuing loss of biodiversity and extinction of plant and animal species had become a global problem.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At local level, the dislocation of landscapes by erosion, siltation and loss of habitat is often played out well away from the media attention but is no less a tragedy for the people, often poor and living on marginal land, who depend on forests for a livelihood,&quot; Anyaoku said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Anyaoku said efforts to save the forests and promote sustainable management of the environment had yielded little results because they lacked a political dimension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, there are a number of common themes emerging from these international debates which recognizes that the forest principles adopted at the Rio Earth Summit five years ago have not been sufficient to stem the tide of forest loss,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyaoku said some of the themes coming out were a realization that forest loss could only be done with political commitments on the part of governments supported by all stake holders including the professional forestry community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Others are the idea that it is in the public interest to manage forests sustainably and equitably and a recognition that to do so we need to engage civil society and ensure that people are drawn into decision making at all appropriate levels,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from the Rio conference, Anyaoku cited previous Commonwealth forestry conferences in Oxford in 1974 and in Malaysia in 1993 which also yielded little change to the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The themes for the conferences were &quot;the forest and the global environment, and people, the environment and forestry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, while there are abundant reasons for concern, there is no excuse for gloom and doom either. There a number of international initiatives which have captured the imagination of many and the Commonwealth countries are leading the way,&quot; Anyaoku said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cited the pioneering Canadian Model Forest Programme which involved communities and stimulated partnership arrangements where there was potential conflict between logging interests and other users.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The Interim Board of the Dakar-based Pan African News Agency (PANA) has decided that December will be the deadline for the commencement of the privatization of the continental wire service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The month of December will mark the end of PANA's recovery programme, which is being undertaken in conjunction with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the board, which met in Dakar on Monday and Tuesday last week, said that before the recovery programme comes to an end, member states will be required to pay off the agency's outstanding debts, estimated at is 4.7 million U.S dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a spokesman of the Board, Ibrahim Dagash, who heads the Information division of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), one of the meeting's major decision was to appeal to African media organs to buy shares in the new PANA.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A large part of the share capital in the new PANA would be sold to the continent's public and private media,&quot; Dagash said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the board's crucial meeting was attended by all its delegates - - from the OAU, Cameroon, Egypt, Nigeria, Senegal, Sudan and Zimbabwe -- as well as experts from an audit firm, Price Waterhouse, and Citibank in Dakar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting's spokesman said PANA had now entered the last phase of the recovery plan which was submitted to the 1992 African Conference of Information Ministers in Abuja and adopted by the OAU summit in Dakar the same year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan, drawn by UNESCO and the OAU, envisages the transformation of PANA from being an inter-governmental body, into an agency operated by private as well as public shareholders, at the end of a three-year transitional period, which started in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the transitional period has been hampered by financial and administrative hitches, especially the inability of member states to pay their assessed annual contributions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To date, the accumulated arrears of contribution stand at about 30 million U.S dollars. The agency's annual budget is about 4.2 million dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, thanks to the commitment of several member states, the inter- governmental PANA was gradually emerging from the zone of turbulence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among its decisions, the PANA Interim board affirmed that the change of its legal status should not be done at the expense of its staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whatever is owed to any member of staff all over Africa will be fully paid, &quot; Dagash said, adding that &quot;there will be no privatization until staff will have received the totality of their rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board adopted what it termed as a &quot;flexible, practical and pragmatic&quot; concessional mechanism to enable member states settle their arrears of contribution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under this system, the six or seven member states who are viewed as the &quot; major debtors&quot; with arrears of between one million and 3.5 million U.S dollars, will now be required to pay only one million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, the debts of 14 countries regarded as &quot;small debtors&quot; have been slashed to 25,000 U.S dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, member states whose arrears of contribution are below one million U.S dollars, have been encouraged to settle half of the arrears, under a mechanism which will be submitted, together with the conclusions of the last board meeting, to the Conference of African Information Ministers, slated for Cairo, Egypt, from June 16-19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Dagash, the agency is expecting two major financial contributions from Libya (1.1 million U.S dollars) and UNESCO (720,000 U.S dollars).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elaborating further on the share capital, Dagash said that in the new PANA, 25 percent of the share capital will belong to member states through their national news agencies while 20 percent will be reserved for other African media organs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 55 percent of the share capital will be reserved for telecommunication bodies and other private interests, some of whom have already shown interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dagash said an information campaign to publicize and promote the PANA project will be undertaken in conjunction with partners who are conversant with the African financial market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The publicity campaign will involve round tables in at least 16 countries while the information on the commercialization programme will be available in all African states through the network of &quot;Citibank&quot; and ministries of information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PANA interim board says that although the agency's privatization is &quot; irreversible&quot; this does not indicate that Africans were surrendering their important development tool into the hands of non-Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The objective is to make the agency viable and efficient by providing it with &quot;the means to ensure its efficiency and competitiveness of its products on a highly sensitive market.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another member of the PANA Interim Board, Abdou Gningue, the director of the Senegalese News Agency, noted that &quot; in the final analysis, the future PANA should be some sort of a cooperative of African media organs, along the lines of the Associated Press of the United States.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI, Kenya (PANA) - Some 100,000 flamingoes have returned to their Lake Nakuru sanctuary, in the Kenyan section of the rift valley, which they had deserted when it started drying up, a game warden has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The warden of the area, Daniel Kilonzo, said a large number of the flamingoes had migrated to the neighbouring rift valley lakes of Bogoria and Elementaita, in Kenya.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said recently that the birds had returned to the sanctuary by the end of March and that the numbers had increased sharply since the onset of the heavy rains now pounding the whole country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost the entire flamingo population, which at best swells to 1.5 million when the water level is high and their food, blue green algae is abundant, had fled in 1996 when the lake receded leaving only strips of water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kilonzo said that seasonal rivers such as the Ndarugu and the Nderit, which had dried up, were now flowing into the lake, whose inflow is swelled by treated affluent from neighbouring industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from the flamingoes that had migrated, he said, Lake Nakuru National Park did not lose any other game due to the drought and those animals that had been weakened by lack of pasture had now gained weight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The park also boasts a rhino breeding herd introduced a decade ago, hundreds of buffaloes, water bucks, warthogs and giraffe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) - Sudanese wildlife authorities have said that animals in Dinder Park, eastern Sudan, have remained unharmed by the ongoing war between government and rebel forces in the surrounding areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dinder, is the world's third largest natural park, surpassed only by Tsavo Game Park in Kenya and Radoum Park in western Sudan. Dinder's 2,352 square kilometers (908 square miles) is a landmass greater than Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta and Monaco combined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, the director of protected areas in the Sudanese Wildlife Conservation Administration, John Awang Awok, denied Ethiopian territory had originated from Dinder Park.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The park is firmly protected and game wardens are on absolute alert and full control,&quot; he told PANA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dinder stretches into neighbouring Ethiopia and Eritrea and has for decades been Sudan's major tourist attraction, by virtue of its varied flora and fauna.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the road to the area is rudimentary, foreigners still flock there to take photos of wild beasts, birds and plants, as well to experience the thrill of spending a night among the calls of animals and birds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Awok conceded that the war had affected the life of animals outside the park's perimeters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Migration of animals from one country to another has always been the result of wars and natural catastrophes like drought and desertification,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tourists and game rangers from the area, he said, told him recently that &quot; no single animal had left the reserve since the outbreak of the fighting&quot; in the area January 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As regards western media claims that 33 rhinos were found dead in Ethiopian territory, he said &quot;We can precisely say that the Dinder Park has nothing to do with the matter as we do not have any rhinos in that park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he warned that unlicensed farmers and poachers constituted a threat to the park's plants and animals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main threat started in the 1980s when 400 families moved into the park after one of the most severe droughts. These families came and settled down with their cattle, goats and sheep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike parks elsewhere in Africa, Dinder has not yet been invaded by foreign poachers. The only threat, Awok said, came &quot;from nationals who smuggle themselves inside the area to chop down trees&quot; for making charcoal.  Some trees are also destroyed by people looking for honey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other issue of concern is the presence of commercial farmers &quot;who use such advanced equipment as tractors to plough as much land as they can for cultivation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mechanized farming has led to soil degradation and loss of fertility, thus limiting the chances for plant diversity, a major tourist attraction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illegal hunting is also posing a threat to animal species like antelopes, deer and other animals whose meat is easy to dry using traditional methods.  Guinea fowl are the most targeted birds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of these man-made disasters, Awok said: &quot;Our park, like any park everywhere in the world, plays the role of recreation, education, scientific research and ecological awareness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said that greater protection was required to safeguard certain animals from extinction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that The National Centre for Research reported in 1994 that 266 species of the mammalia class and four of 938 avian kingdom were under threat of extinction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To preserve biodiversity, Sudanese wildlife authorities have since the 1930s created a number of natural protected areas. These include eight national parks and 17 reserves where no one is allowed to hunt or farm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan's Environment Protection Association says that five of these areas are in northern Sudan and the rest in the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the association's complaints are the transformation of the Rahad Protected Area, about 880 kilometers (550 miles) south of Khartoum, into a mechanized agricultural farm.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PART II - DETAILS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. EAST AFRICA: REGIONAL OPERATION FOR BURUNDI, RWANDA, ZAIRE, TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. ZAIRE - most information as of 8 May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 Ninety-one refugees were trampled to death or suffocated in an overcrowded Kisangani-bound train, on Sunday 4 May. Panic seized the refugees while they were boarding the train at Biaro and the safe capacity of the train was exceeded. As a result of this accident and in order to allow better coordination of refugee movements, the transport of refugees by train was temporarily suspended. Train operations resumed on 6 May and in addition to the two trains, there are now 11 trucks shuttling refugees from Biaro to Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 Since the beginning of the air repatriation operation on 30 April, until 7 May, 12,024 refugees were flown home to Rwanda. Three WFP planes are involved in this operation. The two Il-76 are flying the refugees directly to Kigali while the Hercules C-130 takes refugees to Gisenyi and Cyangugu. The same planes continue shuttling food and non-food items into Kisangani. From 28 April to 4 May, WFP delivered 182 metric tons of food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 A transit centre has been established near Kisangani International Airport to accommodate the refugees while they are waiting for air transport to Rwanda. An average of 4,000 refugees have been staying at the centre, planned to host a maximum 1,000 persons. WFP has provided food commodities for a wet feeding programme, run by the NGO OMNIS. Community kitchens are also operating at Biaro, where some 40,000 refugees await repatriation.  Presently eight kitchens, run by OMNIS, EUB and Caritas, provide meals to over 5,000 refugees, mainly unaccompanied children and sick refugees. WFP plans to increase the number of kitchens at the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 Biaro refugees are now also benefiting from general distributions.  Since 30 April, WFP has moved 70 metric tons of food to this site, despite an acute lack of trucks to shuttle food between the rail depot and the refugee camp. There has also been an improvement in the provision of health services and water, however these still need to be augmented to cover the number and state of the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.5 It has been reported that some 5,000 refugees are presently at Obilo, km 82 and a few also at Ubundu. As of 8 May, WFP was awaiting clearance to despatch 26 metric tons of food by train to these locations. Access of expatriate staff from aid agencies beyond Biaro is being restricted by the authorities, and it is now more than three weeks since aid workers were last able to visit there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.6 Approximately 50,000 refugees formerly in camps in Goma and Bukavu have reached Mbandaka, near the border Zaire/Congo and have started to receive food assistance. WFP has transported 765 metric tons of maize by barge from Kinshasa to Mbandaka, for distribution to these refugees. Upon arrival at the port, a large number of people attempted to loot the maize from the barges and these had to be moved offshore. Update, 9 May: the 765 metric tons have been safely received by the Catholic diocese of Mbandaka, the Zairian Red Cross and IFRC, who are undertaking the distribution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.7 In eastern Zaire, humanitarian traffic along parts of the Bukavu/Goma road has been suspended owing to insecurity. In Bukavu, a curfew is now in place, allegedly due to the infiltration of armed ex-FAR and Interahamwe into Rwanda. Access to refugees and way stations is restricted to two axes, Walungu and Mwenga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. RWANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.1 Tension remains high in the prefectures of Gisenyi and Ruhengeri with the ongoing repatriation from Zaire. Various incidents were reported in the area, the most serious being an attack by a group of armed men on a school in Gisenyi. Seventeen students were killed along with four residents of the area and a Belgian teacher, and nine other students were seriously wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.2 Over 1,000 unaccompanied children have so far arrived in Rwanda from Zaire. Supplementary rations are being provided to these children. All arriving returnees are being provided with high-energy biscuits and wet feeding while at the transit centres. A one-month food ration is also distributed to all returnees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.3 Rains are affecting the delivery of food in many parts of the country and hampering project activities. A land slide damaged already completed sections of the Mizingo/Arusha road. No food deliveries could be made to the communes of Gituza and Cyumba in Byumba, as the roads have become impassable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. BURUNDI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.1 Bujumbura and the northern areas of the country remained relatively calm, with a single mine incident reported, killing two people. In southern Burundi, the situation is however volatile. In Makamba, rebel attacks caused the displacement of some 20,000 persons. Clashes were also reported along the border with Tanzania and in Bururi, a large group of rebels attacked a seminary killing 36 students and 7 instructors and injuring another 40 persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.2 Joint assessment missions visited Bubanza, Bururi and Muramvya provinces. In Bubanza, 86,190 Burundians are grouped in 36 displaced and regroupement camps. In this province people in camps have access to their fields and military escorts are provided for harvesting. A good harvest is anticipated. In Bururi and Muramvya, WFP is considering options for food assistance to some of the most vulnerable areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.1 Another 6,165 Burundian refugees were registered at the Kasulu and Kibondo camps in Tanzania, fleeing violence in Burundi. Tanzania now hosts over 390,000 refugees: 105,000 in Kagera region and 285,652 in Kigoma region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.2 Deplorable road conditions due to heavy rains in the districts of Kigoma, Kasulu and Kibondo continue to hamper food movements. Seven trucks carrying food commodities from Isaka to Kibondo got stuck and had to be diverted. A shortfall of pulses was experienced in all camps in Kigoma, caused by the late arrival of trucks and wagons. Further shortages are likely if road conditions are not improved. Efforts to repair some of the worst road stretches continue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 Food deliveries to Gulu and Kitgum districts, for distribution to displaced persons continue. From 28 April to 4 May, 80 metric tons of maize meal were despatched to Kitgum and 181 metric tons of various commodities were sent to Gulu. WFP also despatched to Kitgum 28 metric tons of seeds procured by the French Embassy. ICRC and ACCORD/OXFAM are planning distributions of seeds and hoes and WFP food will be supplied at the same time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 All five major hospitals in the districts of Gulu and Kitgum were supplied with corn soya blend, sugar, pulses and vegetable oil for supplementary and therapeutic feeding programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 Eighty people who had been abducted were recovered by the Ugandan Army at the border of Sudan and were handed over to the World Vision Trauma Centre in Gulu. Some of these were severely malnourished and dehydrated and were admitted into Lacor Hospital, for supplementary or therapeutic feeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. SUDAN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 WFP began a 200 metric ton airlift operation into Juba on 10 April to cover urgent food aid needs of 14,540 displaced persons and refugees. A total of 132 metric tons have been delivered to date. Displaced persons and refugees in Juba (caseload 162,000) are receiving full rations. Nutritional status in Juba is reported as stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 During the month of April, a total of 166 metric tons of food commodities were distributed to 52,640 displaced persons and returnees in Equatoria. Beneficiaries received food in Mundri (6,000), Maridi (3,840), Yambio (7,000) and Yei (35,800). WFP has agreed to supply some 5,100 metric tons of food to partly meet the relief food needs of a total of 100,000 returnees in the Yei area from April through August. Some 350 metric tons of maize meal are currently en-route to the area via Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 Due to extended delays in obtaining Government clearance for the departure of a barge loaded with 3,960 metric tons of food in Kosti since early April, WFP has decided to cancel the operation. Food intended for Juba will be utilised for other projects requiring immediate assistance, while the balance will be distributed in Tonga/Fanjak, pending government clearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 The recent suspension of WFP and UNICEF humanitarian flights into Sudan airspace, under the Operation Lifeline Sudan umbrella, is the subject of high level discussions between the UN organizations concerned and the Government of Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D. SIERRA LEONE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 On 6 May, two vehicles carrying UN and Concern Universal staff were caught in an ambush in Madina, approximately 5 miles outside of Makeni en route to Freetown. Gunfire hit both vehicles, leaving a UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) driver dead and injuring the DHA head of operations in Sierra Leone. UN road movements to Bo and Kenema from Freetown have been suspended in light of this incident and other security problems at mile 91 in Makeni, where more than 32 metric tons of WFP bulgur wheat, vegetable oil and CSB were looted on 17 April following fighting between soldiers and Kamajors (traditional hunters who form militia units).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 In Kenema, heavy fighting between government soldiers and Kamajors resulted in the temporary evacuation of WFP and other humanitarian agency staff to Freetown early this week. To date, a total of 25 people have been killed and 60 injured due to the fighting, which broke out on 2 May.  Additionally, at least 180 people are reported displaced as a result of fire to houses. In response to open soldier and Kamajor fighting, President Kabbah has established a commission of inquiry to investigate the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 WFP is providing a three-day wet ration and a one-month resettlement ration to the first batch of 600 refugees returning from Liberia. A total of 2,400 refugees are expected to be repatriated by UNHCR over the next month.  Meanwhile, WFP continues to distribute one-month resettlement rations to returning internally displaced persons from Freetown camps. From 16 April to date, 950 internally displaced persons have been resettled in Bonthe, Kenema and Kono districts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - They owe an allegiance to a sports club in an English industrial city, but you will find them across the world. In Cape Town they are especially strong. They are the fans of Manchester United Football Club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And they are celebrating this week because, once again, United are the English league champions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These fans, who identify so closely with the club that they use the personal pronoun, often talk about &quot;us&quot; and &quot;we&quot; when they mean Manchester United FC, and hardly a season goes by without &quot;them&quot; winning some trophy or other. This year they won the league, ironically on a night when they weren't even in action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, when rivals Liverpool were beaten and Newcastle held to a draw, the league became theirs for the 20th time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Man United, as they are widely known, are not only champions. They are also the most famous soccer team in the world, probably the most popular, and a global marketing device.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, sales by Manchester United Merchandising Ltd reached R381- million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the world there are 150 000 official members of the supporters club and in South Africa there are 1 000 of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the last figure is hardly an indication of the club's real support.  Multiply the number by about 100, says local supporters' club chairman Bernard O'Neill, and you'll get a better idea of just how many people in this country back the Red Devils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years ago, when Man United played fellow English Premier League team Arsenal at Ellis Park, the match attracted 63 000 spectators. Mr O'Neill, a Cape Town businessman, believes only 3 000 were Arsenal fans. &quot;The rest were Man United fans, so that gives you some idea of how big we are in South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaizer Chiefs, South Africa's most popular club, has 23 000 card-carrying members, according to spokesman Farhad Garda. About two years ago, he says a poll found that their &quot;unofficial&quot; support was 1.5 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local businessman Eduard Sjouerman, who imports soccer memorabilia, estimates that about 50 percent of the strong support for British soccer in this country is made up of Manchester United fans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thirty percent are Liverpool supporters and the rest are spread between Arsenal, Spurs and some of the other clubs,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The popularity of Man United partly explains why so many South African soccer fans have an obsession with the British game. The club's sales pitch also contributes to it. &quot;It's an amazing market operation,&quot; says Mr Sjouerman, who imports jerseys, caps and key-rings from the Man United shop at their Old Trafford home ground. He even sells, if not in great volumes, Man United wall-paper and Man United women's underwear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If marketing is one reason, sentiment may be another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The air crash at Munich in 1958, in which eight of the club's players died, created an aura of triumph in adversity about the club which exists to this day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles Rodgers of Umbro, which makes replica Man United jerseys and tracksuits, believes this is one of the reasons. &quot;The air-crash tragedy has contributed to the sentiment surrounding the club. But, also, they keep on winning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does that explain the unusual diversity of support? From Bonteheuwel to Bishops-court, from Mowbray to Manenberg, there are Man United supporters.  Where did this come from?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Veteran soccer administrator Vincent Baartjes believes the roots lie in the old political system. &quot;This has come about over many years when South Africa was fed a diet of white football,&quot; he said. &quot;People were led to believe that 'white was right' and it's a worrying factor especially in the Western Cape.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Man United played Arsenal at Ellis Park, Mr Baartjes pointed out, the &quot; hue of the crowd&quot; was significant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The implication is there: black soccer fans feel at home with Chiefs and Bafana Bafana. Can it be that white, coloured and Indian fans look to M-Net for their heroes?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Television obviously has played a big role. M-Net Supersport shows live matches in the English Premier League at least three times a week and researchers say those which feature Man United draw the biggest audiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before the TV era in South Africa, Andreas Gabriel, an official of local club Hellenic, showed recordings of British matches at the Whitehouse Hotel in Strand Street. The shows ran to packed houses at lunch times and in the evenings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There, the seeds for a Man United mania may have been laid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Augustides, whose family owns Mike's Sport in Woodstock - one of the biggest soccer retailing outlets in South Africa - says: &quot;The TV coverage has helped create the hype about British clubs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hype has also turned South Africa into a Man United customer. Andrew Seed, who is the strategic development manager of Manchester United Merchandising Ltd, says that outside Britain the biggest buyers are from Scandinavia, Ireland and the Far East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We see our brand name in global terms now. But we still have a long way to go and there is obviously a lot of potential in South Africa and the Middle East.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the individual customers is Stephen White, a 46-year-old Transnet worker, who has collected what amounts to a Man United shrine in his Parow home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has a great variety of jerseys, caps, shirts and trinkets, but pride of place goes to an item not on the Man U mail-order list - a club banner of pure silk which he bought in a small shop in the back streets of Hong Kong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another collector, although not on such a grand scale, is Clive Titus of Grassy Park, who remembers getting hooked on the club while a young teenager in District Six. &quot;I got a book, Father Of Football, from the library,&quot; he recalls. &quot;It was about Matt Busby (legendary manager of the club who survived the air crash) and I was hooked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the reasons behind the Man United phenomenon, it knows no boundaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From people like Graham Jones, a young, unemployed man from Retreat to Tessa Dasopatis, a businesswoman from Welgelegen, to Cecil Lindsay, 47, an electrician's assistant from Manenberg, they will tell you: &quot;We are the champions.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The Johnson Consortium, led by Johannesburg businessman Harold Johnson, has become the sole owner of Zevenwacht Wine Estate in a deal sanctioned by the High Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consortium consists of Mr Johnson, his wife Denise and the Harold Johnson Family Trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The saga began in the early 1980s when the previous proprietor, Cape Town architect Gilbert Colyn, decided to raise finance from the public for various developments and the day-to-day running of the farm.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea of owning a piece of the Cape winelands, albeit a rather small one, tempted many investors to pay between R1 and R3,50 a share for the 4,5- million or so shares Mr Colyn eventually sold to investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by 1992 it had become apparent that the estate was hopelessly insolvent - and Zevenwacht's bankers foreclosed on its loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Colyn's other business venture, architects Colyn and Meiring, was also liquidated about the same time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was when the estate first came to Mr Johnson's attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Johnson, a Johannesburg businessman well known in the construction industry as the owner of Johnson Crane Hire, read the report of the the estate's pending liquidation in a newspaper and called the estate's bankers &quot; to find out what the story was&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I essentially bought Gilbert Colyn's 95 percent stake in the company by settling the company's debt,&quot; said Mr Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I hadn't paid the banks, the farm would have been liquidated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was harvest time when I arrived and the previous vintage was still sitting in the vats because there were no bottles - so I bought bottles in order to bring in the harvest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Johnson has invested about R50-million in the farm, including the purchase price for his shares, over the past six years, establishing the estate as a premier tourist attraction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This included a complete renovation of the original farm buildings with a first-class restaurant and building a plush &quot;country inn&quot;, cottages and conference centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most recent addition has been a cheese factory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The wine on its own will never be profitable - you need to add value- adding businesses,&quot; said Mr Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the estate has remained unprofitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, Mr Johnson does not see it returning to profitability &quot;within the next generation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The losses were exacerbated by the cost of maintaining Zevenwacht Wine Estate as a public company and, with this in mind, Mr Johnson proposed the scheme of arrangement which saw the Johnson Consortium buy out the remaining five percent of the shares in the estate not controlled by his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consortium offered 13c a share, which was accepted by 97 percent of the outside shareholders at a general meeting to ratify the scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I fell in love with the farm and the area,&quot; Mr Johnson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has also bought Zevenrivieren, another farm on the other side of Stellenbosch, and recently sold Johnson Crane Hire to Murray &amp; Roberts so that he could move to the winelands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zevenwacht, he says, is a bottomless pit, &quot;but it's a very nice one&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr Johnson has kept his finger in the profitable business pie with other ventures in and around Cape Town, most notably the Simon's Town waterfront development at the town's old pier.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Influential Cape Town community leaders who refused to attend the recent launch of the Olympic peace initiative which included gangs have agreed to take part in the process and monitor crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This comes as a boost to the plan, which has been labelled &quot;naive&quot; because it includes gangsters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad) has criticised the initiative, which aims to to bolster Cape Town's bid to host the 2004 Olympics by reducing crime .</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group of community leaders withdrew from the Community Olympic Forum initiative at the last minute,, saying the launch was premature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitchell's Plain Anglican priest Matt Esau, Community Peace Foundation executive director Nombulelo Mkefa, its programmes manager Sulayman Isaacs, businessman and former political activist Peter Jones and Gavin Pieterse president of the regional Black Management Forum, were initially asked to monitor the Olympic Peace Initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Mkefa said the Olympic bid could serve as a catalyst to help combat crime in the city centre and on the Cape Flats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hold strong beliefs in the need for ongoing focus on the collective responsibility of Cape Town to integrate all communities into a common stream by the reconstruction and development of the total social fabric of communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people of the Cape Flats are historically traumatised through their physical and social dislocation from their own city. The culture of gangs and criminality have permeated these communities over many years,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group wished to help in the emergence of a comprehensive and holistic approach to the healing and normalisation of communities and accept the Olympic initiative as an opportunity to raise public awareness to reduce crime and violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Jones said the Olympic peace initiative was part of the process the group would be monitoring but this would be done in consultation with various bodies such as the secretariat for safety and security, anti-crime forums, street committees and neighbourhood watches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said this initiative was not bound to any Olympic timetable but was a serious attempt at getting communities to become normal again.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - A Khayelitsha woman died last week after being denied treatment at a clinic her husband had pushed her to in a wheelbarrow and after the failure of authorities to call an ambulance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a horror image from the old South Africa: a desperate Khayelitsha husband loaded his sick wife onto a wheelbarrow and took her to a clinic where she was denied treatment because the establishment was about to close for the day. Instead of summoning an ambulance to take the &quot;chronically terminally ill&quot; woman directly to hospital, authorities urged the husband to take her to a larger 24-hour clinic from where a routine ambulance service ferried patients to hospital. In the nightmare journey by wheelbarrow to the second clinic, the woman died.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past, many black patients suffered and died because the petty bureaucratic rules of apartheid forbad white hospitals and ambulances to attend to them. It matters little to the bereaved family of Thobeka Madayi, or to the Khayelitsha community, that her undignified and traumatic death last week was not the result of racial laws. In large measure it was caused nevertheless by the callous enforcement of petty bureaucracy; by placing rules above the compassionate treatment of people in urgent need of help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is widely known that the health care system is in the process of radical transformation and that it is operating under severe budget constraints. And there is much sympathy for the staff at day hospitals who are battling to cope with an influx of patients following the introduction of free primary health care. But surely a woman who had been terminally ill for a long time could have been made comfortable at the first day hospital until an ambulance arrived?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health Minister Ebrahim Rasool has said that the top priority for the provincial health service is to make it more caring. Nothing could illustrate the urgent need for this more compellingly, than the shameful death of Thobeka Mayani.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Surprising new crime trends have emerged in Cape Town's suburbs with the release of police statistics this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They show Cape Town central reported the highest number of incidents by far 1 934 for seven types of crimes committed from January to March this year followed by Mitchell's Plain (1 553 ), Woodstock (664), Claremont (658), Sea Point (597), Bellville South (516) and Khayelitsha (512).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistics on murder, rape, armed robbery, attempted murder, residential burglaries, business break-ins and theft out of motor vehicles were collected at 19 police stations in the Peninsula area.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crime figures for the first three months of this year were compared with the same period in 1995 and 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the seven crimes surveyed in the city centre, 70 percent of incidents involved theft out of motor vehicles, followed by theft from residences and businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But figures showed this was a 23 percent decrease on last year. Armed robberies were also down 30 percent on 1996 figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitchell's Plain has shown an overall drop in crime so far this year but violent crime remains rampant, along with theft from houses and cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khayelitsha has particularly high figures for murder, attempted murder, armed robbery and rape, and low rates for theft from motor vehicles and businesses. Most of the murders occur in or near the 1 000-odd illegal shebeens, and police are planning to tighten control of them, station commander Hennie Haarhof said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khayelitsha's shocking rape statistics 102 incidents between January and March this year are closely followed by Mitchell's Plain, Nyanga, Bellville South and Guguletu, while figures remain high for Manenberg, Bishop Lavis, the city centre, Elsies River and Grassy Park. The suburbs of Rondebosch, Kirstenhof and Camps Bay reported the lowest rape statistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyanga and Guguletu are the third and fourth most violent suburbs, according to the police figures, yet their overall crime rates are relatively low. This was because instead of reporting to police, Guguletu residents tended to rely on street committees to solve problems of petty theft, assault and malicious damage to property, head of the crime prevention unit, Bertie Brink, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taxi violence accounts for most of the violence perpetrated in Nyanga, but a new police strategy is expected to make a dent in these figures, head of communications Robbie Robberts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crime levels had also taken a knock from the efforts of a strong community policing forum and the effective functioning of the community-based peace and development project, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Levels of violence remain high in Bishop Lavis and Elsies River with figures for attempted murder up this year, but murder rates have declined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bellville South was the sixth most violent of the suburbs surveyed and also had high figures for house break-ins and theft out of motor vehicles. Yet the levels of most of the measured crimes have dropped in the are over the last three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murders in Manenberg have stabilised nine each for the first three months of 1996 and this year, compared with 25 in 1995. But attempted murders, armed robberies and rape statistics remain high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the southern suburb of Claremont, armed robberies and house break-ins have increased steadily in the past three years, while the risk of murder or rape remains fairly low.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The ANC's Morris Seabelo Rehabilitation Centre in Angola - also known as Camp 32 or Quatro - was the only camp at which prisoners were held for significant periods, the ANC report stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was 200km north of Luanda, between two MK training camps and, because of the war and the condition of the road, took four hours to reach from the Angolan capital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the three camps had running water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Difficulties with transport , food, water and medical supplies were general in the region, and common to all camps. &quot;The camp (32) did have a truck, but when it broke down it was not replaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the absence of transport, inmates had to push a water tank to the nearest source of water, a river about three kilometres away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Camp 32 had no doctor but relied on some medical orderlies - who were not equipped to deal with complex medical problems. &quot;Overcrowding and the unhealthy conditions in the cells created conditions for disease and did result in some deaths - although most deaths happened because of malaria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem of overcrowding at Camp 32 got &quot;steadily worse&quot; over the years, before being reviewed in 1987. There were certain cases of the abuse of prisoners by guards belonging to the ANC's Department of Security and Intelligence, who resented what they considered to be a &quot;dead-end&quot; posting at the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All ANC camps in Angola, including Camp 32, were closed down in 1989 and all but 32 prisoners were released. These prisoners were transferred to a jail in Uganda and released and allowed to return to South Africa in 1991, the ANC report stated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC said in its report it believed firmly that reparations were necessary, particularly to victims of gross human rights abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unless there are meaningful reparations, the process of ensuring justice and reconciliation will be flawed.&quot; Reparations could include such things as special pensions, educational grants, skills training, medical aid, welfare, special medals, memorials and a museum in memory of those who had suffered injustices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Available resources would never be sufficient to provide reasonable reparations, the ANC said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nonetheless, there is widespread recognition that there are individuals and strata within our society and abroad who have directly benefited from the system which was sustained by apartheid repression.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Truth Commission should consider recommending the application of the &quot; odious debt&quot; doctrine to help mobilise resources for reparations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - An African National Congress unit planned to assassinate Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi - but the plan was stopped by the ANC's leadership as soon as it found out about it - Deputy-President Thabo Mbeki told the Truth Commission today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The admission is made in a 139-page document presented to the commission in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When ANC headquarters found out, it countermanded this (plan) and this operation was never carried out,&quot; Mr Mbeki said. The ANC leadership had never taken a formal decision to attack the IFP militarily, he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We did not, could not, regard the IFP and its members as legitimate military targets and at no stage was a decision taken to attack the IFP,&quot; Mr Mbeki said. In the IFP's submission to the Truth Commission last year, Chief Buthelezi provided substantial details of the 1986 assassination plot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also admits that former African National Congress president Oliver Tambo personally approved the 1983 car-bombing of air force headquarters in Church Street, Pretoria, in which 19 people died and more than 200 were injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also contains some details of 15 ANC members executed for spying or mutiny and nine members publicly executed in Angola for murder and the rape of Angolan women. It gives some background detail of deaths in its Angolan camps, at least seven of which were the result of severe beatings, and describes conditions in the camps and the response of the organisation's leadership to problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, in which the ANC responds to questions put by the commission following its first submission during the special hearing for political parties last year, was presented by ANC deputy-president Thabo Mbeki, who led a 20-member delegation of party heavyweights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It includes 33 pages of responses to questions and requests for elaboration by the Truth Commission. It deals with &quot;necklacing&quot; murders, operations by the ANC's military wing, Umkhonto weSizwe (MK), civilian targets, its use of landmines in border areas and allegations of &quot;excesses&quot; against its cadres and captured agents, and what steps were taken to prevent such excesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC repeats its earlier insistence that its leadership had strongly condemned some of the methods chosen to kill alleged informers and collaborators, particularly necklacing - burning victims with a petrol-filled tyre. &quot;The extent to which the National Party has consistently tried to use the phenomenon of 'necklacing' to damage the ANC raised the suspicion that they were involved in some of these incidents,&quot; the report states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Included as appendices are a list of hundreds of MK operations in which very brief details of dates, places and events are provided, a list of about 100 incidents of &quot;armed action&quot; - including several bomb attacks on Wimpy Bars, amusement arcades and snack bars in 1988 for which responsibility is either uncertain or specifically denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also included are case studies of 12 agents of the apartheid government uncovered by the ANC. South Africans among the 12 who are still living are identified only by &quot;travelling names&quot; but the ANC said it would provide real names if the TRC wanted these for specific investigations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC said it was not possible to give a detailed account of every MK operation, but that more details would be available in amnesty applications. &quot; We did not keep records of this nature, mainly for security reasons,&quot; the report stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was evident MK had acted with &quot;great restraint&quot;. It had sought to avoid civilian injury and death but mistakes had been made. There had been a number of attacks not in line with ANC policy, some of which were the result of anger at the &quot;unprecedented violence&quot; in the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC took collective responsibility for all bona fide MK operations. It acknowledged that the car-bombing of the Magoo's and Why Not bars in Durban was an official MK operation. It described it as one of the operations which was &quot;apparently&quot; senseless and caused civilian deaths but which was in fact aimed at police or SADF members.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - At noon today Monday, ACT-Norwegian Church Aid send a first flight of 13 tons of essential medicine to Kisangani in Eastern Zaire. In Kisangani a local church NGO, Cepza-Celpa, will be responsible for the distribution of the medicine to Rwandan refugees as well as internally displaced Zairian in and around Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Especially ACT has been asked to provide some of the high energy biscuits for two camps with respectively 500 and 200 Rwandan children awaiting repatriation. And while the medical situation in Kisangani is being covered by the combined actions of several NGOs, Cepza-Celpa and the local churches are among the few who can address the needs for medicine in areas outside the town of Kisangani.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A further 7 tons of medicine and 20 tons of high energy biscuits will be flown to Kisangani in the coming days to be distributed through the same channels. In a separate move ACT International is looking into procuring and transporting 24 tons of sugar and a 120 tons of Unimix to Kisangani as a contribution to the World Food Programme pipeline for the most vulnerable of the remaining Rwandan refugees. Although the airlifting of refugees back to Rwanda is progressing well there is a need to feed a substantial number of refugees in and around Kisangani while they await transport back home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the remaining refugees are in very critical conditions. Apart from the approximately 30.000 refugees at Biaro, press reports today said that 5.  000 to 6.000 refugees have been found at a village 82 kilometers south of Kisangani. A UNHCR official said to Reuters that *many people have died there and many more are on the verge of death*.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every day about 1.700 - 2.000 refugees return by the UN airlift to Rwanda which has by now brought close to 20.000 refugees back over the last weeks.  The majority of the returnees are in tolerable conditions, but still there are about 7 death among the returnees every day, mainly due to the ordeals they have gone through in Zaire. In Rwanda ACT/LWF is involved in supplying the refugees with food and non-food items like blankets, jerry cans and kitchen sets. These things are distributed by UNHCR and NGOs but all originate from ACT/LWF run warehouses across Rwanda.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - GREAT LAKES - Complex Emergency Situation Report #34, Fiscal Year (FY)1997, May 9, 1997. Note: The last situation report was dated May 2, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZAIRE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Background</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In mid-October 1996, fighting broke out in South Kivu, Zaire between the Zairian army (FAZ) and the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (Alliance) led by Laurent Kabila. The fighting caused Rwandan and Burundian refugees to flee, forcing over 700,000 Rwandans and 62,000 Burundians to repatriate by the end of 1996. Hundreds of thousands of refugees also fled west, scattering in small groups deeper into Zaire. The fighting spread north, west, and south, with the Alliance rapidly gaining territory on all fronts. The Alliance now controls most of Zaire and is poised to seize Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diplomacy and Peace Talks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kinshasa has remained generally quiet, amid apprehension that FAZ troops may loot the city before the Alliance launches its final drive. On May 4 Alliance leader Kabila and President Mobutu met for the first time aboard a South African navy ship docked at Pointe Noire, Congo. The meeting was chaired by South African president Nelson Mandela and U.N./Organization of African Unity (OAU) mediator Mohamed Sahnoun was also present. Although Mobutu offered to turn over power to an interim figure who would be authorized to organize elections, Kabila insisted that the Alliance have transitional authority. Both sides agreed to meet again in about eight days.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu flew to Gabon on May 7 to attend a meeting of regional leaders. Bill Richardson, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., arrived in the region on April 28.  Richardson's mission is to contribute to diplomatic efforts to bring Kabila and Mobutu together for talks, and to help create conditions for a &quot;soft landing&quot; -- his description for the peaceful transfer of power following the Alliance's arrival in Kinshasa. Richardson is also conveying the USG's increasing concern about alleged human rights abuses in Zaire and the repatriation effort. On May 5, Richardson met with Vice-President Paul Kagame in Kigali and with Kabila in Lubumbashi, and flew to Botswana on May 6 to meet with Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acrimony, Fuel Shortages, Accidents</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 27, the Alliance agreed to a new repatriation plan for the refugees who had gathered along the rail line south of Kisangani. The plan stipulated that the U.N. had 60 days from May 1 to move all the refugees from Eastern Zaire. Kabila subsequently called the deadline flexible, as long as there was a good-faith effort underway to repatriate the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since April 29, when the first Rwandans were flown from Kisangani, 12,024 Rwandan refugees have been flown to Kigali, Cyangugu, and Bukavu airports in Rwanda as of May 7. The number is notable, given the obstacles that have arisen in the path of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the past week. On May 1, the Government of Rwanda (GOR) declared it &quot;objects to the deliberate move by the U.N. to prolong the suffering of the Rwandan refugees; that the repatriation from Eastern Zaire be handled with utmost urgency,&quot; and that with resources from the international community, it could undertake the repatriation operation itself, completing it in two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, from May 2 through May 4, repatriation flights were hampered by a regional aviation fuel shortage. The shortage was due to the rejection of a fuel delivery, attributed to poor quality, at a regional depot in Kenya. By May 5, the shortage had eased, and that day a record 2,606 refugees flew on ten sorties to Rwanda. Within hours more obstacles impeded the repatriation.  On May 4, 91 Rwandan refugees, including women and children, were crushed or smothered to death on a train that became overloaded at Biaro, at km 41 on the Kisangani- Ubundu railroad. Another 47 refugees were injured during the trip, and an unknown number are believed to have died falling off the packed train. On May 5, the scheduled train trip was cancelled because of the accident; however, the Alliance transported 11 truckloads of refugees to the railhead at Lubunga, km 0, without UNHCR coordination. On May 7, the relief train broke down, and consequently only several hundred refugees were taken to the Kisangani transit center for onward transport to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To hasten repatriation, the UNHCR on May 7 added six more trucks to its fleet of 22, and on May 8 added a fourth Ilyushin-76, based in Entebbe. As the repatriation operation proceeded in fits and starts, Dr. Ephraim Kabaija, the Government of Rwanda (GOR) advisor on refugees, charged on May 6 that the UNHCR's &quot;gross inefficiency and mismanagement&quot; had been responsible for the deaths of refugees on the train from Biaro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alliance-UN Efforts to Cooperate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 2, Moise Nyarugabo, Kabila's chief of staff, met with UNHCR officials in Kisangani and agreed to give the UNHCR control and management of the truck, train, and ferry movements along the rail line. Nyarugabo also agreed to permit U.N. and relief organizations to provide emergency lifesaving assistance to the refugees, and to erect temporary structures at Biaro; and to allow the severely ill and wounded refugees access to Kisangani general hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Nyarugabo's meeting in Kisangani, the UNHCR and relief agencies worked to improve conditions at Biaro. Oxfam installed a temporary water treatment station; Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) set up triage teams to identify the refugees who required immediate evacuation due to gunshot and machete wounds or malnutrition; the World Food Program (WFP), local Red Cross, and Caritas began food distributions to both refugees and local Zairians, and built communal kitchens for wet feeding; UNICEF and Save the Children (SCF) identified and began transporting unaccompanied children (UAC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alliance Dissatisfaction and Cooperation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relief community is concerned that recent local radio broadcasts in Kisangani are hostile to the presence of the refugees and to the assistance they receive. A May 7 broadcast criticized the UNHCR for defending the refugees, while local Zairians continued to be victimized by their presence.  Alliance soldiers continue to deny humanitarian workers access to the rail line below km 42. No one from the international community has been permitted below km 42 since April 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More encouraging news also emerged on May 7, however. At a meeting with U.N.  and NGO representatives and a member of the USAID/Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART), the vice-governor of Haut-Zaire province in Kisangani announced that 11 Alliance liaison officers would be assigned to work in Kisangani in two-man teams at Biaro camp, the ferry crossing, the transit center, and the international airport. The vice-governor has also announced that a weekly meeting will be held to review the coordination, and investigation of the May 4 train deaths revealed that neither the Alliance nor the relief community could be singled out for blame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all, about half of the 91,000 refugees who had gathered along the 125-km corridor last month are unaccounted for. Since the Alliance reopened the corridor, surviving refugees have stated that armed, uniformed men massacred refugees in the corridor. In the face of international criticism, Kabila went to Kisangani on April 27 to meet with UNHCR officials. He denied that his troops had killed refugees. U.N., European, and USG officials, including Ambassador Richardson, however, have continued to press the Alliance on the importance of guarding the refugees' human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other Refugees in Zaire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WFP has dispatched a mission to assess the composition and needs of about 51,000 Rwandan refugees who have gathered in and around Mbandaka, Equateur province, near Congo. They are believed to be refugees who had fled Tingi-Tingi in March. There are reportedly three clusters: 16,100 refugees are in Wenji; 15 km from Mbandaka; 25,000 are in Ingende; and 10,000 are in Lola, near Ingende. Some may have begun to cross the Zaire River into Congo.  WFP plans to distribute 765 MT of food from river barges at Mbandaka. There are unconfirmed reports that local authorities disarmed 1,200 of the refugees and isolated them on an island in the river. In Brazzaville, about 400 Rwandan refugees have arrived, joined by 5,000 other Rwandan, Burundian, and Zairian refugees. Near the Angolan border in Zaire there are about 7,000 Rwandan refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Internally Displaced Returning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From April 7 to May 5, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and U.N. agencies returned about 3,800 internally displaced persons (IDPs) from Kisangani to Goma and Bukavu. On May 4, Caritas reported that its survey of remaining IDPs in the Kisangani area showed there were only 3,500 in a 100 km radius of the city, and there may be fewer than 1,000 IDPs left to be airlifted. It plans to end its air service between Goma and Bukavu by this weekend. A USAID/DART field officer visited Punia on April 29 and found 511 Rwandan refugees. Most were in good condition and were eager to return home.  There were also 300 IDPs who were in good health and who intend to return home. UNHCR hopes to secure a Buffalo aircraft that would repatriate the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An advance team for a U.N. commission of inquiry met with the Alliance justice minister in Lubumbashi this week. Roberto Garreton, the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Zaire, is waiting in Kigali with a team of nine investigators, including forensic specialists, for Alliance permission to enter eastern Zaire. Their mission follows Garreton's April 2 report on a fact- finding mission he conducted in Eastern Zaire in late March. His report mentioned 40 alleged cases of mass murders, summary executions, and enforced disappearances in Alliance-controlled territory, allegedly committed by Alliance troops as well as ex-FAR/Interahamwe members. The mission follows a U.N. Security Council resolution that calls for an investigation of human rights abuses in Eastern Zaire since September 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late April, the secretary-general of the U.N. Security Council issued a statement, noting its alarm over human rights abuses in Eastern Zaire, and on April 28, the secretary-general of the OAU expressed &quot;deep concern&quot; about reports of killings of refugees in Eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RWANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Massacre in Gisenyi Prefecture Seventeen schoolgirls, a Belgian religious lay worker, and four residents were murdered by armed men, allegedly members of the Interahamwe on April 28 in Satinsyi commune, Gisenyi prefecture. The attack echoed an assault in March in Kibuye prefecture. In both cases, the attackers reportedly ordered the victims to separate by ethnicity. When they refused, the attackers opened fire on everyone. On May 2, Rwandan state radio reported that 19 of 150 suspects in the attack had been killed by security forces in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Violations Cited</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda (HRFOR) reported that in the first three months of 1997, 45 genocide survivors and persons associated with them were killed, and that 28 persons were killed in three incidents, presumably because of their Tutsi ethnicity. HRFOR also noted a &quot;significant number&quot; of killings by army troops occurred while the victims were allegedly trying to evade arrest, or escape. While noting that the start of the genocide trials were an important step to overcome a culture of impunity, HRFOR also recommended that the GOR improve conditions of detention; review its system of arrest and detention; provide HRFOR with full and confidential access to persons in military detention; strengthen the judiciary, and promote human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BURUNDI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports of Heavy Fighting in the South</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days of heavy fighting between rebels and government forces in Rutana province led the International Medical Corps (IMC) to evacuate six of its staff to Bujumbura on May 4. On April 27, rebels allegedly killed 36 students and seven staff, and wounded another 34, in Buta, near Rutana. During the last week, rebel attacks reportedly took place along National Route 3, which runs north and south of Rumonge, in Bururi province. There are also reports of recent fighting in Makamba town, capital of Makamba province. The fighting in southern Burundi is noteworthy because Rutana, Bururi, and Makamba provinces have traditionally been quiet and in the Buyoya government's firm control. On May 2 in Mutambu, Bujumbura Rural province, a car exploded when it went over an anti-tank mine, killing a Swiss nun and the Burundian driver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regroupment Policy Criticized</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African leaders at the April 16 Arusha summit called for the disbandment of the regroupment camps, which the Buyoya government began in Karuzi province in March 1996. The practice has spread to Bujumbura Rurale, Bururi, Makamba, Kayanza, Cibitoke, Bubanza, and Muramvya over the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 21, the State Department criticized the Buyoya government's regroupment policy for the second time in one month. Its statement described the U.S. Ambassador's visit to camps in Kayanza and Karuzi provinces in the previous week, where he encountered malnutrition and disease. The USG will provide humanitarian assistance to the regroupment camps only under the following conditions: Aid will not be given immediately upon the formation of the camps; a needs assessment must precede any assistance; aid will be restricted to limited and temporary emergency work; and humanitarian workers' safety and freedom of movement must be guaranteed during the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 28, the WFP temporarily halted distribution of BHR/Food For Peace (FFP) P.L. 480 emergency Title II food to the Karuzi regroupment camps because the military governor of the province had repeatedly failed to allow the WFP to conduct an assessment. The food shipments, destined for about 74, 000 people in six regroupment camps in the province, resumed after the governor accepted that distributions would be based strictly on need, after thorough assessments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buyoya Shuffles Cabinet</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 4, Major Pierre Buyoya, the Burundian leader, replaced six ministers and changed the portfolios of three others. The most important posts of defense, interior, foreign affairs, and constitutional reform remain unchanged. The cabinet shuffle is the first since Buyoya named his government last August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Border Tensions with Tanzania</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buyoya sent a delegation, led by his health minister, to Tanzania on May 3- 4 to discuss border security with Tanzanian president Benjamin Mkapa. A Burundian military spokesman claimed on May 5 that Burundian rebels based in Tanzania had caused 3,000 peasants to flee their homes and take refuge in government buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 400,000 Refugees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of April 1, Tanzania was host to 368,000 refugees, according to the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs (UNDHA). Of the total, about 90,000 were Zairians and 278,000 were Burundians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Nyaragusu, some 3,000 Zairians, many of whom originate from the Uvira region, are registered to return to Zaire, and 1,000 of their compatriots from Lugufu have also requested permission to return. To date, about 5,000 Zairians have reportedly returned to Uvira on their own. In recent weeks, the number of Zairian arrivals has dramatically dwindled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent fluctuations in the number of Burundian refugees into and out of Tanzania are largely the result of fighting in the Ngara refugee camps in Tanzania, along the northern border of Burundi, and fighting in Bururi and Makamba provinces in southern Burundi. Unrest in the Tanzanian camps led 6, 025 refugees to return to Burundi between March 1 and April 24, while on April 28 alone, about 7,000 Burundians entered Tanzania after fleeing unrest in southern Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wounded Burundians in Kigoma hospital</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 61 wounded Burundians, were admitted to the hospital in Kigoma after they fled fighting in Burundi, a Tanzanian newspaper reported on May 5.  According to the account, in which several of the wounded were quoted, some of the victims were caught in crossfire between Burundian army (FAB) troops and rebels in Makamba and Bururi provinces. Others had been singled out by FAB soldiers, who suspected them of disloyalty.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Text of questions and answers by State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns on Zaire at the Department's daily briefing May 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: You want to swing over to Zaire and let us know if Kinshasa is about to fall or whatever?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Okay, Barry, what I can tell you is that we hope very much that the South African Government's proposal to have President Mobutu and Mr.  Kabila meet on a South African naval vessel on Wednesday, we hope that that meeting is held. We hope that the two leaders can agree on a peaceful transition in Zaire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been a lot of turbulence over the weekend, a lot of rumors in Kinshasa. Because of the uncertainty in Zaire, Ambassador Simpson, the United States Ambassador to Zaire, has decided to reduce American staff further at our embassy in Kinshasa from 37 people to 25. So we are down to a core of 25 people. Most of the people have left overnight by ferry to Brazzaville, by commercial aircraft to other African capitals and to Europe. We think this is a prudent move given the fact that fighting is drawing nearer to Kinshasa.  The security situation is stable today. Our embassy does not report anything untoward today, but you never know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are taking all appropriate precautions to safeguard the official Americans in Zaire. We continue to ask the private American community, which numbers still roughly 300 people, John?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: Three hundred twenty-five.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Three hundred twenty-five people, we urge those people to leave - business people, NGO's, missionaries. The situation is too precarious, too unstable for them to stay. We have a travel advisory out to that effect, and we reaffirm that today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: It sounds like over 120 people have left in the last week or two.  Is that about right?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Official Americans?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: No, as I recall, the last time I looked at this, there were 440 of all stripes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: That's right, roughly. We don't have specific numbers, George, at least not right now. But I think that's true that the numbers have declined. That is a good thing. People ought not to take chances in a situation like this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, we hope that the transfer of power is going to be peaceful, but that is not certain. The rebel army continues to march towards the capital. It is unclear whether or not this meeting will be held on Wednesday. It is unclear what the Zairian Army in Kinshasa will do, currently in its barracks. It doesn't have a great track record about civil law and order in the past. We are mindful of that. There have been a lot of rumors over the weekend, as you know, including some rumors that the Zairian Government was prepared to kill expatriates in order to draw in foreign intervention forces. Now, we don't believe that rumor was true, but we have a responsibility to take it seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we have taken some very significant security precautions over the weekend, and we have asked these people to leave. So we're down to 25 official Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: What about the rumors of looting in the capital?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: We saw the reports today, but our embassy has not reported anything like that. They report a quiet city. But it is a big city, so I'm not sure they know everything that is happening all around the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Would you say these rumors are partially responsible for this draw-down of a dozen or so?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: It's certainly one of the factors, but not the only factor, yes.  We have a fundamental responsibility to protect our people. As you know, Secretary Albright has been watching this daily. She's asked for a daily report on the security situation at our embassy in Kinshasa for two and a half, three weeks now. We just feel, given the fact that the endgame is approaching in Zaire, the transfer of power is going to happen one way or the other, we ought to be down to the absolute minimum number of people that Ambassador Simpson needs to run his embassy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are going to keep the embassy open, obviously as long as possible. We would like to keep it open because the United States ought to be represented when the transition occurs. Laura?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: The number of private Americans in the country still seems to be fairly high given these rumors that you have referred to surfacing over the weekend. Is there some other effort, you know, beyond your making the call from the podium and encouraging Americans to leave there or not to travel there at all? Are there any phone calls going out from the embassy to encourage the Americans to leave before it becomes a situation where an evacuation might be necessary?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Well, we have encouraged American citizens to leave for many months. We are not in a position to force American citizens to leave Zaire.  Each American has to make his or her own decision about their own personal welfare. There are missionaries there who believe, obviously, that they are doing necessary work. There are business people there who are chasing profits, chasing contracts, and obviously they and their companies have decided it is worth the risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We think it is a high risk, frankly. In a situation like this, in a country like this where you have a major, potent rebel force which is marching on the capital; where you have a rather undisciplined central government Army with a very poor track record in its barracks in Kinshasa, we cannot predict what is going to happen. So our message is clear as a bell to the American private community -- get out of Zaire. Get out of Zaire before you find yourself in harm's way. They ought to listen to that message.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - Namibia's bid to have its elephant population downgraded at the upcoming CITES conference has received a significant boost with a major wildlife organisation giving support to Namibia's proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traffic, the wildlife trade monitoring programme of the WWF World Wide Fund for Nature and the World Conservation Union, has announced its qualified backing for the proposals of Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species summit takes place in Harare, Zimbabwe, in June.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hoping to end the seven-year international commercial trade ban in elephants and elephant products, the three SADC countries have petitioned CITES to move their elephant populations from Appendix I to Appendix II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Traffic recommends that the 136-country strong Convention accept the three southern African proposals but impose a zero quota for trade in ivory from each country, and for trade in elephant hides from Zimbabwe,&quot; a statement from Traffic said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reputable conservation organisation said this would allow trade in live animals and hunting trophies, &quot;but not in elephant ivory or hides for the time being&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although it is premature for ivory to be traded now, it's clearly time to reward good conservation,&quot; said Tom Milliken, the Director of Traffic's programme for east and southern Africa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe, the elephant is an abundant species and clearly does not meet the criteria for the highest level of protection under CITES.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traffic's decision comes in the wake of a CITES-commissioned report by a Panel of Experts which found that the three countries' elephant populations did not meet the biological criteria for continued listing on Appendix I, which prohibits international commercial trade in endangered species.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Limited trade in live animals and sport hunting trophies and other products in the future would help Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe recoup part of their considerable investment in conserving elephant populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All countries have undertaken to return revenues to local communities living among elephants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traffic noted that the cost of elephant protection and management was high, estimated at US$200 per square kilometre, &quot;a burden most African countries bear alone with great difficulty&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Namibia is highly commended by Traffic, which said the country had passed all the precautionary requirements for its elephant populations to be transferred to Appendix II, according to the CITES report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Traffic said, Botswana needed to improve its control over ivory stocks, while Zimbabwe needed stricter implementation of domestic controls on trade in ivory. &quot;Both countries have asked Traffic to help put corrective measures in place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the importing side, the CITES panel found domestic ivory trade controls in Japan to require improvements at the retail level in order to prevent the infiltration of ivory products from illegal sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traffic, in a recently released report on domestic ivory trade controls in Asia, confirmed this finding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once Botswana, Zimbabwe and Japan addressed the concerns noted in the CITES report, Traffic said it believed trade in ivory could resume subject to strict regulatory measures. The London-based Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) has come out vehemently against the three countries' bid to have the elephant downlisted and is mustering opposition to the move ahead of the CITES meeting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BAMAKO, Mali (PANA) - President Alpha Oumar Konare has virtually been assured of a second term in Office as President of Mali, after winning more than 85 percent of the votes cast in polls held Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Konare, who ran on the ticket of the Alliance for Democracy in Mali (ADEMA) secured 85.15 percent of the vote, according to provisional results released by the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI) Tuesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mamadou Maribatourou Diaby, leader of the Party for Unity, Development and Progress (PUDP), won 4.09 percent of the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remaining votes were shared by the candidates of other opposition parties which boycotted the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The voter turn-out rate was 27 percent and the provisional results do not include polling stations in Konare's native region of Kayes, as well as Sikasso and the fourth commune of the Bamako district, where vote counting has been delayed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malian opposition parties said Monday that it would not recognize the legitimacy of a president elected from Sunday's ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement released to the national news agency (AMAP), the parties said they were happy with &quot;the low turn-out in polling stations and the voters response to the call for a peaceful boycott of the May 11 electoral masquerade&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Konare has in the course of his campaigns said if he won, he would include members of the opposition in a broad-based government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the Malian constitution, the president is elected for a five- year renewable term of office.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUBUMBASHI, Zaire (PANA) - The war being waged by Laurent Kabila's rebel forces, who have vowed to topple President Mobutu Sese Seko has generated unprecedented anxiety among Zairians in Lubumbashi, the country's second largest city and capital of the mineral-rich Shaba Region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two million or so Lubumbashi residents, like their compatriots elsewhere in the vast Central African region regard Kabila's current offensive against Mobutu as the only chance to end his 32 years of exploitation that has turned the country into one of the poorest on the African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mobutu Ni Mwizi. Tunataka Kabila Amukamate. (Mobutu is a thief, We want Kabila to catch him,&quot; Mwamba Ngoy told PANA in Swahili in Lubumbashi in an interview recently.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngoy, 37, a mining engineer by profession, was speaking for what he said were thousands of fellow Zairean university graduates thrown out of employment due to Mobutu's neglect of the national economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like many ordinary Zaireans in Lubumbashi, he ekes out a living by doing odd jobs, including vending an assortment of merchandise and foodstuff brought across the borders, mainly from neighbouring Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This man (Mobutu) is a devil. He has reduced Zaireans to paupers when our country is supposed to be among the richest in Central Africa and the continent because of our vast mineral wealth,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngoy says he monitors Kabila's war against Mobutu launched in 1996 almost &quot;centimeter by centimeter&quot;. &quot;I want Mobutu to go quickly for Kabila to take over and end this deprivation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lubumbashi residents have a reason to be excited about Kabila's entry. He has already taken steps to redress people's suffering in the &quot;liberated areas&quot; including parts of Lubumbashi itself, which currently serves as the headquarters of his Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of the Congo (Zaire) or AFDL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has ordered reduction of the exchange rate of the New Zaire, the local currency, against the United States dollar from 400,000 to 140,000 per dollar. Similar exchange readjustments have been ordered in other liberated areas including Kisangani (80,000 NZ) and Kasai (60,000NZ) per dollar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The measure is intended to help lower the country's import bill particularly of essential foodstuff and other commodities and hence the high cost of living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bread, in Lubumbashi, for example, now costs an average of 200,000NZ from between 500,000 NZ and even 600,000NZ before Kabila's orders. Other foodstuff such as mealie meal, milk, sugar and commodities like charcoal have had their prices reduced by half. The same goes for public transport service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The price decrease has, however, not been of much benefit to most Lubumbashi residents due to the high levels of unemployment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now we want Kabila to bring in investors to rehabilitate our mines and open up others for us to get jobs, said Kasongo Wamwanza, a cobbler along the dilapidated Mobutu Street in the city centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila has since signed contracts with various firms, especially from the United States, Europe and South Africa to invest in the country's gold, diamond, copper cobalt and other mines which AFDL officials say are currently operating at less than 10 percent capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, he received a delegation representing 32 foreign business houses organised by America Mineral Fields Incorporated, to finance mining operations in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Kabila's economic and finance minister, Mawapanga Mwanananga, it is intended that full mining production will be attained in the next two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are in a hurry here. President Kabila is a no nonsense man. He wants to get all Zaireans back to work because we realize that this is the only way we can turn around the fortunes of this great country, Mwanananga told PANA in Lubumbashi recently. Similar sentiments were expressed by his mines counterpart Florent Kambale Kabila Mututulo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of Zaire's minerals are currently mined by the government-owned Gecamines Company mainly based in Shaba Province. It employs an estimated 36,000 workers and is regarded as the country's highest employer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other state mining companies include Miba which is mainly engaged in diamond exploitation in the Kasai Region and Kilomoto, which deals in gold in Kisangani. All the regions are under the control of the AFDL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFDL officials say that there are no reliable mineral production and revenue records for Zaire's mining industry. These are now currently being compiled by Mututulo's ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu is alleged to have been privately selling Zaire's minerals to make a personal fortune estimated to be in billions of dollars at the expense of his 45 million subjects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now they look up to Kabila to share the wealth equally among all Zaireans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Come back tomorrow and you will find Congo and the Congolese changed,&quot; said Ngoy as he went off to listen to Kabila's radio broadcasts on &quot;La Voix Du Peuple&quot; (the Voice of the People) as the AFDL soldiers advance towards the capital, Kinshasa, to dislodge the ailing 66-year-old Mobutu from power.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambia on Tuesday stated that it now supports the ban in ivory trade enforced in 1992 under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in Lusaka, the country tourism minister, Amusaa Mwanamwambwa, said the government had reversed the position that was adopted in 1989 against the listing of the African elephant as an endangered species.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwanamwambwa was officially opening a preparatory national workshop on the forthcoming 10th CITES conference scheduled for June 9-20 in Harare, Zimbabwe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To prevent the slaughter of its dwindling elephant population, he said, the government of President Frederick Chiluba is opposed to the resumption of trade in ivory and elephant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African elephant is listed under Appendix I of the convention, banning trade in ivory and other parts, to boost the elephant's dwindling population on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwanamwambwa stressed that Zambia would not support a lifting of the ban which is sought by some neighbouring Southern African states, saying this would open the &quot;floodgates of senseless elephant slaughter due to demand for ivory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the decision was taken after the government noted a sharp decline in Zambia's elephant population from about 250,000 in the early 1960s. This had dropped to 100,000 by 1975 and between 22,000 and 24,000 at present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the elephant population had suffered from severe depletion due to poaching which he said was prompted by illegal trade in ivory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister said Zambia had also decided to review its position on the listing of African elephant on Appendix I to allow the elephant population to reach verifiable recovery. Appendix I listing of the CITES convention calls for trade prohibition in ivory and other endangered species.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe have been calling for the repeal of the ban on ivory trade so that they could &quot;sell&quot; their excess elephants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwanamwambwa said while he did appreciate the sentiments of the neighbors, Zambia still felt that the ban should be maintained to save some of its own elephant populations which occasionally wander within the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most of our African elephant range forms a continuous ecosystem spreading across our common political borders,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the major challenge is to evaluate the movement of elephants across national boundaries, control of illegally obtained ivory and reducing conflict between human beings and elephants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe have submitted proposals to the UN Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, seeking the re- opening international trade in ivory, by &quot;down-listing&quot; their elephants from Appendix 1 to Appendix 11 of the convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A decision on the proposals is expected to be made at the forthcoming conference in Harare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservationists from all over Africa and Asia are voicing concern that if the international ivory trade is re-opened, large scale elephant poaching will resume.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These argue that say that there is evidence that poaching is increasing and ivory is being stockpiled by smugglers in anticipation of an increase in ivory prices once the ban is lifted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well over 500 tons of ivory are now estimated to be stored in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overriding concern of parties to CITES is that there should never be a return to the situation in the 19970s and 1980s when illegal ivory trade overwhelmed legal trade and Cites controls which was proved totally inadequate to prevent illegal ivory entering legal trade.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Bomb experts were on Tuesday still analyzing fragments from Monday's explosion in Nigeria's western city of Ibadan, suspected to be a bomb planted by dissidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Assistant Inspector-General of Police, Hassan Alli-Jos, said it was after the meeting that the police could determine the nature of the device, which went off as top military officers were heading for a seminar several kilometres away from a barracks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The explosion, which occurred at a junction on the Eleyele-Jericho road, ripped through the police truck conveying soldiers and policemen to work, witnesses said. No death occurred but two soldiers and a policeman were injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The device also smashed the windscreen of a white Mercedes Benz car, owned by one Banji Adeleke, who is being questioned by the police in connection with the blast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adeleke's car was said to be behind the police truck when the explosion occurred. The Oyo state administrator, Col. Ahmed Usman, has visited the scene, accompanied by the state director of security service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Usman was quoted as having described the perpetrators as &quot;cowards,&quot; who were out &quot;to embarrass the government because of a few dollars and pounds.&quot; He pledged that government would track down those behind the act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Present at the seminar organised by defence headquarters, were Nigeria's Chief of Defence staff, Maj.-Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, the Chiefs of Army and Naval Staff, and other senior military officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Wednesday, a bomb went off in Lagos, the sixth such explosion in Nigeria's economic hub in the last seven months, all but one of them targeted at the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria's military government has accused pro-democracy groups in the country of being behind the explosions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sixteen people, including exiled Nigerian Nobel Literature Laureate, Wole Soyinka, are facing charges in connection with the explosions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The new Labour government in Britain has frozen its Aid and Trade Provisions (ATP) scheme worldwide to allow the recently appointed minister to review it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman of the ATP Harare office told the Zimbabwe Inter-African News Agency (Ziana) the new British minister, Clare Short, heading the department of International Development, needed to look at the existing policy of the scheme.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All ATP projects are on hold until the new minister in the United Kingdom has considered her position,&quot; said the spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Short took over from Baroness Lynda Chalker as head of the former Overseas Development Agency (ODA) after a landslide victory by Tony Blair's Labour Party, which ended 18 years of Conservative Party rule in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Zimbabwe, the freezing of the scheme will affect two projects -- the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) 'Land Rover&quot; vehicle deal and supply of equipment to the National University of Science and Technology (NUST).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior British official told Ziana in Harare that the new minister was &quot;not overly keen on the ATP scheme,&quot; under which funds were allocated to projects British companies with a strong commercial orientation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the scheme, the Zimbabwe police was expected to get at least 1,500 Land Rovers, supplied by a British firm. The contract's cost was to be paid by ODA, in the form of a 35 percent grant and 65 percent loan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Land Rover deal was valued at 25 million pound sterling, equivalent to 19.7 million U.S dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ATP scheme is a good project and will have to be put before the minister,&quot; the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were no details available on the value of the NUST educational equipment deal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ethiopian News Agency (ENA) on Tuesday quoted Ali Boyina, a representative of the Afar People Democratic Organization, as saying the desperate girls shot, hanged or threw themselves into rivers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA, Uganda (PANA) - Although Uganda's economy is considered to be among the best performers in Africa, its risk rating has not been improving fast enough to match the score.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pearl of Africa - the name given to Uganda by Winston Churchill - is still seen as more risky than the African average, and much more risky than some of the countries most notorious with investors, such as Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is contained in a commentary on the Ugandan economy written by Paul Collier an economics professor at The centre for the Study of African Economies at Oxford University. In a report prepared for the European Union, Collier says a recent survey of investor attitudes to Uganda identified risk as the most deterrent to private investment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey, conducted for the World Bank found that of the different types of risk identified in Uganda, non-commercial risk was the largest component. Within this category, it was fears of policy reversal which was dominant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1987, just as Yoweri Museveni's National Resistance Movement government came to power, Uganda had the worst rating of the 25 African countries then rated. By September 1989, this rating had further deteriorated to just 4.5 on a scale ranging from 0 to 100.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It recovered slightly, only to fall back to 5.2 as of September 1992, against the lowest of the 29 African countries then rated. From then to March 1996 (the most recent rating), progressive and rapid up-rating, now standing at 14.5 This up-rating has coincided with a large increase in both private capital inflows and private investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a relationship across countries between the risk ratings and private investment: risk deters investment. Collier says in his commentary that the rising risk rating is gradually introducing Uganda into the world capital market, so that, as long as the rating does not deteriorate, the capital flows should be reasonably secure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An implication is that Uganda has not really harnessed private capital inflows on the scale which is to be expected in the next decade,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is because, despite the remarkable improvement in the ratings, Uganda is still rated as far more risky than seems warranted by its current performance as the star among African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is sill rated as one of the world's most risky economies. Of the 34 African countries now rated, only eight have lower ratings. The Kenyan rating has never been below 18.1 and currently stands at 30 in contrast to the Ugandan rating of 14.5. Uganda is thus still more risky than the African average, and much more risky than some of the countries most notorious with investors, such as Nigeria&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British economist attributes this to information lagging behind events. &quot;Given the sustained fast growth rate, the sustained low inflation and the successful election, all of which compare favourably with Kenya, it does not seem to be so obviously a higher risk environment than Kenya,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing an investors forum organised by the Uganda Investment Authority (UIA) in Brussels in April 1995, Collier said Uganda was regarded as risky despite its economy being the best performing in Africa partly because of ignorance of Uganda on the part of the international business community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three foremost facts about Uganda thrust upon the international community by the media are probably Amin, AIDS and proximity to Rwanda.  Although there has been some media coverage of the recent good economic and political performance, wars are more media worthy than economies, so that this has been offset by reports of fighting in the north of the country, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thus (mis) informed, businesses make the entirely reasonable calculation that it is not worth incurring the high costs (which are mainly opportunity costs) of learning more. Hence Uganda seldom gets on the short list of investors and so they never incur the costs which would make them better informed,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On average, African countries are rated as being significantly more risky than warranted by objective circumstances. Uganda is probably currently a victim of this phenomenon. This low rating cannot simply be overcome by advertising Uganda's achievements (although this will undoubtedly help), Collier said even when they learn of these achievements, investors tend to react by prognoses that they are not sufficiently likely to persist: either the country could relapse into an economic control regime or even into civil wars, presumably, the risk rating agencies know the basic economic facts but are skeptical of their persistence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said dealing with the fear of relapse is much more difficult than dealing with ignorance of present conditions. If the businesses can be persuaded to digest a page of economic and political facts they can be dramatically disabused of their beliefs about the present conditions. By contrast, the fear of relapse is based not on superficial errors about Uganda but on extrapolation from experience elsewhere and from Uganda's own past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither of these extrapolations is intrinsically foolish, the professor said. About half of the liberalisations in African have been reversed and statistically, a past civil war is the single best predictor of a future civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government needs to be able to signal that the transition is more secure, which is different from advertising that it has taken place,&quot; Collier said. &quot;Somehow the country has to live down its past and dissociate itself from its neighbourhood. Unless this happens, the main foreign investment will be by the group which has an information advantage, namely, the returning Asians. The risks of economic policy reversal and of civil wars are to an extent distinct,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - South Africa's Deputy President Thabo Mbeki left Cape Town on Tuesday for what is being seen here as a final bid to ensure that the next scheduled round of Zairean peace succeed in securing a peaceful solution for the country's crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbeki's latest diplomatic shuttle to Zaire is aimed at ensuring that the next meeting between President Mobutu Sese Seko and Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila -- scheduled for Wednesday -- does take place.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters before his departure, Mbeki -- who has been the chief negotiator in international mediation efforts to end Zaire's seven-month civil war -- said that tomorrow's meeting was the last chance for a negotiated political settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think, he said, that as things stand we are in that kind of danger that the meeting on Wednesday may very well be the last chance to find a negotiated solution to this crisis. He added the warning that if the meeting did not take place as planned then in reality it opens the way to a military solution being the only option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the South African negotiators and United Nations and Organization of African Unity's special envoy Mahomed Sahnoun are consulting both sides in an effort to move to a position where the principal issues -- the timetable for President Mobutu to hand over power to a transitional authority, and the composition of that authority -- can be resolved tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are hoping,&quot; he said, &quot;that there will be sensitivity on both sides that it is better to enter into an agreement on this matter, rather than resorting at this final stage to the use of force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The talks are scheduled to begin tomorrow morning aboard the South African navy supply vessel, SAS Outeniqua, off the Congolese sea port of Pointe Noire.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - The Journalists Association of Namibia (JAN) has expressed concern at increasing intolerance of Namibian government officials towards the right to freedom of expression, including calls for restricting this right and attacks on the integrity of media practitioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JAN executive member Tom Minney said this May 9 in Windhoek at a function to mark this year's World Press Freedom Day, which JAN used to resubmit a petition handed to Namibian President Sam Nujoma, United Nations Secretary General Butros Butros-Ghali, UNESCO director General Federico Mayor and SADC secretary General Kaire Mbuende in 1994 in Windhoek on World Press Freedom Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petition, whose contents Minney said were considered still valid, called for an end to the harassment of journalists and respect of the right to freedom of expression by SADC governments and other UN member states. Minney called on the Namibian government to restrain its members from launching &quot;further unwarranted attacks on the media, educate its members about the indispensable role of a free, independent and pluralistic media in a democracy, and take urgent steps to encourage respect for the principles proclaimed in the Windhoek Declaration of Promoting an Independent and Pluralistic African Press.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In return, JAN pledged to continue to promote and uphold the &quot;highest attainable standards of journalistic ethics and practices&quot; among its membership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, the 1994 petition called for an end to the harassment and imprisonment of media workers by governments in the SADC region, creation of conditions which allow free, independent and pluralistic media to flourish, abolition of all forms of registration and/or licencing of journalists by governments and withdrawal of governments from running media councils and other bodies regulating the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, it called for the abolition of excessive taxes &quot;which hinder public access to media and thus the free-flow of information,&quot; ensure that state-owned media is run in the &quot;interest of the general public and not in the interests of those in power&quot;, and end to &quot;monopolistic control on the means of media production,&quot; actively encourage the establishment of community radio stations, and impress upon senior government officials and those in authority &quot;the need to be readily accessible to media workers, whoever they represent&quot; in order to facilitate the free-flow of information from government to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The journalists called upon the UN, UNESCO and other relevant bodies to hold accountable those responsible for violations of media freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, MISA's 1996 State of the Media report released on May 3, highlights three SADC countries as main offenders of media freedom in the region. The three include Namibia, others are Zambia and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - The Zambia Independent Media Council (IMC) has elected Justice Florence Mumba, a judge of the level of the Supreme Court, as its Chairperson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Mumba, who is the Ombudsman in Zambia, was elected at the Zambia Independent Media Council's (IMC) first meeting held in Lusaka on May 9.  Justice Mumba said soon after being elected that it was a good thing that the independent media had led the way in forming a self regulatory body for its journalists.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the onus was now on the IMC to instill confidence in the public by the decisions it will make. Father Ignatius Mwebe who is the Secretary General of the Catholic Secretariat was elected Vice Chairperson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other members of the council include an evangelist, Doctor Nevers Mumba of Victory Ministrie, lawyer John Sangwa of Simeza &amp; Sangwa Advocates, and Ms Aida Opoku-Mensah, Director of Panos Institute Center for Policy Debate in Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others are: Mr. Abbey Maine Managing Director of Palesa News Agency, Mr. Arthur Simuchoba, Executive Editor at the Post Newspaper and Mr.  Fackson Banda, an author and Director of Information at the Christian Council of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IMC was initiated by members of the Zambia Independent Media Association (ZIMA/MISA Zambia) early this year, in response to threats by the government of President Frederick Chiluba to impose a legislated media council. One of the main objectives of the IMC is to uphold and maintain the freedom of the media in Zambia, including the freedom of expression and the right of the public to receive information free from interference or intimidation from any source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IMC will also assist in ensuring that the media adhere to the highest professional standards by strict compliance with the code of ethics. Among the procedures laid down is that the hearing of the IMC shall be open to the public unless there is something &quot;not for public interest&quot; especially in the gathering of evidence. &quot;But all findings/decisions must be made public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the functions of the IMC shall include receiving complaints from the public, investigating and coming up with a verdict. The IMC is also empowered to make an order for correction in a manner determined by the IMC, or reconcile the parties without any further action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IMC shall undertake an investigation into any matter of public importance concerning the conduct and output of ZIMA members. If an organisation or individual is dissatisfied with the decision of the IMC they can appeal to the general meeting of ZIMA through the Chairman, David Simpson.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - COSATU PRESS STATEMENT ON THE PROTEST ACTION IN FURTHERANCE OF DEMANDS ON BASIC CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT BILL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COSATU held a special EXCO on 12 May 1997 in the wake of the Labour Appeal Court's ruling on the protest action which was scheduled for 12 May 1997. The meeting rejected the majority judgment made by the Labour Court on the protest action planned for Monday 12th May 1997. It took note of the fact that this was not a unanimous judgment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the judgment, the two judges whose majority view is the decision of the court, found that COSATU had complied with the provisions of section 77 (1) save for section 77 (1)(c) which provides that the matter giving rise to the dispute be considered by NEDLAC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Nicholson on the other hand, found that COSATU had complied with section 77 (1) in all respects. He further criticised Business South Africa for its conduct in NEDLAC, for introducing red herrings, for claiming it had no mandate, and for evading the issues raised by COSATU. In particular, he found it &quot;strange&quot; that BSA claimed to have no mandate in meetings held in April 1997, on matters which had been the subject of negotiations for a period of more than one year. The same applies to government whom despite negotiations on the Green Paper and the Bill, gave the impression that this is a new process altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EXCO reiterated the view that since the release by the government of the green paper on employment standards in February 1996, numerous meetings had taken place. In fact COSATU has attended more than 11 formal meetings at Nedlac and a large number of bilaterals with both business and government. In this regard, we reject the argument that the issues giving rise to the protest action had not been considered and that the onus was on COSATU to ensure that the issue was considered by NEDLAC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As regards the negotiations it was reported that there had been no meaningful proposals and movement by the other parties in NEDLAC on the core issues. In fact business is said to have told the meeting that their positions are the same as reflected in their founding document of last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are also rejecting the 45 hour week for mining workers, domestic workers, agricultural workers and security workers. They would want the phasing in to be left to collective bargaining rather than the bill.  They have placed an unacceptable model on variation on the table whose result will be that all rights can be varied down. They remain firm on three months unpaid maternity leave, have rejected the issue of family responsibility leave as well as payment for Sunday work. Consequently we remain in deadlock on the core issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After careful consideration, the COSATU EXCO resolved as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. It is clear that there is a widening of the gap as well as a hardening of attitude by business and the government (on certain core issues) in the negotiations. 2. Reiterated it's position on the following core issues manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Paid maternity leave COSATU's position remains that the law must provide for six months maternity leave of which at least four months should be paid. (That women who go on maternity leave should enjoy job security as well as the fact that in the event that the UIF is used as a mechanism for payment, women who lose their jobs soon after returning from maternity leave should not lose on the UIF benefits.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Hours of work COSATU has maintained throughout the negotiations that while there are some improvements in working hours in so far as there is a reduction (phased in in certain sectors) in working hours for security workers, farm workers, domestic and mining workers, the bill makes no provision for a phased approach to a legislated 40 hour working week. Consequently, our demand remains that the bill should provide for a 40 hour working week phased in over a period of not more that 5 years.  The approach in the negotiations by government and business on the 45 hours for mining workers, farm workers, domestic workers and security workers means that even where we thought that there was a gain for such workers it has vanished into thin air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Sunday Work -- COSATU proposed that the status quo of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act in respect of pay for work performed on a Sunday, be extended to all workers. This would provide that workers who work for less than 4 hours will receive a full day's salary, while those who work for more than 4 hours would be paid at double the rate.  Further, that workers who elect to take a day in lieu of Sunday work should be paid at time and a half. Business's attitude to Sunday being regarded as a day of rest and consequently double payment, means that we are now in deadlock on this issue as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Child labour -- The COSATU position is that while we welcome the definition of a child in the bill, we remain of the view that the threshold for prohibition on child labour should be 18 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Variation -- COSATU is opposed to the variation model in the bill in so far as it seeks to allow for downward variation of certain rights, the wide discretionary powers given to the minister to vary rights downwards and the provision for individual agreements to change the provisions of the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. To ratify the NOB's proposal to postpone the action of 12 May 1997 to the 2nd of June 1997. The form of the action will be a 24 hour strike. This is because of the widening of the gap in the negotiations as well as their hardening of attitudes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. To condemn both the government and business on the approach they took to the discussions of the issues raised by COSATU in our letters of 18 February 1997 as well as the one of 21 April 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. To mandate the NOB's to approach our lawyers to seek legal opinion and to mandate them to apply for leave to appeal against the constitutional findings in the judgment and the right to appeal to the Constitutional Court in respect of those findings. It has also been agreed to run a petition amongst our members. ( see attached )</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Mandate regional structures to hold discussions with progressive formations to win their support for our demands including those ANC members who serve in the NCOP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Mandate NOB's to seek an urgent meeting with the ANC parliamentary caucus to appraise them of our positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Mandate the NOB's to inform the Alliance and other progressive formations of our positions as well as our revised programme of action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - The Times of Swaziland today, May 13, reports threats by Senate to close it for reporting in its May 12 edition, that King Mswati owed the Mbabane City Council Elangeni 30,000 (US$6,382), in unpaid rates for a hotel he owns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Times quotes Senator Bhekimpi Dlamini, a member of the royal family, as threatening to sponsor a motion to close the newspaper. &quot;We are bringing a motion here. What can prevent us from closing down this newspaper?&quot; the Times quotes Dlamini telling the senate May 12.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper reports further that the Senate voted to discuss the matter in a parliamentary caucus where Dlamini said he would raise issues to be investigated by the Minister of Public Service and Information Muntu Mswane, before the motion was brought to parliament. &quot;I want the minister to investigate this as it is not the first time the newspaper has written such an article. My anger is so extensive that I am prepared to die for this. The newspaper should have stated that the person owing the rates is Kal Grant,&quot; the Times quotes Dlamini telling the Senate before the caucus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Times editor Mashumelo Twalo told MISA May 13, Senate had over- reacted to the story because it was embarrassing to the King, but he hoped with time the Senators would look at the issue soberly. &quot;It is difficult to say if they will carry out their threat, I hope they will ultimately cool down. Right now emotions are running quite high because we dared write about the King,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A reporter on the Times, Nkululeko Dlamini, told MISA in a separate interview it was ironic that the Senate had taken offence with the present story, when last year a related story about the King buying the hotel from businessman Kal Grant at Elangeni 8 million (US$1.9 million) went without comment from any of the Senators. He further said the story was not disrespectful of the King, besides, the newspaper had an obligation to inform the public. &quot;In this case, the King is more of a businessman than a monarch. We reported that he had bought the property and if he owes rates, it is our obligation to disclose that,&quot; Dlamini said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last August, the Times of Swaziland reported moves by the ruling monarch to close it after a series of articles alleging official corruption, however, the government denied this.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pretoria - Text of an address by South African Minister of Provincial Affairs and Constitutional Development Valli Moosa on May 11 to a gathering of civic educators in Pretoria sponsored by the United States Information Agency: (Begin text as prepared for delivery)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairperson, honored guests, ladies and gentlemen -- it is indeed an honor and privilege for me to be addressing a gathering of so many luminaries as I have noticed when I looked at the guests list. It is a special honor for me to be addressing you on the eve of what I think would be a very important conference for this region and the African continent. On behalf of the South African government I wish to express appreciation to the United States Information Service, the Institution for a Democratic South Africa and members of CIVITAS for what is indeed a most welcome initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa is a particularly interesting laboratory I think when it comes to the question of civic education. We had begun what I consider to be a rather unique process of civic education over the past few years. For us it was not a case of drafting a democratic constitution and then going about to educate the public about why this constitution is so good and why people should be loyal to the constitution and respect it. We had started in a sense at an earlier stage.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first step was to go out to the public and talk about why a constitution would be a useful thing for this society to have and then to talk about what should be in this constitution. And therefore we had designed the entire constitution-making process in this country in a manner that would involve the public and a broader society as much as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first thing we had done is that we had thrown (open) every meeting of the constitutional assembly which had taken place over the past two years and every meeting of the constitutional negotiations which had taken place prior to 1994 open to the public. Not a single meeting was held behind close doors and even meetings of the management committee of the constitutional assembly -- the management committee was made up of about 10 of us -- was open to the public. So we had more observers at that meeting than members of the meeting which took place on a weekly basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We'd also called on members of the public to write to the constitutional assembly indicating what in their view should be in the constitution. And we received literally thousands upon thousands of written submissions from members of the public. And I must say here not only from constitutional experts, lawyers and law professors, but just members of the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also realized that a very large number of South Africans would not have the confidence or perhaps the ability to put down the ideas on paper and send it off to the constitutional assembly. Therefore, an important part of the process was what we refer to as the public participation program. We broke up the Constitutional Assembly into teams of members who held people's forums in various parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Particularly in the rural areas, in the informal settlements and in those parts of the country where we knew that literacy perhaps was not as high as it should be. And at these forums, members of the public were invited and constitutional assembly members were tasked just with the duty of sitting up front on the stage and listening to what people had to say. The format of those forums was such that there were no speeches, no inputs at all. The meeting opened with a request to the audience to say whatever they wanted to the constitutional assembly who had taken notes. And that in itself was a part from a process of consultation, I believe, was an important element of the beginning of civic education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In drafting the constitution, we had then decided that it should be written in plain language; that there was absolutely no reason why a constitution should be written in legalese. And therefore we had drafted every clause of the constitution in plain language. We did everything that was possible to draft a short constitution -- not a very lengthy document -- so that it was possible for people to actually read it. And immediately after drafting the constitution we translated it into all 11 official languages that we have in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, we embarked upon National Constitution Week from the 17th to the 21st of March, during which week we sent every member of the Constitutional Assembly -- which is every member of parliament -- back to their home bases, to their constituencies, in order to themselves physically distribute copies of the constitution. And explain the contents of the constitution to people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Copies of the constitution were also made available -- every post office in the country -- it was distributed to members of the security forces, to the police services, at hospitals, at schools, other educational institutions -- we printed 7 million copies of the constitution. And I must tell you that such was the hunger and thirst for copies of the constitution that before the end of that week it was impossible to lay one's hands on a single copy. And we had complaints throughout the country that the post offices had run out of copies of the constitution -- some by midday on the first day of constitution week had run out of copies of the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African constitution has a number of safeguards built into the constitution. Checks and balances, if one may want to call it that.  The constitution cannot be easily amended by a simple majority in parliament. It establishes a number of constitutionally protected institutions like the Human Rights Commission; the Gender Commission; an independent electoral commission; public protector; an independent auditor general and, of course, an independent constitutional court.  Institutions aimed at protecting, safeguarding and upholding the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I must say that in my view that institutions provided for in a constitution do not in themselves build a democracy and constitutionally entrenched checks and balances are good enough when it comes to disputes that land up in court. But in the final analysis, it is the people of a country; a society which itself can make a constitution work, and can insure that the constitution endures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And this is the importance of civic education. That unless the people of South Africa hold the constitution close to their hearts, understand the constitution, and learn to love the values embodied in the constitution, we cannot be certain that the order would survive for generations to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it is for that reason that we are leaving no stone unturned when it comes to civic education. And I must say here that civic education and constitutional education is not just the preserve of government; that we are encouraging NGOs and other organizations and institutions in organs of civil society to participate fully in this program of constitution education. The task perhaps that we could play, is perhaps, coordinate and facilitate. But as all of you would know that there's no single interpretation of any constitution. And it is for that reason that it would be against the spirit of the constitution if we have a government line on what the constitution says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The constitution is not a mere statute. It's not just another very important act of parliament -- more important than other acts of parliament. And it's not simply a legal instrument in my view. Yes, it does serve to regulate the affairs of society; regulate matters between the state and between citizens, but I think it's much more than that. We view our constitution as a document which embodies the values of our society and the hopes and aspirations of the people of this country. The constitution grants inalienable rights to all citizens. But it also imposes duties, and in our own context it imposes, it grants both individual and collective rights. And it also imposes individual and collective duties. Everybody enjoys the freedom of expression, but everybody also has the duty to promote everybody else's freedom of expression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In conclusion, chairperson, I wish you well in your deliberations over the next few days and I hope that as you converse and debate and discuss how to deepen civic education in this country, on our continent and around the world, that you would at least get a whiff of the dawning of the African renaissance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Exiled African National Congress president Oliver Tambo sent a message to Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and other ANC leaders in the 1980s asking them to distance themselves from the practice of &quot;necklacing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was disclosed to the Truth Commission yesterday by Defence Minister Joe Modise during the ANC's second submission.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of Mr Tambo's appeal, Mrs Madikizela-Mandela was married to ANC leader Nelson Mandela, who was in jail. In April 1986, she drew strong local and international condemnation for a speech at Munsieville, outside Krugersdorp, during which she brandished a box of matches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, the ANC was questioned by the commission's chief legal adviser, Hanif Vally, about whether Mrs Madikizela-Mandela had been an ANC member at the time and whether she had been subject to party discipline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transport Minister Mac Maharaj confirmed that Mrs Madikizela-Mandela had been an ANC member and that the leadership in exile attempted to contact her in various ways from time to time. &quot;But the movement had extreme difficulty in establishing lines of communication,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details of the executions and the names of spies who took part in the infiltration, but were &quot;rehabilitated&quot; and/or released by the ANC, were given to the commission in Cape Town in a confidential appendix to the ANC's second submission yesterday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC was told its request to keep the names of the spies and agents secret put the TRC in &quot;an awkward position&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transport Minister Mac Maharaj said the ANC was highly sensitive about releasing the names of such people because their lives could be destroyed. &quot;This is not the type of information which should be just leaked without managing it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission chairman Desmond Tutu said the TRC would need to be persuaded to withhold the information. It would be discussed at a full TRC meeting on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Maharaj said the ANC leadership had been &quot;surprised&quot; by the level of infiltration. &quot;What we were facing was an extremely serious threat to the survival of our organisation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - One of the less intelligent things Thomas Jefferson said during his life was that travelling &quot;makes a man wiser but less happy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not so for Arie Katz and Susan Seely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contrary to Jefferson's aphorism, it seems that travel has made both these explorers wiser and a lot happier too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To put it another way, this is a good old-fashioned love story.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boy meets girl, they fall in love, get married, quit their jobs, sell their worldly goods, say goodbye to friends and set off to see the big, wide world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a real 20th century love story, you see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protagonists are corporate lawyer and a trade director and the setting is the city. Arie Katz met Susan Seely at a dinner in Washington DC in January, 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was studying law while Susan, having just completed her Masters in Middle Eastern studies in Seattle, was working part-time in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They really did fall in love and, as Arie puts it so succinctly: &quot;It's been one long date since then.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten days after they tied the knot on May 19 last year, the newlyweds left Boston on their epic journey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After visiting Hawaii, they travelled to Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Hong Kong, India, Dubai, Jordan, Israel - and they finally reached the shores of the Cape of Good Hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Arie it has been not just a physical journey but also one of rediscovering his roots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former South African (from Johannesburg) who emigrated to the United States in 1973, Arie studied law in Washington DC and has spent the past three years practising as a corporate attorney in a large Boston firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arie's paternal grandfather came to Port Elizabeth from Lithuania and became a stalwart of the Jewish community there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So when he visited the city it was a deeply nostalgic experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Part of this trip has been to learn more about my family. My grandfather died when I was only a year old and I was amazed to find his reputation was very much alive when I attended a Saturday morning service at a local synagogue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His great-grandparents ran a kosher hotel in Muizenberg and Arie still has memories of going to the synagogue in Muizenberg as a child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Susan is from Newport Beach in California and was the director of the Middle East and Africa for the Massachusetts Office of International Trade and Investment. This is her fourth visit to this country in three years, most of which were made on business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But why should two highly-successful professionals decide to embark on such an adventure?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arie explains: &quot;We had just had two of the worst winters in the history of Massachusetts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One day we just decided to quit our jobs, leave our flats and get married and then travel around the world. The world is really big and a year really short.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Susan has always had this wanderlust. I figured that if we travelled enough she'd be so tired she would just want to settle down. But that's not how it worked out ... we always find that there's a new place that we want to visit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next on the globetrotting couple's itinerary is England, after which they plan to visit Portugal, Gibraltar, Morocco and Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there's another unusual aspect to this sabbatical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As they've been criss-crossing the world, Arie and Susan have been keeping a chronicle of their travels and making it available on the internet for all to read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of particular interest to them as observant Jews has been the history and profiles of local Jewish communities, wherever they have visited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Susan has also been writing a regular column about their pilgrimage for a newspaper in Southern California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best part about the project, they say, is that it has generated interest wherever they have been and with more and more people offering information, it has evolved beyond what was originally envisaged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People have E-mailed us from around the world,&quot; said Arie. &quot;One couple read about us in the Jerusalem Report and gave us a list of people to contact in Portugal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arie and Susan have not restricted their research to Judaism but have also gleaned a lot about other religions and cultures en route.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Twelve people died and many were injured in a multiple vehicle pile-up on the N2 on Saturday which was caused in large measure by dense fog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By all accounts Saturday's horrifying multi-vehicle pile-up on the N2, in which 12 people burnt to death in a blazing inferno, was largely caused by dense fog, which was at its worst between Somerset West and Khayelitsha - exactly where the multiple collision took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inexplicably, traffic authorities apparently did nothing to to warn motorists of the treacherous conditions, and no special patrols were deployed, even though visibility had been reduced to only a few metres.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fog is hardly a rarity in the Western Cape, least of all in areas close to wetlands, and the fact that many cars, trucks and buses daily plough blindly into the thick of it on the N2 at speeds well in excess of their ability to stop suddenly in an emergency, ensured that at some stage a disaster was bound to occur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traffic police err in their duty if they fail to ensure that motorists stay well below normal speed limits in the sort of conditions that existed on the N2 on Saturday and they should be prepared to warn motorists throughout the province - by radio, through newspapers, and on the spot - of hazardous conditions on the roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illuminated warning boards drawing attention to mist and fog ahead and setting a safe speed limit, should become standard features on our roads. Such warning systems are widely used in other parts of the world where similar weather conditions exist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While traffic officials should urgently review their management of traffic in fog conditions, other public officials deserve high praise for their efforts during Saturday's tragedy. Metro rescue workers and firemen, assisted by many volunteers at the scene, showed great courage in their efforts to extract people from burning vehicles and in bringing the inferno under control in such a short time.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Barely a month after pulling off the continent's biggest privatisation deal to date by selling 30 percent of Telkom for $1,26- billion (about R5,54-billion), Public Enterprises Minister Stella Sigcau rolled out the Government's plans to put another five state-owned companies under the hammer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She briskly announced in Parliament last week that the privatisation of five State-owned companies with a joint turnover of R40-billion was expected to be completed or would near completion in the next 12 to 18 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The companies in which significant restructuring progress should be made were the Airports Company, Spoornet, Safcol, Aventura and Alexkor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new bill also would be tabled in Parliament to regulate the privatisation drive and the restructuring of State assets, added Ms Sigcau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa, the continent's economic leader, had been very careful to embrace privatisation so far, with the ruling class in the African National Congress only recently being prepared to use the &quot;p-word&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia, arguably the continent's foremost privatiser, moved into top gear earlier this year with the sale of Zambian Consolidated Copper Mines, the mining company which accounts for about 90 percent of its national export earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, the Ivory Coast, Uganda and Mozambique were among other countries that had opted to go on a privatisation spree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mood in South Africa has changed since with the sale of the 30 percent stake in Telkom to SBC Communications and Telekom Malaysia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Communications Minister Jay Naidoo said: &quot;Even though we have decided each restructuring will be done on a case-by-case basis, I think we've put into place a number of very important milestones in the Telkom process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Sigcau said Pretoria had embarked on the largest and most far- reaching process of restructuring State assets on the African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sale of the five State-owned companies now, according to Ms Sigcau, would bring South Africa up to speed with several other African countries where reformist governments had been pushing privatisation aggressively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sudden increased activity on South Africa's privatisation front comes as a bit of a surprise, although President Mandela referred to it when he mapped out economic reforms for the year ahead, including the imminent privatisation of key State assets, in his opening speech to Parliament at the beginning of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When President Mandela was released from jail, the African National Congress still had nationalisation &quot;of the commanding heights of the economy&quot; as a pillar of its economic strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC's new economic blueprint, the Growth, Employment and Redistribution (Gear) strategy, backed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, presses for a sweeping privatisation programme, deregulation and fiscal prudence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will be interesting to see though, while Ms Sigcau claims she has trade union backing, how the Congress of SA Trade Unions will respond to privatisation moves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Cosatu has formally pinned its colours to a nationalisation mast, it is also a signatory to the National Framework Agreement of January 25, 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This agreement between the ANC's alliance partners - Cosatu and the SA Communist Party - allows for a degree of privatisation under the label &quot;restructuring of State assets&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement attempts to strike a balance between the conflicting demands for continued State control and the need for &quot;restructuring of State assets&quot; to allow partnerships with, and sales to, private corporations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate between the ANC and its alliance partners is not over the whether there should be restructuring of state assets; rather, it is over what assets should be restructured, how and when this should be done and what safeguards should be built in to protect public-sector workers against retrenchments by private sector entrepreneurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosatu general secretary Sam Shilowa said some time ago: &quot;The goals of the RDP will be defeated if restructuring benefits a new black elite while the delivery of services is fundamentally undermined.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Sigcau said the Government's preferred method of privatisation was to seek a strategic equity partner for each of the companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unveiling the privatisation time-frames for the first time, Ms Sigcau told the National Assembly that an inter-ministerial cabinet committee had agreed that privatisation should also benefit historically disadvantaged businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government agreed to two policy objectives which would enable historically disadvantaged businesses and the 174 430 employees at the five State-owned enterprises to benefit directly from the enterprises' privatisation, said Ms Sigcau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To this end, shares in restructured State-owned companies would be sold at a discount to a National Empowerment Fund (NEF) which would be set up to empower historically disadvantaged communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Sigcau said it was the government's intention that funding schemes would be developed with the private sector to enable the disadvantaged to acquire shares in the NEF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The employees of privatised enterprises also would benefit through employee share ownership schemes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The share scheme will allow employees to purchase shares to the value of R10 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These principles have been accepted by the IMCC and will soon be discussed at the level of the portfolio committee and with labour and other stakeholders,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Aventura - the group of state holiday resorts - would be sold off completely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tender for the sale of Aventura holiday resorts to a consortium of companies specialising in holiday resorts and groups of historically disadvantaged investors, would be completed within the next 18 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the restructuring of Alexkor, which is involved in diamond mining in the Northern Cape, was a priority in order to inject fresh capital to fund exploration and development programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The restructuring process for Alexkor is at a fairly advanced stage and has taken into consideration the importance of the economic role it plays in Namaqualand.&quot; She anticipated that the restructuring process should be complete by the end of 1997 or early next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Safcol - the State company which runs commercial plantations - would be restructured by the end of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The restructuring of the Airports Company and South African Airways would be completed this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It had been acknowledged that in view of SAA's importance as a national asset and the highly competitive market within which it operated, its restructuring should be considered a priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SAA experienced a net loss of more than R300-million last year.  Ms Sigcau said the loss was attributed to fuel increases, increased foreign and local competition, the unfavourable rand-dollar exchange rate and industrial action by staff members at the SAA's technical division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SAA workforce had problems with morale and ways needed to be found to motivate them to be &quot;more patriotic concerning the airline&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turning to Eskom, Ms Sigcau said 1996 had seen an increase in payment levels from previously black local authorities, from 39 percent in 1995 to 62 percent last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amount of money owed to Eskom increased to R1 413-million in 1996 from R1 192-million in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eskom was on track with its aim to reduce the real price of electricity by 15 percent by the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since it had spelled out the commitment in 1994, the real reduction to date had been 8,1 percent, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation had set itself the target of electrifying 1 750 000 homes by the year 2 000 and since the start of its programme 1 259 520 homes had been electrified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eskom's success in providing electricity to hundreds of thousands of South Africans who were traditionally not considered part of the electricity market &quot;is a success we must look up to&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to Spoornet, Ms Sigcau said it had developed world market leadership over the years in the running of heavy-haul trains carrying minerals such as coal and iron ore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The technologies and competencies it had developed were not only sought after the world over, but they provided the company with a competitive tool that had the potential to carve out a niche for it in the global market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore Spoornet was in the process of bidding, in the context of local and international partners, for the operation of freight and heavy-haul systems in Brazil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Sigcau said one of the challenges her department had faced had been to nudge public enterprises to move from antiquated and authoritarian management styles and to embrace all the management levels that flowed from South Africa's new constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public enterprise committee had passed this year's budget &quot;not without reservations&quot; which included greater clarity on how the restructuring of enterprises was to serve black empowerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patricia de Lille of the Pan Africanist Congress said shares in some State assets, including Aventura and Safcol, could only be sold with the approval of Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms de Lille said she would call on parliament to put pressure on the government to table a bill &quot;within the next two or three months&quot; which spelled out who would implement the restructuring programme and what parliament's role would be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kobus Jordaan of the Democratic Party said privatisation would succeed only if the process was transparent, and quoted an economist saying that sale of equity to foreign investors could provide South Africa with more than R50-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DP called on the government to announce a policy on privatisation for the major state enterprises through a mixture of stock market listings and selling large stakes to strategic foreign investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The privatisation of large State enterprises could only boost the market's capitalisation by 20 to 25 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If foreign investors purchased only 20 percent, it would provide SA with an additional $8-billion (about R35,2-billion) to $10-billion (about R44-billion) in foreign investment, said Mr Jordaan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - There will be no plant closures following Frame's planned buyout of the other shareholders in Romatex, Frame chief executive Roy Sable has promised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week it was announced that CG Smith would sell its remaining 28 percent stake in Romatex to the Frame group, and that Frame would offer to buy out the minority shareholders, giving it sole ownership of Romatex and opening the way to rationalising the operations of the two groups.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Frame group took a controlling stake from CG Smith in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview yesterday, Mr Sable said management was &quot;still trying to make sense of the whole operation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Sable said the proposed buyout was triggered by continued losses at Romatex and the need to give Frame a free hand in rationalising operations. Initial rationalisation would target Romatex Home Textiles and Berg River Textiles, where there were common areas.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Xhosa-speaking people recently hired to operate telephones at Cape Town's 10111 police emergency radio control centre are on the verge of walking out because of alleged racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say this includes white staff disinfecting telephones after black people have used them. The allegations have driven another wedge in the already deep division along colour lines among staff at the police crime reaction unit in Pinelands.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week two coloured telephone operators alerted senior officers to the practice of white operators using disinfectant to wash the telephone receivers after black staff went off duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was the latest in a host of alleged acts of racism, said Greg Goss, second in charge at the unit and Western Cape vice-chairman of the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (Popcru).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year he shuffled staff in the unit to make it more racially representative. But he had been stifled in his attempts by a moratorium placed on the process last month by Fanie Bouwer, provincial head of crime prevention, after Director Bouwer had complaints from white staff, Superintendent Goss said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Superintendent Goss and Popcru shop steward Johannes Campher alleged that whites at the unit had put up strong resistance to the hiring of black and coloured staff, with the result that most blacks and coloureds were hoping for transfers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sergeant Campher said: &quot;We are bitter. It is clear that the white staff don't want blacks here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nine new Xhosa-speaking volunteers in the radio control centre had been subjected to verbal abuse by their white superiors, Superintendent Goss alleged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unit management is to meet provincial police commissioner Leon Wessels and his deputy Adam Blaauw next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The volunteers were appointed after the Cape Argus disclosed that there were no Xhosa-speaking people to take emergency calls. An estimated 35 to 40 percent of callers from areas such as Khayelitsha are unable to speak English or Afrikaans.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Western Cape Health Minister Ebrahim Rasool today slammed the &quot;unprofessional attitude&quot; of staff at day hospitals after Thobeka Madayi died in a wheelbarrow in Khayelitsha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cape Argus exposed the shame of her death last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Rasool said &quot;a good dose of discipline and commitment&quot; was needed from staff at primary health care institutions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action would be taken to prevent day hospitals becoming virtual ghost facilities after 1pm. &quot;By that time, in many instances, the last patients have been seen for the day. As early as 11am the gates have been closed and many patients sent home without care, simply because some staff members believe they've dealt with their 'quota' for the day.  This must end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Rasool has appointed a task group to investigate the circumstances surrounding Mrs Madayi's death in a wheelbarrow after her husband Vuyani Magazi was refused help at a Khayelitsha day hospital last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said budget difficulties could not be an excuse for everything that went wrong at a health facility. Spending on primary health care centres had in fact increased over the past three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The budget is not the reason for an ambulance not being called. It is not a reason for turning away a terminally ill patient.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Rasool said it was with &quot;regret and embarrassment&quot; that he had learned the circumstances of Mrs Madayi's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will forever be a blot on the record of health care in this province. Without reservation I wish to record my profound apology to the family and friends of Thobeka Madayi. If there is an opportunity to be identified ... it must be that the outrage is turned into a resolve to make the health system a decent, caring one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inquiry, headed by provincial Deputy Speaker Mampe Ramotsamai, would report within a week, &quot;so that we can learn from this tragedy and ensure that a sense of discipline and commitment again becomes part of the health services.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Mpumalanga's head of the safety &amp; security department, advocate Stanley Soko, admitted to the Moldenhauer Commission on Tuesday that he had been warned repeatedly over the past year that the province's traffic director was corrupt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soko said, however, that he had dismissed the charges because the junior official who made them, principal traffic inspector John Muller, was &quot;problematic&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muller eventually turned to the press after discovering that irregular learners and drivers licenses had been secretly issued to the parliamentary deputy speaker, Baleka Mbete-Kgositsile, on October 1 last year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traffic director Henry Brazer personally issued the licenses after interrupting his sick leave to drive 350km from Nelspruit to Delmas to test Mbete-Kgositsile, after a minor heart attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazer, who is not registered as a certified license test officer, used incorrect application forms, filled in incorrect information on the forms and allegedly only tested Mbete-Kgositsile on parts of the required driver's license test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No official records were kept of either the licenses or the tests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Muller made allegations of general corruption three times last year, starting in February and also called for a Commission of Inquiry into Brazer's activities after alleging that Brazer had used State funds to send four relatives on a holiday to the USA,&quot; explained Soko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, I was discouraged by Muller's actions and attitude after he refused to work under Brazer or anyone else whom he called corrupt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other allegations against Brazer by Muller include charges that he promoted officers who had been suspended for license fraud or corruption, that he had irregularly bought a boat and diving equipment with State money for personal use and that he only has a Standard Eight certificate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All these charges are now being investigated by the Moldenhauer Commission and have been repeated by a string of frustrated traffic officers who say that uncontrolled corruption has resulted in hundreds of thousands of fraudulent licenses being issued to drivers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had heard all the rumours but no-one made an official written complaint and the lack of discipline and refusal to co-operate by my own directors made it very difficult to investigate anything,&quot; said Soko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Admitting that he should have investigated Brazer never-the-less, Soko said that Brazer had simply ignored his requests to submit reports on some of the charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazer could not testify as scheduled before the Commission last week after booking himself into a private hospital under a pseudonym with a stress related heart ailment.  He issued strict instructions with the hospital not to release information about his condition or doctor's name and was secretly released on Sunday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Commission found out on Tuesday that he had been released but had not informed the Commission, Brazer's attorney, Tom Dreyer, said that Brazer had taken a powerful sleeping pill and could not speak to the Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpumalanga safety &amp; security MEC, Steve Mabona, will testify before the Commission on Wednesday after also being booked off work due to an unspecified stress related ailment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabona initially organised the two licenses for Mbete-Kgositsile and send his State-issue car and personal bodyguards to ferry her from Johannesburg to Delmas, where she was tested.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Most of the unruly junior traffic officers who are allegedly involved in widescale license fraud in Mpumalanga are family members or other relatives of the department's directors, the Moldenhauer Commission heard on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission, which is investigating the irregular issue of hundreds of thousands of fraudulent or irregular licenses including one to the deputy speaker of Parliament, Baleka Mbete-Kgositsile, heard in Nelspruit that it was impossible to discipline these corrupt officials without interference from the directors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The moment you point out that they have broken regulations or you attempt to discipline them, they simply pick up the phone and call their relatives who have no problem about transferring you,&quot; explained chief traffic inspector Hermanus Meyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the most recent incident, when I confronted officers at Kwaggafontein about cooking the books on May 2, they said that my rank meant nothing and started threatening me with death. It got so bad that license applicants forced their way into the office and joined the riot.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meyer testified that he had been forced to flee the centre to avoid being assaulted. At least three officials at Kwaggafontein are directly related to department head, advocate Stanley Soko and department director general, Cello Mahlangu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No disciplinary action was taken against the officers for the incident.  Meyer also told the Commission that none of the seven testing officers at Kwaggafontein were actually registered as certified testing officials and that the centre itself was also unregistered.  &quot;So, legally speaking, these people are breaking the law with the full knowledge of all their superiors. Every license issued from this place is therefore invalid, despite being issued on legal forms and certificates,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other problems which he had repeatedly attempted to get his superiors to investigate, he said, included regular overclaims by traffic officers on their transport and accommodation allowances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officers also insisted, Meyer said, on closing their offices at 12h00 on Fridays while collecting a salary for a full day's work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More worrying, he said, was proof that officers had sold the centre's learners license book to local Driving Schools, who then taught their pupils to learn the answers off by heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, instead of learning the rules of the road, these people learn that the answer to question one is 'A' and so on. Nine out of ten applicants pass in this way,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To prove that there had been a leakage, Meyer said that he had changed the sequence of the questions on one occasion. Every single applicant who wrote the test failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Licenses are being given to people who cannot even handle the steering wheels of cars, never mind drive. This is the reason for the high death rate on our roads and the people who are condoning it are murderers,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meyer also confirmed earlier testimony that the all vehicle test centres in KwaNdebele were &quot;pathetically inadequate&quot; and that most were simply bare pieces of bulldozed veld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I have attempted to apply normal test standards, I was been reprimanded by my superior who told me to have some sympathy and be more understanding,&quot; Meyer added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Control officers, who are meant to monitor for problems were also never in office more than two days a week he said and had on occasions used work time, vehicles and funds to go watch cricket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meyer called for the establishment of an internal but semi- independent inspectorate which could &quot;swoop&quot; on centres and check every file, document and procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only way we are going to stop this corruption is by creating a policeman for policemen. Some team of dedicated investigators with real power who can root out corruption and then monitor to ensure that it never comes back,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - The lack of proper career guidance at schools has led to matriculants with the correct qualifications drifting around aimlessly, said deputy mayor of Nelspruit, Fatima Mabuza, on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the launch of a week-long provincial careers exhibition hosted by the Career Exhibition and Information Association in Nelspruit, Mabuza said wrong career choices cost millions of rands.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Someone who is in the wrong profession will also regret it for the rest of their lives,&quot; she said.  The exhibition, which has been held for the past three years, attracted 33 exhibitors this year, compared to 21 exhibitors last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-six schools from the across the province have been invited to attend the exhibition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representative of the Association of Chatered Certified Accountants, Ndivhuho Nepfumbada, said pupils in Standards Six and Seven should should especially attend the exhibition as they still had to select subjects for their career choice.  Design School Southern Africa's Tanya Bernnitt said that since the government began focusing on technical and science subjects, art was no longer a subject at some schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some youths have the capability of being artists, but are denied that privilege because arts is no longer considered as a subject,&quot; Bernnitt said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other exhibitors at this year's exhibition include the Lowveld Agricultural College, the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, Rand Afrikaans Universiteit, the Medical University of Southern Africa, Technikon Pretoria, and other technikons and univerities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exhibition will continue until Fridaym May 16.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - The management of the Nelspruit Post Office were outwitted by a robber posing as a security guard who &quot;collected&quot; over R20 000 cash and R66 000 in cheques on Monday, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police spokesperson, Captain Joseph Fundama, told African Eye News Service (South Africa) on Tuesday that an unknown man wearing a Coin Security guard uniform arrived at the post office at midday and claimed that he was on his daily &quot;collection duty&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fundama said the management staff readily handed the suspect the money and the receipt expecting him to take it to the bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The management was surprised when the real Coin Security personnel arrived later to collect the money,&quot; said Captain Fundama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said post office staff were unable to describe the suspect because they did not suspect any foul play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No arrests have been made and police are still investigating.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Not even an extended campaign of police road blocks and spot license checks will be able to substantially reduce the number of fraudulent licenses currently being used on South Africa's roads, the Moldenhauer Commission into License Fraud heard in Nelspruit on Monday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides the man-power necessary for such an extended campaign, witnesses said that majority of traffic officers and policemen didn't have the slightest idea how to identify either fraudulent or fake licenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, police and the Commissioner of Oaths regularly stamp fraudulent licenses as being the genuine item when they don't even look remotely like proper licenses,&quot; said chief traffic inspector Jacobus Breytenbach.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During my checks on licenses at Home Affairs, I discovered that less than one percent of all licenses from KwaNdebele are valid or legal. The rest of all fraudulent or fakes in one way or another.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only way to &quot;weed out&quot; the hundreds of thousands of suspected fraudulent licenses was to appoint a special task team to physically check each one of the estimated 5-million licenses currently listed on the Home Affairs population register computer system, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This team would have to receive special training to check for incorrect date stamps, signatures, serial numbers, technical information and colour inconsistencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A simultaneous switch to a system where all drivers have to be re- tested for their licenses every five to seven years would also help phase out any additional fraudulent licenses which were missed by the task team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But even then, we cannot constitutionally scrap suspected fraudulent licenses without really strong evidence or we'd open ourselves to civic law suits,&quot; Breytenbach said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, Breytenbach said, not even those licenses which were issued without bribery or fraud are all valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serious inadequacies at virtually all test centres in KwaNdebele and KaNgwane prevented license applicants from being tested properly, he explained.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Mpumlanga's provincial government is still conducting a feasibility study into the construction of the province's first international airport at Primkop, near Nelspruit, more than two years after the initiative was first launched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit is one of only seven towns which will be accorded full international airport rights under a new government initiative to tighten up customs control.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpumalanga MEC for public works, roads and transport, Lackson Mathebula, said on Monday that the feasibility study was being done to determine whether there was enough of a demand for an international airport in Nelspruit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presenting his budget speech for 1997/98, Mathebula said the study would also determine the size of the airport and whether the selected site was technically suitable and safe before development began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thereafter, he said, the project would be handed over to the private sector to build, operate and transfer to his department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mathebula said his department had already invited and received proposals for the construction, operation and transfer of the airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He explained that his department was relying largely on private sector funding to develop the airport, but that his department had already budgeted to buy the land on which it would be built.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is important that government owns the land,&quot; Mathebula explained.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - The Namibian Police Drug Enforcement Unit achieved a major breakthrough in the fight against international drug smuggling when they arrested four people for possession of cocaine with a street value of N$3,2 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nampol confiscated a cache of 6,412 kilograms of cocaine, the biggest haul in Namibia's history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four males, all travelling on Zambian passports, was arrested over a period of three weeks through an undercover operation spanning Windhoek and Keetmanshoop.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bust came as a result of a tip-off from a member of the public and close co-operation from Interpol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first operation on April 30, Michael Bwalya (25) and Moses Mwiya (31) were arrested at Windhoek hospitality centre with 1,37 kg of cocaine. Bwalya's passport identified him as a student while Mwiya's described as a businessman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both were staying in Hillbrow, South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the second operation on May 4, Fred Obed Malimba (25) from Sandton City was arrested at the Windhoek Bus Terminal following a tip-off by a vigilant member of the public. Malimba was arrested in possession of cocaine with a street value of N$2,3 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final operation took place on May 10 when Romanus Mutale (37) was arrested at a travellers lodge at Keetmanshoop with 1,4kg cocaine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All four have already appeared in court and their cases were postponed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police spokesperson Inspector Hieronymous Goraseb told a media briefing yesterday that drug syndicates had discovered a new method of operation, mailing drugs to their destinations through normal postal services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only in the operation at the bus terminal was the suspect in possession of the cocaine. In the other cases the drug had been mailed and the suspects were caught red-handed after collecting it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goraseb said parcels were sent from a South American country to Namibians who collected them for the suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Chief Inspector Louis Mensah, drug smugglers arrive in the country and seek accommodation for a couple of days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having obtained the address and telephone number of their Namibian host, after leaving the smuggler would telephone the host asking him to collect a parcel at the post office which had been sent to the host's address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The smuggler would then collect the packet at a later stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mensah said the latest method of drug smuggling was very worrying as Namibians were allowing themselves to be used in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goraseb added that the Police could not ignore a Namibian's role in such a case and warned citizens to be on the alert for such operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Police had worked 24 hours a day for three weeks on the case and are confident that they are on the brink of a major breakthrough against a drug smuggling syndicate using the suspects as &quot;couriers&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, a 45-year-old woman was arrested with cocaine with a street value of N$1,4 million. She was nabbed while waiting for someone to pick her up at Windhoek International Airport following close co-operation with German customs officials.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - Government has denied recent accusations by the Journalists Association of Namibia regarding calls made by high-ranking officials about imposing restrictions on freedom of expression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of Information and Broadcasting, Ben Amathila, said in a statement the accusations were viewed as serious and there was no intention to interfere in the freedoms enshrined in the Namibian Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Government recently demonstrated its commitment to freedom of the media by amending the Privileges and Immunities of Parliament Bill after it was brought to its attention that certain clauses in the Bill impeded media freedom,&quot; Amathila said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a function to mark World Press Freedom Day in Windhoek last Friday, JAN said it was concerned &quot;about an increasingly intolerant attitude on the part of members of the Government towards the fundamental right to freedom of expression through the media&quot; as enshrined in the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JAN also dismissed recent assaults on the integrity of media practitioners as attempts aimed at undermining the credibility of the media in the eyes of the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previously JAN had come out strongly against a statement by President Sam Nujoma in an interview with a local bi-weekly in which he described the media as unpatriotic and the &quot;enemy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a Namibian press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is foreigners who are leading the press here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are South African or have their own foreign tradition and culture ...&quot; Nujoma said in the December interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a workshop in March, Nguno Wakolele, permanent secretary of the Ministry of Information threatened that the Constitution would be changed if the media failed to act responsibly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all cherish this freedom (of expression) and we have to guard it like a fragile and perishable commodity,&quot; Wakolele said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, Amathila said every right entailed its own responsibility and therefore Government called on the media to be accountable in their reporting and to be sensitive to the views of all citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The past is still fresh in the memories of many Namibians and the media are in a position to stir up emotions which could place our peace and unity in jeopardy,&quot; he noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Press Freedom Day, JAN also acknowledged Government's achievements and efforts so far in maintaining democracy and freedom of expression.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Economic structural adjustment programmes, often at the urging of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, have been blamed for triggering survival mechanisms in the developing world's natural resources sector, thereby threatening the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a joint presentation at the 15th Commonwealth Forestry Conference, two experts said reforms had resulted in a proliferation of timber logging enterprises, cottage industries, illegal game hunting and illegal conversion of forest reserves to agricultural land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lidia Brito of Mozambique's Eduardo Mondlane University and Patrick Mushove of the Zimbabwe Forest Research Centre said Mozambique introduced the reforms after a vicious 16-year-old civil war which spurred massive migration.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In that process, national parks were converted to military bases, marginalizing the wildlife, the commercial hardwood was exploited without any control, thus facilitating the proliferation of small-scale and often illegal logging,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Zimbabwe, the national parks and safaris sub-sector was able to maintain adequate stocks for hunting and non-consumptive tourism, besides restraining human encroachment onto the parks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the two said success was still far as illegal settlements on protected forests continued to haunt authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They called for a general rehabilitation policy for Mozambique which would see the indigenous hardwood and tourist industries streamlined, decentralized and located within forest and wildlife producing districts to ensure maximum benefits for local communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Among other things, the current timber permit system should be replaced by a concession regime that ensures concessionaire accountability for at least 10 years from the date it was granted,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Zimbabwe, the two argued in favour of the consolidation of institutional arrangements conducive to the sustainable functioning of the Campfire concept in wildlife areas and to the promotion of the same concept in timber and non-wood products obtainable from state farms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They noted that wood carving was an important ancillary industry in both countries and was attached to the tourist industry. Therefore, they proposed that it be tolerated, formalized, supported and incorporated into local institutions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (PANA) - Libyan leader Moammar Kadhafi's flight to Niger and Nigeria last week, despite a United Nations air embargo on his country, is to be investigated by the Sanctions Committee of the United Nations Security Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking Tuesday after a closed-door session of the council in New York, council President Park Soo Gil said its members had decided to refer the issue to the committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the committee, expected to discuss the issue Thursday or Friday, would &quot;listen to explanations that will be given by the three countries concerned with a view to establishing the fact.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kadhafi flew to Niger and Nigeria in four Libyan aircraft to hold prayers marking the Muslim new year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the flight violated the U.N. air embargo imposed on Libya over its alleged involvement in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. It was also under the embargo for the bombing of a French UTA airliner over Niger a year later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Bill Richardson, has expressed his country's concern over the flight violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I raised the Libyan issue,&quot; he told U.N. correspondents after briefing the council Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is obvious that Mr. Kadhafi is in a joy ride, trying to defy the council and our hope is that the council and the Sanctions Committee would deal with this issue very soon,&quot; he added. In Washington, the U.S.  State Department called for punitive action against Niger and Nigeria for their &quot;complicity&quot; in the violation of the sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns said that the U.S. had evidence that the trip was planned and worked out secretly by the governments of Niger, Nigeria and Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described the trip as a &quot;conscious provocation, not only on the part of Libya but also of Niger and Nigeria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kadhafi's trip was the latest in a series of Libya's violation of the sanctions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - The impact and effect of AIDS is expected to cause a drastic reduction of tens of millions in the projected population figures of South Africa during the first quarter of the next century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the dramatic finding of international experts in the latest edition of the World Population Data Sheet, published annually by the Washington-based Population Reference Bureau.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1997 edition predicts that the population of South Africa in the year 2010 will be 45.7 million -- almost 12 million below the 1996 forecast of 57.5 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It further predicts that in the following 15 years to 2025 there will be a slight reduction in South Africa's population from 45.7 million to 45.5 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should these predictions prove correct, it means that South Africa's population in 28 years from now will be almost the same as it is today.  And the bureau points out that these predictions could be further affected by unpredictable factors such as famines, plagues and other natural disasters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report -- for which AIDS data has been gathered for over a decade -- goes on to point out that other countries in sub-Saharan Africa are facing the same situation as South Africa, among them Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The dramatic projection is based on work done by the United States Bureau of Census, and it is simply due to AIDS,&quot; the report adds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - A critical agenda to review the past and chart the course for Africa's future politics and economics has been prepared for the 33rd Organisation of African Unity (OAU) summit to be held in Harare next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a news conference on Wednesday, Zimbabwe's foreign affairs minister, Stan Mudenge, said the three-day assembly of African heads of state and government starting on June 2, would discuss a wide range of issues covering politics, economics and health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pan-Africanism has triumphed, we have triumphed on the political front and now we are on the economic war front,&quot; Mudenge said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 53-member body, whose chairmanship goes to President Robert Mugabe for the next 12 months, has been praised for its role in ending colonial rule in most of the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in the limelight during the summit would be Ghana, which celebrates 40 years of independence and was the first state, south of the Sahara, to achieve that status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The celebration, however, takes place at a time when there are a number of countries still torn by conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All this takes place against political developments of the Great Lakes, which will preoccupy the heads and we will look at Liberia, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Burundi, the peace process in Angola, the Middle East and the disagreement between Libya, France, Britain and America,&quot; Mudenge said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit will look at the Lome Convention in light of the green paper that has been prepared by the European Union on the state of relations and trade with its 71 partners of the African, Caribbean and Pacific states (ACP) after the year 2000 when the convention expires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fight against malaria is also on the agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The World Health Organisation (WHO) is proposing the adoption of a declaration to fight Malaria,&quot; the minister said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malaria has re-emerged as a fatal diseases as a strain resistant to most first line drugs is being experienced by many countries, including Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We look forward to a busy time,&quot; Mudenge said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, two candidates have forwarded their names for consideration for the post of Organisation of African Unity (OAU) Secretary-General when it falls vacant at the 33rd summit of African heads of state and government in Harare in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incumbent, Salim Ahmed Salim of Tanzania who is seeking a third term, is being challenged the foreign minister of Cote d'Ivoire, Amara Essy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim, who has been at the helm of the 53-member organisation since 1989, is a former deputy prime minister of Tanzania.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, the only female candidate contesting Liberia's forthcoming presidential election, said here Wednesday, she would use her national and international contacts to accelerate economic reconstruction post-war country Liberia if elected president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The great task in Liberia is that of economic reconstruction, to counter the deterioration of the past 10 to 15 years,&quot; she said at the monthly forum organised by the Pan-african News Agency (PANA) and the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson-Sirleaf, a former Liberian finance minister and until recently UNDP's assistant administrator and director of the regional bureau for Africa, said Liberia was in need of &quot;a leader not a ruler.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Liberians are tired of war and will no longer support those who exploited and appropriated the resources of the country,&quot; she said, adding that the issue was not about money, but about &quot;rebuilding, healing and national unity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the task of mobilizing war-traumatised Liberians for national reconstruction required someone with a &quot;good tract record and the sensitivity of a woman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson-Sirleaf, 58, who holds a master's degree in public administration from Harvard, is on the board of several African and international development institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was a pioneer member of the group of the World Bank's council of African advisers, and a recipient of the Grand Commander Star of African Redemption, Liberia's highest civilian award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A founding member of Liberia's Action Party that challenged the military regime of late president Samuel Doe in the 1985 elections, Johnson-Sirleaf, recalled her political activism, which landed her in jail twice for a total of nine months between July 1985 and July 1986.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have been through it before and I feel myself equal to the task of leadership,&quot; she said, adding &quot;as a political figure, private citizen and mother, I have been at the forefront of social, economic and political development in Africa and throughout the world for more than two decades.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 16 parties have sprung up in Liberia for the post-war elections earlier scheduled for May 30 under a peace accord singed by the warring factions in Liberia in Abuja.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this date now appears unrealistic, with many of the parties calling for a postponement to allow for better preparation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PANA learnt that a meeting of all Liberian political parties has been called for Thursday in Abuja, with Nigerian head of state and the ECOWAS chairman Gen. Sani Abacha, expected to agree on a new date for the elections after a civil war that has killed more than 150,000 people in Africa's first republic founded in 1847 by freed slaves from America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson-Sirleaf said her Unity Party was ready for the poll, provided it was held after adequate preparation and under conducive atmosphere to make the result &quot;acceptable and credible.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI, Kenya (PANA) - Kenya's national football team, Harambee Stars, left Nairobi Tuesday night for a three-week training stint in Germany in preparation for their return leg Group I World Cup qualifier against Nigeria's Super Eagles in lagos on June 7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Germany, the team will be based in a small resort town of Gundelfigen where they are expected to play a series of friendly matches against the local sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team will also have the opportunity to watch the European Champions' League final on May 28 between Germany's Borussia Dortmund and Juventus of Turin, Italy, at the Munich Olympic Stadium.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harambee Stars are to travel straight from Germany to Lagos to take on the Super Eagles who hope to bag the three points on offer in the forthcoming encounter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's unfortunate that we drew in Nairobi (against Harambee Stars) but we are confident that we will get the points in Lagos and play a good game against Guinea,&quot; Nigeria's Turkey-based Dan Amokachi, was quoted as saying after the 2-1 victory his team obtained against Burkina Faso in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria, which is on top of Group I, plays its final qualifier against Guinea in Conakry while Kenya, which is second, plays its last game in Burkina Faso in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harambee Stars German born coach, Reinhardt Fabisch, who is back to Kenya after a nine-year absence, is confident that his boys are capable of upsetting the Super Eagles and sneaking into the World Cup finals slated for France in 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we can beat Nigeria then the first thing I will do when I get home is to enroll at the Alliance Francaise for French classes&quot; to prepare for France 98, Fabisch said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Kenya Football Federation (KFF) in conjunction with Minto Travels Company and Ethiopian Airlines have offered an attractive package for Harambee stars' fans wishing to travel to Lagos for the return match against the Super Eagles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The package announced by the football administration body last week follows the increasing interest by Kenyan fans to travel to Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The travel group announced that fans will be required to pay us 770 U.S dollars (about 41,580 K. Shs) to cover air ticket and full board accommodation for one day, air transfers, visas, security and VIP tickets for the game which will be played at the National Stadium in Sulere.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">YAOUNDE, Cameroon (PANA) - Forty-four Cameroonian political parties are now flexing muscles for the upcoming legislative elections in which 180 seats are up for grabs on May 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out of the country's 150 political parties, only 44 have been registered by the Ministry of Territorial Administration which is organizing the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A source in the ministry told CAMNEWS that out of these registered parties, only 13 are represented in all the 74 the constituencies. These include the major parties -- the CPDM (Cameroon's People's Democratic Party), SDF (Social Democratic Front), UNDP (National Union For Democracy and Progress) and the CDU (Union for Democracy and Progress).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaigns have gone into full swing as each party tries to convince voters. The government has allocated air time on radio and television to each party and foreign observers from France, the United States and the Commonwealth are already in the country to monitor the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from incumbent President Paul Biya who is running on the ticket of the ruling CPDM, the other party leaders have embarked on hectic campaigns countrywide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As expected, most of them are already crying foul over the absence of an independent electoral commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They do not trust the &quot;neutrality&quot; of the Ministry of Territorial Administration, which they consider as an arm of the ruling CPDM government since the bosses in this Ministry belong to the ruling party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, the campaigns have so far been devoid of violence. The Government has also promised to maintain peace during and after the elections. However, a curfew is still being maintained in the North-West Province where violent confrontation between the army and armed gangs left many people dead last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only four political parties were represented in the defunct parliament. The CPDM had 88 seats as against 68 seats for UNDP, 18 seats for UPC and six seats for the MDR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in last year's local council elections, few analysts expect miracles in the political landscape after May 17. But many say the fact that the radical opposition led the SDF, which boycotted previous polls will now participate, could upset the status quo ante.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Cameroon's democratic wind of change started blowing in 1990, the SDF has left a hallmark in the country's political history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Launched on May 26, 1990 in Bamenda, the SDF, with its charismatic Chairman John Fru Ndi, stands out as a political force to be reckoned with. The Party boycotted the 1992 legislative elections, thus giving the leeway for other parties to grab parliamentary seats in its strongholds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in the 1992 Presidential elections, the SDF candidate came second to the CPDM's Paul Biya. Now, the SDF has said bygone to boycotts and is taking part in all elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, the Party's national following was felt during last year's Council elections when it grabbed seats outside its strongholds in major parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SDF swept council seats in almost all corners of the republic, &quot;even in Yaounde, the CPDM stronghold,&quot; says Tatah Mentan an eminent political scientist and lecturer at the Advanced School of Mass Communications in Yaounde.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it remains to be seen whether the SDF is capable of unseating the ruling CPDM party which was created in 1985, also in Bamenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CPDM is one of the parties that is represented in all the legislative constituencies in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although some of its big wigs failed in the current primaries, its Assistant Secretary-General, Gregoire Owona, says the party is set to maintain if not surpass its numerical strength in parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then comes the UNDP which has headquarters in the northern town of Garoua, hometown of former President Amadou Ahidjo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's leader, Bello Bouba Maigari was once a Prime Minister. He is considered to be a tactful politician who measures his words with icy precision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1992 legislative elections saw his party reaping dividends in the South, West and North-West provinces when the SDF boycotted the polls.  It had the second largest number of MP's in the defunct parliament after the CPDM, and commands most of the councils in its stronghold is in the northern provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the UNDP has lately been rocked by resignations and carpet- crossing by some influential militants, especially Adamou Nganda an MP from Mbere and that of Mvouen Vincent Mohamadou (alternate MP from Bankim, to the CPDM Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both accuse Maigari of being allergic to the aspirations of grassroots militants. Whatever the case, the May 17 legislative election results will show whether their resignations will have any effect on the party in their various constituencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UPC -- the oldest political party in the country -- could have been a force to be reckoned with had internal strife not torn it into two bickering factions: the UPC Kodock and the UPC Ntumazah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, the party is just a mere shadow of itself with the leaders of the various factions operating in their fiefs in the manner of ancient warlords.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* suffered the wrenching disruption of forced removals in respect of their homes, businesses and land;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* over the years suffered the shame of being arrested for pass law offences;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* over the decades, and indeed centuries, suffered the indignities and humiliation of racial discrimination;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* for a long time were prevented from exercising their full democratic rights in the land of their birth;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* were unable to achieve their full potential because of job reservation; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* in any way suffered as a result of discriminatory legislation and policies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr De Klerk said he had apologised on at least three previous occasions, but offered this renewed apology &quot;in a spirit of true repentance in full knowledge of the tremendous harm that apartheid has done to millions of South Africans&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr De Klerk's remarks came during the National Party's second submission to the Truth Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said there was a perception that the NP was not accepting overall responsibility for its part in the conflict of the past, that NP politicians were leaving the security forces in the lurch and that they were &quot;washing their hands&quot; of things done in terms of their policies and decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once again this is simply not true. Let me state clearly that the National Party and I accept full responsibility for all our policies, decisions and actions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NP stood by its security forces, who had implemented its policies and decisions &quot;and all reasonable interpretations thereof&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there were many things which had not been authorised by the NP and of which they were not aware, Mr De Klerk said. &quot;The recent information of atrocities I find as shocking and abhorrent as anyone else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr De Klerk said he could not accept that every statement made in amnesty applications was the truth, and that he was not in a position to pass judgment on these cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Murders and assassinations cannot be justified. Anyone who did go as far as that did something totally unacceptable, and we stand by that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Pagad has called for the resignation of Olympic Bid Company staff and the provincial director of labour, Brian Williams, over the signing of an anti-crime initiative with alleged gangsters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement, signed with the Community Outreach Forum (Core) - the organisation of gangsters who say they have reformed - did not include an undertaking to stop dealing in drugs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initiative involves using gangs to help fight crime in Cape Town to boost the city's 2004 Olympic bid. In the programme's manifesto, the gangsters declared their willingness to act as &quot;protectors of communities&quot;, rid the city centre and Bo-Kaap of criminal activity and clear street youth gangs from the area by today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People Against Gangsterism and Drugs national secretary Shariff Khan said his organisation was not anti-Olympic and acknowledged the Games to be a noble institution with noble efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we are against a corrupt Olympics where known drug dealers and gangsters form part of the bidding process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation was now that the Bid Company, the Government and big business had formed an alliance with gangsters at the expense of law-abiding citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is now in the hands of drug dealers and gangsters to determine the destiny of a sane and sober society. As Pagad we say 'No' to this alliance and call for the resignation of all Olympic bid officials and of Mr Williams, who initiated the plan. If this situation is not rectified immediately, Pagad will call for a boycott of the Olympic bid and big businesses supporting the bid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bid Company intends issuing a statement soon. It is understood the company hopes to hold discussions with Pagad.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The actions this weekend of Roelf Meyer and National Party leader F W de Klerk will be monitored closely by a large group of black Nat MPs, who will meet next week to discuss whether they are satisfied with the outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the group are from the Western Cape and include those pushing for an enhanced leadership role for people of colour in the NP in the province, including a demand for a coloured premier. Sources denied that the discussions should be seen as a move towards the establishment of a formal black caucus within the NP.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, there was concern that disclosures about next week's talks would result in a backlash by the conservative white bloc within the party, which has been seen as the victor in the decision by Mr De Klerk to shut down Mr Meyer's taskforce investigating a political realignment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The developments are part of continuing racial tensions within the party, particularly in the Western Cape, where there is pressure for the NP to reward people of colour who delivered it control of provincial and much of local government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, signs are that efforts are being made to defuse tensions within the party prior to the weekend meeting of the Gauteng head council, which Mr De Klerk and Mr Meyer are to address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Party sources said it appeared Mr De Klerk was succeeding in keeping most of the NP behind him through the crisis. And efforts were also made at this week's special meeting of the Gauteng executive to keep Mr Meyer on board within the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interviewed after the Gauteng executive meeting, Mr Meyer said he had had a &quot;very good discussion&quot; with the executive.  However, he had not yet made a decision on whether it would be best to stay in the party, leave it, or leave politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence of the continuing divergence between Meyer loyalists in Gauteng and the rest of the party was a statement issued by the provincial NP youth in which they reiterated leader Paolo Andrade's view that the NP should disband to facilitate further developments towards a political realignment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The African National Congress has submitted the names of people who spied on it to the truth and reconciliation commission, but has asked that the list be kept secret.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African National Congress has placed the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in an awkward dilemma by asking it to keep secret the identities of ANC members who spied for the former government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation's argument that the agents could face the danger of assassination or harassment if their names were disclosed is hardly a persuasive reason for subverting a fundamental function of the TRC - the fullest possible disclosure of human rights abuses that took place during the apartheid era.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security police and others who have confessed to horrendous crimes and have asked for amnesty have been publicly identified and they stand as much risk of assassination or other harassment in the future as would ANC members who spied on the organisation for the former government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC cannot ask for its confidential evidence to the TRC to be treated differently. Neither should argument over its request for secrecy be allowed to obscure an equally grave matter which the organisation appears to be unwilling to present to the TRC - the methods and processes by which it identified the agents and spies in its ranks, and the procedures by which some of them were punished and even executed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is common cause that some prisoners in ANC camps were appallingly treated. It has been admitted that some were found guilty and sentenced to death by tribunals on which nobody had any legal qualification or experience. What has still to be disclosed is the evidence which condemned these people to death or punishment and how it was obtained. That is essential to any informed assessment of the ANC's activities during the struggle and its violations of human rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - An escape from death on board a cargo ship more than a quarter of a century ago prompted Sedick Christian, one of District Six's most colourful characters, to devote time for the rest of his life to helping poor people and those in distress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sedick, among other things, is currently struggling to provide decent burials for city vagrants and save them from the indignity of a pauper's funeral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His work as a Good Samaritan began on the day he saved the life of a shipmate, and was badly injured himself, on board the cargo vessel SA Komatiland in Las Palmas in 1971.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vessel had called at the island for maintenance repairs and a general paint spruce-up. Sedick, a professional seaman who had clawed his way up from galley boy to Bosun, had just finished a stint of duty when a deckhand, painting a mast, fell out from a bosun's chair.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He had not secured his harness properly,&quot; said Sedick,&quot;and he would surely have been killed had I not gone directly beneath him to cushion his fall with my shoulders and back tilted at a 40 degree angle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the seaman escaped with a broken arm, I was more seriously injured. I spent six weeks in hospital in Las Palmas with a back injury - but I had the satisfaction of knowing I had saved someone's life. The incident prompted me, from then on, to do something good for my fellow men and women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past year Sedick has shouldered the responsibiltiy of organising the burials of three city vagrants after raising the money for their funerals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now 54 years old, he is caretaker of the area's Indian Plaza and a committee member of the District Six Night Shelter in Selkirk Street. He says he will only undertake charitable work on request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has found it is not always easy for a Good Samaritan to raise money for his work and, on at least one occasion, he has had to pay out of his own pocket to make up the deficit in covering the cost of a funeral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That was when Jennifer Jantjies, a vagrant in her 30s, was knocked down and killed by a taxi. The other vagrants in the area asked me to give her a decent burial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I approached various people, including a number of businesmen, for financial aid but could not raise the full amount - and I made up the deficit from my own pocket. Soon afterwards another vagrant, Anna Jones, who was 29, died from a disease and then Phillip Johnson, 49, collapsed and died after asking me to give him a birthday treat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last Christmas I kept my promise to Phillip and gave his bergie friends a belated treat from the money which I had raised. I asked my wife, Amiena, to cook some food and I distributed it among the vagrants, telling them this was what Phillip had asked me to do before he died.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking of his days as a mariner, he says the urge to go to sea was irresistible from the time he reached puberty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes he could be a descendant of his namesake, Fletcher Christian of Mutiny on the Bounty fame, who was said to have fathered offspring among the South Pacific islanders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Fletcher, he too was involved in a mutiny - but fortunately history was not repeated because it was on a different issue and on a much smaller scale. The dispute was amicably resolved through a bit of hard bargaining and negotiation with the officers and captain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After that, the German captain of the vessel was very wary of me and repeatedly wanted to know how Fletcher was related to me,&quot; he said with a laugh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to his seaman's papers, Sedick sailed in 15 ships in a 13-year career at sea which took him all over the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After giving up his career at sea, he took his first &quot;landlubber&quot; job as a stevedore supervisor and then became a forklift- and heavy duty crane-operator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An interest in civic issues prompted him to stand as an independent candidate in the municipal elections last year.  He did not win &quot;but it was an interesting exercise from which one could only learn&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before going to sea he appeared on stage as a harmonising vocalist with a popular District Six based singing group, the &quot;original&quot; Rockets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His interest in entertainment still continues today and he recruits stage and variety artists for charity concerts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The Saldanha Steel Project has awarded a R15- million contract to a Cape Town black consortium to paint its steel manufacturing plant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consortium of nine painting contractors known as Group 10 Civils will begin painting next week and continue until September next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saldanha steel project director Ben Nel said Group 10 Civils was awarded the contract because it had presented a professional bid.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a commitment to the Western Cape government to utilise emerging small businesses in the construction of the Saldanha project and Group 10 Civils were the perfect choice,&quot; Mr Nel told the Cape Argus during a ceremony to mark the signing of the contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said 800 000 sq m of wall needed to be painted after the plant, to be called Corex 2000, had been constructed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Nel added that to date Saldanha steel had awarded contracts with a combined value of R250 million to black and small businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Group 10 Civils spokesman Stan D'Oliviera said the company had set itself the objective of performing a world class job with regard to product and service management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other small black-owned companies would be judged on Group 10 Civils' performance, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Long after Corex 2000 has been painted and commissioned, this initiative will always be interpreted and remembered as the standard by which all other contracts will be measured.  It will occupy a proud place in the history of our country's development,&quot; Mr Nel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were awarded the contract because of a competitive bid and because we demonstrated our technical capacity to execute the job, and we showed an ability to organise our workforce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Corex 2000 plant is the second of its kind in South Africa capable of producing liquid iron by using a variety of low-grade coals as fuel. The first plant is at Iscor's Pretoria works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western Cape Economic Affairs Minister Chris Nissen, who was also at the signing ceremony, praised Saldanha Steel for awarding the contract to a small black-owned company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there is a company that is a leader of empowerment, then Saldanha Steel is certainly a leader in this field in the province. In many instances, they are even ahead of the provincial government which has a flawed tendering process,&quot; Mr Nissen said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The Truth Commission has asked the African National Congress to help find Katiza Cebekhulu, who said he was abducted by the ANC to prevent his testifying against Winnie Madikizela-Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Cebekhulu was one of the accused in the trial in which the coach of the Mandela Football Club, Jerry Richardson, was jailed for murdering 14-year-old activist Stompie Seipei.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC said new evidence had come to light suggesting its cadre who was jailed for the incident, Sipho Mabena, may have been tortured into a confession.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case was raised by Truth Commissioner Wynand Malan, who said the 114kg bomb - three times the size of the Church Street car-bomb which killed 19 and injured more than 200 - had been found in a taxi parked in the Hallmark parking garage on July 28, 1990. The garage is in the basement of a building used by the SA National Defence Force.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Deliver the basics to the Western Cape justice system if you are serious about reducing crime, Attorney-General Frank Kahn has told the Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To date, too little had been done by the new government to address deep concerns about salaries, accommodation, re-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sources, staff, appointments and policy in the system, he said in his annual report tabled in Parliament yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem of inexperienced staff and outdated tools had to be addressed in the short term. The average age of prosecutors in magistrates' courts was 22 and their average experience was only six months, he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And administrative infrastructures in the departments of police and justice lacked a national electronic database to keep track of criminals who committed crimes repeatedly. As a result, they were released on bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whereas strategic planning is essential for change, the Government should guard against ignoring the basic needs and tools of a good criminal justice system in the pursuit of a new vision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration of justice was in crisis and it was vital that salaries and resources were addressed urgently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 90-page document, Mr Kahn outlined extensive problems that needed to be dealt with urgently. They included:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A shortage of personnel in the attorney-general's office because of lack of funds for expansion - as a result, there was insufficient investigation and preparation of cases related to gangs, organised crime and commercial cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* An unbearable workload on the 24 regional courts while they dealt with the most serious crimes; by the end of 1995 there were 3 000 cases outstanding on their rolls and this rose to 3 500 a year later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A delay in filling vacant posts that had seriously affected understaffed prosecutors' and magistrates' sections, and relief staff in lower courts were insufficient to cushion the vacancies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Rationalisation in the public service adding to the demotivation of staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Prosecutors often doing their jobs under difficult and dangerous circumstances - security needed to be addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A need for more special courts dealing with rape and child victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The police child protection unit not functioning in areas where most cases originated - Khayelitsha, Guguletu, Langa and Nyanga - resulting in investigations not being done properly.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) - The Sudanese government has announced here that it has now released all political detainees and urged the country's opposition to reconsider their position towards the regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on state television Wednesday night, the country's justice minister, Abdel Basit Sabdarat, said &quot; Sudan has no more political detainees, all have been freed.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister said that as government prepares to produce a permanent constitution, it would like to involve as many politicians as possible in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those released include a former Deputy Prime Minister and interior minister, Sid-Ahmed al Hussein of the outlawed Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Abdel Mahmoud Hajj Salih, a former Attorney General and Abdel Rahman Abdalla Nugdallah, a relative of former Prime Minister Sadiq al Mahdi and Mohamed Ismail al Azahari, son of the first Sudanese post- independence president, Ismail al Azahari of the DUP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting Thursday on the release of detainees, the Sudanese Foreign Minister, Ali Osman Mohamed Taha, told the country's news agency that the number of people released contradicted western claims that the government of Gen. Omar al Bashir, was holding a big number of people as political detainees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the release of the prisoners was to mark &quot;a new political era&quot; in the Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The release of political detainees comes barely a month after the Khartoum government signed a peace agreement with minor Southern Sudanese warring groups, on April 22.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political gesture has also coincided with preparations for a conference to promote peace in southern Sudan by the Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - South Africa is being flooded with requests for asylum at a rate of more than 1,000 applications every month since September last year, according to the Department of Home Affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department said in a statement on Wednesday it has received 26,000 applications for asylum in the past three years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of these, more than 10,600 had been processed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said only six applicants had been granted full asylum, while 1,330 had been given asylum for a two-year period, renewable after re- evaluation. Just over another 2,000 people had been granted renewable six-month residence permits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of more than 800 of the applications had been dismissed as &quot;manifestly unfounded&quot;; almost 4,400 had been rejected, nearly 900 had been referred to regional offices and more than 1,000 of the requests had been withdrawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Home Affairs spokesman said that almost 15,300 applications for asylum still had to be considered. The refugees concerned were granted temporary residence in South Africa pending the outcome of their applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most applications -- more than 4,000 -- came from Argentina. Nigeria was second with nearly 3,000 applications while Zaire placed third with nearly 2,800.Next in line were Somalia, Pakistan and Senegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asylum in South Africa is granted only when a person is at risk of persecution in his own country because of religious beliefs, political unrest or war.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Organisation of African Unity (OAU) Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim faces a tough battle in his bid for a third term at the helm of the pan-African body when the organisation meets for its 33rd summit in Harare early June. INL002 from SSS.066 (970515-17:40) QN PANAINL .PANADKR MSG065G/02E PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PAN(2)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Tanzanian national, Salim is being challenged by Amara Essy, Cote d'Ivoire's foreign minister, in an election that diplomats and analysts say could split the summit along the Anglophone-Francophone fault line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe's foreign minister, Stan Mudenge, confirmed the governments of Tanzania and Cote d'Ivoire were busy canvassing for support for their candidates but there was no indication yet as to how both candidates would fare.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, diplomats in Harare predicted that French-speaking Africa, which holds a slight majority over English-speaking countries in the 53- member OAU, could vote as a bloc for the Ivorian, creating serious problems for the former Tanzanian deputy prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As of now, you can safely assume that the Anglophone-Francophone divide will come into play. France, of course, will urge its former colonies to vote for the Ivorian,&quot; said one diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the French deputy ambassador to Zimbabwe, Alice-Anne Medard, said france, despite being a strong supporter of the OAU, had no role in the selection of the organisation's chief executive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;France does not decide who should be Secretary-General because France is not an African country,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traditionally, there has been squabbling between French and English- speaking Africa when it comes to choosing the secretary-general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Paris connection is likely to be more assertive this time around, analysts say, because of the setbacks French foreign policy has suffered in Africa in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rivalry between Washington and Paris, which stretches from differences over command of the NATO European sector, has also spilled to Africa where the United States is seen as encroaching on traditional French spheres of influence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all intents and purposes, France has already lost Rwanda to the English-speaking Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that Laurent Kabila's rebels, in U.S.-style battle fatigues complete with Wellington boots, backed by Rwanda and English-speaking Uganda have virtually over-run Zaire has not helped French diplomacy in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That there is no direct role for the French government in the negotiations for transfer of power in Zaire adds to the consternation in Paris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The French minister of state for co-operation, Jacques Godfrain, writing in the daily newspaper Le Figaro, summed up France's African diplomatic set-backs when he said: &quot;Over the past few months, no conversation in fashionable society, no refined intellect, no feature article has failed to deplore the fact that Africans are turning their backs on France.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a demonstration of French interest in matters of the OAU, Medard said, the French government invited Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe to Paris in March for consultations in anticipation of his assumption of the chairmanship of the OAU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the level of secretary-general, however, there is nothing to show that Paris is overly enthusiastic about Salim, whom the French government threatened to veto in 1996 if he stood for the post of UN secretary-general because &quot;il ne parle pas francais&quot; (he does not speak french).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The French language is central to French foreign policy and it is hardly debatable that if the French government could have its way, it would want to see a French-speaker at the Addis Ababa-based continental body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts say there is also a feeling in some quarters that Salim, with two terms behind him, the last one of which he stood unopposed, has stayed long enough in the Ethiopian capital and that it is time somebody else, preferably from French-speaking Africa, took over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the 53-year-old Essy is no small candidate for the job either.  With a diplomatic career spanning some 27 years, he has served in several countries including Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, Switzerland, and the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has participated in nine OAU summits and a number of ministerial meetings as well as all the summits of the Economic Community of West African States since 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim, arguably one of Africa's finest diplomats, has reinvigorated the OAU and given it relevance at a time critics derided it as an anachronism and a toothless talk-shop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under him, an OAU mechanism for conflict prevention, resolution and management was created to give Africans a capacity to resolve their own conflicts. An early-warning mechanism on conflicts is also being set up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea has since caught on with regional peacekeeping structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters of Salim say he started a good project and needs a third four-year term to finish it. But others say &quot;ca suffit&quot; (it's enough).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA, Uganda (PANA) - Besides combating rebels in the north, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has now to worry about birds which have become a nuisance at the country's gate-way, Entebbe International Airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of birds swarming the runway recently delayed the Ugandan leader from taking off to the United Kingdom in his presidential jet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When his patience ran out, Museveni ordered members of the Presidential Protection Unit (PPU) to drive away the birds so that his plane could take off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were many kaloli (a local name for the marabou) birds on the runway which delayed the presidential jet from taking off for sometime,&quot; an official of the Uganda civil Aviation Authority (CCA) admitted. &quot;But some PPU guards and an airport marshaller were ordered to scare them away.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official admitted that the only marshaller - a person who guides the aircraft in landing and taking off - had joined the guards in the birds scare and the presidential yet had to take off to the skies without his services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Museveni's administration took power in Uganda in 1986, the number of international airlines operating in Entebbe airport, along the shores of Lake Victoria, has almost tripled to about 20 per week.  Companies operating internal flights for tourists and non-governmental organisations have also increased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the population of the birds has also increased during the past several years around the airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The managing director of CAA, Ambrose Akandonda, said Entebbe airport's relative safety was increasingly being threatened by a surging bird population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The location of the airport makes it one of the most ideal airports in the east African region in case there has to be emergency landing.  But this also makes it disadvantageous in that the location attracts numerous birds,&quot; he told reporters recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several civilian and military aircraft have fallen victims to the roaming birds when their engines sucked the birds, forcing the pilots to make emergency landings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most recent scourge of the birds was a Uganda Airlines Boeing 737 with 101 passengers on board, which was forced to make an emergency landing shortly after take off for Dubai when one of its engines sucked in a marabou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, all the passengers and the eight-member crew escaped unhurt. But repairs to the plane's 13 rotor blades cost about 250 million Uganda shillings (250,000 U.S. dollars).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other carriers, like Air France, Ethiopian Airlines and Sabena, had faced similar problems before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Akandonda said CAA had begun shooting the birds at the airport to eliminate aviation accidents. It was also considering the introduction of falcons to hunt and kill off other birds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Falcons are birds with pointed wings and long tails which can be trained to hunt other birds and small animals. Airports like JFK, in New York, with birds problems like Entebbe, use falcons, Akandonda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We began shooting the nuisance birds last week. We are shooting marabou stocks, kites and water ducks. We shoot them mostly in the morning and evening hours when they are most concentrated,&quot; he said. &quot;It is an effective method.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But environmentalists and lovers of birds are up in arms against the shooting of birds, saying it is illegal and must be stopped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commissioner for wildlife in the ministry of tourism, wildlife and antiquities, Moses Okua, said the Entebbe peninsula was gazetted a birds sanctuary long ago, &quot;and rules do not permit killing the birds without authority from the Uganda Wildlife Authority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said CAA had not consulted, nor obtained permission from the relevant authority before deciding to shoot the unwelcome &quot;guests&quot; at Entebbe airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Okua said killing the birds was not a solution to the birds hazard.  The problem should be looked at broadly, including things that attract birds near the airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAA public relations manager James Bitwire said that the aviation authority had commissioned two experts from Makerere university to study the bird ecology in Entebbe and come out with recommendation on how to control the menace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The birds do not come to the run-way or the general airport areas to feed,&quot; said John Bulindi, the principal terminal manager at Entebbe airport. &quot;They come here to relax and sun bathe after feeding from the vicinity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the key to solving the problem, he said, lies in cleaning the vicinity of anything that may attract these birds by way of food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this role, we have to work with other concerned government ministries and private organisations, including Entebbe Municipal Council, which is charged with passing by-laws,&quot; Bulindi said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI, Kenya (PANA) - The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) has said that it backs the continued ban on ivory trade and will defend that stand at all fora where it will be discussed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will be Kenya's official stand at a meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) to be held in Harare, Zimbabwe in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The KWS head of corporate communications, John Mramba, said on Thursday that &quot;our position remains the same - we are totally opposed to the resumption of trade in ivory.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the KWS was planning to hold a workshop next Thursday to finalize a technical document to back Kenya's stand at the Harare meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wildlife conservationists expected a heated &quot;tug-of-tusks&quot; debate in Harare following proposals by Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe that the ban on ivory trade be lifted because their elephant populations were too big.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trade in ivory was banned in 1989 to save the African elephant from extinction, at the hands of poachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three Southern African nations say they possess huge ivory stockpiles they seek to dispose off. Their demand has reportedly won support from the Cites secretariat and several Asian countries known to be markets for elephant tusks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The KWS statement came three days after the London-based Environmental Investigations Agency, and conservationists Perez Olindo and Nehemiah Rotich of Kenya and Cosmas Mlay of Tanzania, asked Kenya to lead the onslaught against the emerging anti-ban tide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya rallied around other stockholders in the global wildlife sector to ban the trade, to save the population of the African elephant, which had declined by about 90 percent in just two decades at the hands of poachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia, which originally sided with other Southern African states in pressing for the lifting of the ivory trade ban, has now changed its position and wants it maintained, to save its elephant population from extermination.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abdul Mahmus Abdul-Halim, who heads the directorate of African affairs in the Sudanese foreign ministry, was quoted by the Sudan News agency (SUNA) on Thursday as saying the mission has been dispatched under the auspices of the OAU mechanism on conflict prevention, management and resolution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the delegation is being headed by Sudan's ambassador to Ethiopia, adding that this was testimony of Khartoum's prominent role in efforts to settle African conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abdul-Halim said the delegation has so far visited Tanzania and was scheduled to tour Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four countries have been teeming with refugees since the assassination of Burundi's democratically-elected Hutu President, Melchior Ndadaye in October 1993 and the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS RELEASE INDEPENDENT ANNUAL REPORT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONDON - The Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the world's largest international oil company, came under attack today from environmental and human rights activists for its activities in Peru and Nigeria, at the same time as the company prepares to fend off a shareholder resolution critical of its policies at its annual meeting tomorrow. In the United States, there will be demonstrations in at least eight cities demanding that Shell improve its human rights perfomance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coinciding with Shell's annual general meeting and the release of the company's first worldwide environmental report, Rainforest Action Network and Project Underground, released their own independent annual report that reveals Shell's destructive environmental practices in Peru and Nigeria. The report, with a blood-spattered Shell logo on the cover, criticizes the company's approach to gas development in Peru, and accuses Shell of making only cosmetic changes to its operations in Nigeria. Two representatives from Peru and Nigeria, Ledum Mites, president of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People and Wrays Perez, secretary of AIDESEP, Peru's largest indigenous federation, will also attend the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1958, Shell has extracted billions worth of oil and natural gas from the Niger River delta area of Nigeria, home to the Ogoni people. As a result, the Ogoni's traditional fishing and farming life has been devastated by oil pollution, and, according to the Wall Street Journal, the land has become a &quot;ravaged environment.&quot; The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development has declared the Niger's mouth as the most endangered river delta in the world - a direct result of nearly four decades of oil exploitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Desiring profits from Shell and other major oil companies, the Nigerian government has been silencing the voices of protest in Ogoniland, to the point of executing human rights activist, poet, and 1995 Goldman Environmental Prize Winner, Ken Saro-Wiwa, and eight fellow activists. The report reveals new information about the destruction of the delta environment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Group Stages Protest Outside Company Headquarters</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May 14, 1997</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONTACT: Stephen Mills, Human Rights and Environment Campaign Director, Sierra Club, 408 C St., NE, Washington, D.C.  20002; tel: 202- 675-6691; e-mail: stephen.mills@sierraclub.org</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington, D.C. -- Amid demonstrators chanting, &quot;No Blood for Oil&quot;, outside Shell Oil's Washington, D.C. lobbying headquarters, members of the Sierra Club pledged today that the nation's oldest and largest grassroots environmental organization will continue its boycott of Shell Oil until the company's rhetoric matches its actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa, Shell has spent millions on public relations and advertising to respond to the public outcry for environmental justice in Ogoni,&quot; said Stephen Mills, Director of the Sierra Club's Human Rights and the Environment Campaign. &quot;But they have yet to admit responsibility for their actions, to pay adequate compensation to villagers whose farms were destroyed, or to clean up their environmental mess in Ogoni. Our boycott campaign will continue until Shell's deeds match their words.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If anything, the situation in Nigeria has worsened,&quot; said Mills. &quot;The Ogoni region is now a military zone and MOSOP has been forced underground.&quot; MOSOP stands for the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People, the environmental and human rights organization led by writer Ken Saro-Wiwa before he was hanged in November of 1995. &quot;Teachers are arrested if they mention Ken Saro-Wiwa in the classroom, preachers are arrested if they mention Ken in church,&quot; said Mills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have new reports that local security forces in Nigeria's main oil-producing region has forced people, often at gunpoint, to sign statements inviting Shell to return to Ogoniland,&quot; said Mills. &quot;The fact is, Shell cannot return to Ogoni until they negotiate with MOSOP, and that will be impossible as long as MOSOP members are forbidden to assemble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At its annual general meeting today in London Shell will be under pressure from church pension funds and Pirc, the U.K.  investment advisory service which holds 12 percent of Shell's stock, to clarify its commitment to environmental protection and human rights. Among the key points in the Pirc shareholder resolution: make someone on the committee of managing directors personally responsible for seeing that Shell honors its commitments to the environment and human rights; establish an effective auditing process to guarantee that words and actions match; and publish a progress report to shareholders, specifically in relation to Shell's operations in Nigeria, by the end of 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shell's Board of Directors advice to shareholders to reject Pirc's resolution has only given environmental and human rights organizations more reason to doubt the company's recently issued business principles that call for a respect for human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Shell has made a great effort in recent weeks to praise its contributions to hospitals in Nigeria. What they won't tell you is that the Ogoni won't go near the hospitals because of their profound fear of the company,&quot; Mills added. &quot;This is nothing more than an attempt to disguise the fact that Shell has yet to adequately address the Ogoni environmental demands that started this whole campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shell first found oil in Nigeria's Ogoniland in 1958. Since that time the company has extracted some $35 billion in oil from the lands of the Ogoni people. While royalties from these sales fill the coffers of the Nigerian military dictatorship, the rich farmland and rivers of Ogoniland have been poisoned by oil spills and the venting of toxic gases. Meanwhile most Ogoni today still lack running water , electricity, adequate schools or health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nineteen Ogoni men are now awaiting trial for the same murders for which Ken Saro-Wiwa was wrongly tried and hanged,&quot; said Mills, &quot;some are suffering in detention from blindness, disease and torture. We are demanding that Shell use their considerable influence to see that the Ogoni 19 are released.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental and human rights advocates believe Ken Saro- Wiwa was killed because of the international campaign he led against the pollution in his homeland caused by Shell, one of the largest revenue producers for the military junta that rules Nigeria. The Nigerian military government, an international pariah, has refused to release the body of Saro-Wiwa and eight others it executed, to the families. The regime maintains a strong presence in Ogoniland, beating and jailing any Ogoni who dares speak Saro-Wiwa's name or attempts to organize others to protect the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigeria Country Report on Human Rights, released in January by the U.S. Department of State, noted that &quot;General Abacha's Government relied regularly on arbitrary detention and harassment to silence its many critics.&quot; That report is available on the internet at http://www.state.gov/www/issues/human_rights/1996_hrp_report &nbsp;/nigeria.html.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the protest the group distributed specially designed postcards for citizens to sign and send to Shell and President Clinton.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CRIMES OF SHELL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Shell oil corporation has blood on its hands, and a worldwide boycott of Shell products is under way. Two recent reports(1,2) on the Shell subsidiary in Nigeria, Africa, have documented massive environmental destruction in the Niger River delta region, where Shell has spilled some 56 million gallons of oil onto farmlands and into community water supplies.(1,pg.45) The destroyed land and water formerly provided sustenance for an indigenous people, the Ogoni. A recent video confirms these reports of Shell's environmental abuse and mismanagement in Ogoniland.(3)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Shell's crimes are deeper still. When Ogoni activists organized to demand that Shell clean up spilled oil, and share oil profits more equitably with the Ogoni people, the Nigerian military dictatorship --with financial assistance, logistical support, and guns provided by Shell(1,pgs.23,43,91-92) -- conducted a campaign of terror in which at least 1800 Ogoni people were murdered, some of them tortured to death.(1,pg.95)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ogoni peoples' struggle against Shell burst into headlines November 10, 1995, when the Nigerian dictatorship executed 9 Ogoni environmental activists, including Ken Saro- Wiwa. Saro-Wiwa had received the Goldman Environmental Prize for Africa April 17, 1995 in recognition of his environmental work on behalf of the Ogoni people. Saro-Wiwa had also received the Right Livelihood Award December 9, 1994.(1,pg.95) Both awards are said to carry prestige equivalent to the Nobel peace prize. In addition to being an environmentalist and community leader, Saro-Wiwa was well-known in his homeland, and internationally, as a poet and essayist.(4) His last words, just as he was executed by hanging, were, &quot;Lord, take my soul but the struggle continues!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within weeks of the executions, Shell contracted with the Nigerian dictatorship to build a large liquefied natural gas plant, thus sending a signal that it was business as usual for Shell and that Shell was continuing to support the military dictatorship.(2,pg.10)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the World Council of Churches, key witnesses for the prosecution at Ken Saro-Wiwa's trial have signed sworn affidavits saying they were bribed by Shell to testify against Saro-Wiwa.(1,pg.43)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since late 1995, the dictatorship has been holding 19 more Ogoni environmental activists, charged with the same crime for which the Ogoni 9 were executed. The World Council of Churches reported in late 1996 that, &quot;...as a result of the inhuman treatment, torture, denial of medical care, starvation and poor sanitary conditions, most of the detainees are in very poor health.&quot;(1,pg.75)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ogoni people --500,000 of them(1,pg.8) --inhabit a 404- square-mile-area called the Rivers State in Nigeria in west Africa. They represent 0.05% of the Nigerian population, so they are a tiny minority. Ken Saro-Wiwa compared the Ogoni to other indigenous people around the world: the Aborigines of Australia, the Maori of New Zealand, and the native people of North and South America. &quot;Their common history is of the usurpation of their land and resources, the destruction of their culture, and the eventual decimation of the people,&quot; he wrote.(1,pg.19) Since 1958, $30 billion worth of oil has been taken from beneath the land of the Ogoni, yet essentially zero benefits have accrued to the Ogoni themselves. When the World Council of Churches sent observers to Ogoniland in 1995, they found no piped water supplies, no good roads, no electricity, no telephones, and no proper health care facilities.(1,pg.24) Further, they reported that, in oil-rich Ogoniland, gasoline is hand-pumped from a cement holding tank into large plastic containers, then poured into a smaller can with a long neck, from which the gasoline is finally poured into a vehicle's gas tank. Such is the state of modernization made possible by Shell's post-modern colonial venture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shell, a Dutch company, is the 10th largest corporation in the world, and No. 1 in profitability.(2,pg.4) Shell has 96 oil production wells in Ogoniland, 5 flow stations (large pumping stations), and numerous gas flares which have operated continuously for 35 years.(1,pg.31) In addition, Shell maintains many high-pressure oil pipelines criss-crossing Ogoniland, carrying oil from other parts of Nigeria to the shipping terminal at Bonny.(1,pg.32) In response to growing pressure for reform in Ogoniland in 1993, Shell ceased oil production there, but retained its network of pipelines carrying oil produced elsewhere in Nigeria. (The World Council of Churches finds evidence that Shell has not in fact ceased oil production in Ogoniland,(1,pgs.31-33) but Shell insists its production wells are idle.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between 1976 and 1980, Shell operations caused 784 separate oil spills in Nigeria.(1,pg.45). From 1982 to 1992, 27 additional spills were recorded. Since Shell &quot;ceased oil production&quot; in Ogoniland in 1993, Shell admits another 24 oil spills have occurred there.(1,pg.33)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shell operates in 100 countries, but 40% of all its oil spills have occurred in Nigeria.(1,pg.28) Shell says the spills result from &quot;sabotage&quot; but the World Council of Churches reports &quot;there has not been one single piece of evidence produced by Shell to back up its claims that oil spills in Ogoniland were caused by sabotage.&quot;(1,pg.39)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shell controls at least 60% of all the oil reserves in Nigeria and oil accounts for 80% of Nigeria's total revenues and 90% of its foreign exchange earnings.(1,pg.44) As a result, Shell is an extremely powerful political force in Nigeria. The World Council of Churches has described a revolving door -- Shell executives becoming Nigerian political officials, and Nigerian political officials becoming Shell employees.(1,pg.44) However, Shell maintains that it has no political influence and cannot affect the fate of political prisoners in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shell admits to 3000 polluted sites affected by oil operations on Ogoni soil. According to the World Council of Churches, Shell also admits to flaring 1.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas each day for 35 years, causing acid rain in the Niger delta during about 10% of the days each year.(1,pg.41) Furthermore, the flares produce a rain of fine particles, a cancer-causing soot that permeates everything --land water, homes, lungs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shell's environmental abuses in Ogoniland came as a shock to observers sent by the World Council of Churches. They wrote, &quot;Having followed all the events in Ogoniland, reading all the reports and seeing the videos such as DRILLING FIELDS and DELTA FORCE3, did not prepare us for the devastation we saw at the numerous spill sites we visited,&quot; they wrote.(1,pg.24)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers from the World Council of Churches describe a site where Shell had spilled oil in 1969: &quot;Even though this spill occurred 26 years ago, its devastating impact is still very apparent,&quot; they wrote.(1,pg.34) &quot;The soil and oil are caked together into a thick black crust which covers the area. Liquid crude oil is still present in deep crevices (2 to 3 feet deep), formed in spots where trees once stood... The air remains polluted by the vapour from the spilled crude oil; this becomes particularly noticeable when the south-west wind blows. The oil spill seems to have polluted the creek nearby. The oil flowed into the body of water and we were told that it can still be seen floating on the surface of the creek water that people still drink. We were unable to move near the creek as the earth was dangerously soggy with a combination of soil, oil, and water... It is amazing that so much devastation exists after 26 years.&quot;(1,pg.34)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the death of Ken Saro-Wiwa, his brother, Dr. Owens Wiwa, has been touring the world describing the Ogoni peoples' struggle against the combined forces of Shell and the military dictators of Nigeria. Dr. Wiwa, an articulate, soft-spoken physician, was himself held prisoner (without charges) by Nigerian authorities on more than one occasion.(1,pg.93) He is now a political exile living in Toronto, Canada, though most of his time is spent on the road, urging people to boycott Shell products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late March of this year, U.S. environmental justice activists met in Atlanta, Georgia to discuss environmental justice struggles across the U.S. and abroad. Dr. Wiwa gave the keynote address. &quot;Our people are dying at the hands of our government and Shell Oil,&quot; Dr. Wiwa told the assembled activists in Atlanta. Dr. Robert D. Bullard, a well-known environmental justice leader and author of CONFRONTING ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM: VOICES FROM THE GRASSROOTS, told the Atlanta meeting, &quot;the quest for healthy and sustainable communities and environmental justice does not stop at U.S.  borders... we have a moral and ethical obligation to direct our collective action and purchasing power to respond to Dr. Wiwa and the Ogoni's struggle in Nigeria, just as we responded to the oppression of apartheid in South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked recently what Americans could do to help the Ogoni people, Dr. Wiwa gave four recommendations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Boycott Shell. Do not buy ANY Shell products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Encourage selective purchasing contracts, such as the one now in force in Oakland, California. Last fall the Oakland City Council passed a city-wide ordinance prohib-iting the city from doing business with Nigeria. Dr. Wiwa is urging all city councils to adopt selective purchasing laws to prevent their city from investing in or trading with Nigeria OR ANY COMPANIES CARRYING OUT BUSINESS IN NIGERIA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Pressure Congress to impose sanctions against Nigeria, just as the U.S. has recently done against Burma for human rights abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Contact the president of Shell's U.S. subsidiary: Philip J. Carroll, Shell Oil Company, P.O. Box 2463, Houston, TX 77252; (800) 248-4257; fax (713) 241-4044.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Carroll may respond that Shell's U.S. subsidiary has nothing to do with what's happening in Nigeria. But 10% of Shell's profits come from its U.S. operations, so the U.S.  subsidiary has major clout with its Dutch parent corporation.  Refusal to exercise that clout is a moral failure. Up to now, Mr. Carroll himself has blood on his hands, in our view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if Mr. Carroll cannot understand the moral argument, you could tell him you will be boycotting Shell's products until they clean up their environmental mess in Nigeria and fully compensate the Ogoni people for past damages and injustices. Mr. Carroll will certainly understand the meaning of &quot;boycott.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - It isn't a problem that parliamentary deputy speaker Baleka Mbete-Kgositsile was given special treatment and driven to Delmas to be tested for her learners and drivers licenses at State expense, the Moldenhauer Commission heard late on Wednesday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While conceding that the trip was a personal matter, Mpumalanga safety and security MEC, Steve Mabona, insisted that the deputy speaker deserved the extra expense as a sign of respect for her position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though this was a personal matter, it was an official trip and it is right and proper that the taxpayer should pay for it because both Mbete-Kgositsile and I are civil servants 24-hours a day and have to be guarded,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I just cannot understand why this matter has been blown out of proportion ... I can think of no other reason than internal character assassination.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabona, who testified for the first time on Wednesday after being booked off work for one week with stress, also denied that he was responsible for corruption committed by officials within his department because they were &quot;undisciplined&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabona did confirm, however, that he had personally organised for Mbete-Kgositsile to be tested because of her &quot;tight schedule&quot; after she approached him and explained that she was having difficulty constantly travelling between Cape Town and Johannesburg for ANC national executive committee meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was unable, however, to explain why she had not instead been tested nearer her office in Cape Town or nearer the ANC headquarters in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why Mpumalanga? It's out of her way. Why you and not some other more relevant MEC. Is this not just re-inforcing the image that it is easier to get your license in this province that elsewhere in South Africa,&quot; asked Commission chairman, chief magistrate Heinrich Moldenhauer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabona was unable to explain why no official records had been kept of Mbete-Kgositsile's tests, why the necessary fees were only paid in 28 days after the license was issued and why notification of the license was only sent to the Department of Home Affairs six months after the licenses were issued instead of within the two days prescribed by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabona was also unable to explain why copies of all internal reports and other documentation, including copies of her test results, were faxed through to Mbete-Kgositsile immediately after the Sunday Times broke the story four weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am shocked and at very surprised. This is wrong. and it is the first time I have seen this type of thing ... we have a problem with our management,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conceding that he was still not in complete control of his own department after three years, Mabona agreed that he was unable to instill discipline in his directors and other junior staff and was therefore unable to effectively fight corruption within the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evoking biblical verses against the &quot;devil's evil tricks&quot; and the &quot;wicked spiritual forces in this heavenly world&quot;, Mabona however denied that he was only paying lip service to the fight against corruption and instead again accused the press of sentationalising instances of corruption in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite initially denying that there were any substantial irregularities, Mabona later rounded on provincial traffic director Henry Brazer during cross examination by magistrate Moldenhauer and said that a number of Brazer's actions while issuing the licenses to Mbete-Kgositsile were &quot;very disturbing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This included the use of incorrect application forms and license certificates and the lack of official records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabona also accused Brazer of misleading him after the first press reports by insisting that everything had been legal and &quot;above board&quot;, prompting Mabona to be overly critical of the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabona failed however to explain why he had failed to institute an immediate internal investigation into the issue after Sunday Times broke the story four weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Not everything in the press is true you know, maybe they were lying for their own purposes. The press is certainly not helping government by writing things such as this and I still believe that the issue was sensationalised,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a difference between a fake license and one issued irregularly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agreeing to retract some of his accusations of racist and other hidden agendas against the reporter who uncovered the story, Mabona however refused to apologise for all his &quot;harsh statements&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pointing out that neither he nor department head, advocate Stanley Soko, had managed to even get officials in their head office to sign attendance registers or log in and out when leaving the office, Mabona said that every time they tried to implement control measures officials objected to &quot;being treated like children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There seem to be many problems and short comings in your department that you either do not know of or cannot control.  This is costing South Africa huge amounts of money and lives on our roads,&quot; commented Moldenhauer.  Pointing to previous evidence, Moldenhauer also asked why, if Mabona was against the recruitment of license applicants from KwaZulu Natal and the Eastern Cape by driving schools, he had organised for Mbete- Kgositsile to come from even further away in Cape Town to be tested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabona denied that the two issues could be leaked, insisting that as a senior government official Mbete-Kgositsile's case was different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have a serious problem when all these officials come here to this commission to complain. I am the politician here and I didn't even know about these things - is it people trying to sabotage the department?&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moldenhauer warned that he would not hesitate to take &quot;the strongest possible action&quot; should anyone who testified before the Commission be victimised or otherwise compromised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazer is scheduled to testify on Thursday but Moldenhauer reserved the right to recall Mabona to clarify certain issues which had still not been resolved.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - National Parks Board chairman and respected former homeland leader, Dr Enos Mabuza, is being probed by the most powerful government investigative unit in South Africa for a State farm he bought for R 6 000 in 1991 and mortgaged for almost R500 000 two years later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two previous provincial government investigations into the sale were stalled last year after records allegedly went missing and former homeland officials refused to co-operate with either the Auditor General or the province's director general, Frank Mbatha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports on the issue in the Mail &amp; Guardian however, prompted Judge W? Heath to bring his special investigative unit to Mpumalanga this week to begin interviewing officials and to visit Mabuza's farm and three other properties near Barberton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All four farms were sold to &quot;political incumbents&quot; in 1991 without tender board approval or public auction and were sold for only the legal transfer costs of between R6045 and R7500 each.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Deeds of Registrar's Office, Mabuza mortgaged his property for R480 000 two years later, with agricultural economists pointing out that the farm's true market value would be far higher as banks always keep a 35% reserve on mortgaged properties to protect themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Auditors are concerned that the State had made absolutely no money out of the deal, which was described as a &quot;gesture of thanks for our service by a grateful people&quot; at the time by Mabuza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three other recipients are still serving politicians, including South Africa's current ambassador to Mozambique Mangisi Zitha, member of Parliament Professor Simon Ripinga and member of Mpumalanga's House of Traditional Leaders Tikhontele Dlamini.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fallout from the investigation could also include Mpumalanga's speaker of the Legislature, Elias Ginindza, who signed the power of attorney authorising the sale while he was minister of the interior in KaNgwane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Heath's special unit, which was created in November 1996 after the success of his commission into corruption in the Eastern Cape, has the same executive civil powers as a High Court and has already reputedly recovered or saved the government R10-billion through its &quot;search &amp; seizure&quot; operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assisted by a special tribunal of three High Court judges, the unit has the power to initiate its own investigations, serve summons for civil action and pass judgement to either reclaim former State assets or goods to their value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other than the investigation into Mabuza's farm, the unit has also just served an eviction notice on former PAC leader Clarence Makwetu after discovering that he is 'squatting' on a government owned farm in the Eastern Cape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Makwetu has occupied the farm for years and has built a house on it, he never obtained a lease for the property. He may be required to demolish the house, at his own expense, before vacating the farm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unit has also discovered that former Transkei military leader, General Bantu Holomisa and his military council irregularly promoted themselves just one day before 1994's historic elections to qualify for better military pensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Judge Heath, the government is loosing an amount of roughly R342 400 per month because of the promotions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Heath and his investigation unit head, Jon Dutton met with Mpumalanga's provincial Auditor General, various retired homeland officials who were involved in the sales and with the departments of Land Affairs and Local Government in Nelspruit on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were however unable to meet with Premier Mathews Phosa to inform him that the unit would start operating in Mpumalanga, despite attempting to set up an appointment with him for two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After the visit this week, we have also found a number of other issues which may need investigation in the province, including various other land deals,&quot; said Judge Heath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A full team from the unit will set up office in the province within the next month or two.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DELMAS - A Telkom van was set alight and the roads in Botleng, near Delmas, barracaded with burning tyres by pupils and teachers demanding that schools in the area be transferred from Mpumalanga into Gauteng, police said on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provincial police spokesperson, Captain Benjamin Bhembe, said pupils were led by teacher, Jubi Makabane of Phaphamani High School, who said he wanted to meet with the Local Government MECs of both provinces to discuss the issue.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The protest was unauthorised and no notice was given to the authorities that the demonstration was to take place,&quot; Capt Bhembe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said about 100 pupils went on the rampage from 8:45am to 3:50pm and stoned policemen who had to fire on the crowd with teargas and rubber bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One demonstrator sustained minor injuries when he was shot in the foot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capt Bhembe said several violent incidents had taken place around Delmas since Tuesday when Botleng residents first marched to the Delmas town council offices demanding to be included in Gauteng.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Both the licenses which were secretly issued to parliamentary deputy speaker Baleka Mbete-Kgositsile by Mpumalanga traffic authorities last year October are irregular, the Moldenhauer Commission was told on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission was also told by provincial traffic director Henry Brazer that political interference had paralyzed his fight against corruption and that the MEC for safety and security, Steve Mabona, seemed to be staffing the department almost exclusively with people from KwaNdebele.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabona is a former KwaNdebele home-land minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbete-Kgositsile was issued the licenses last year by special arrangement of Mabona, who sent his state car and personal bodyguards to fetch the deputy speaker from Johannesburg to Delmas for the tests.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpumalanga traffic director Henry Brazer confirmed on Thursday that he was booked off sick with heart problems on October 1, but drove 350km to Delmas to test Mbete-Kgositsile after he was &quot;ordered&quot; to by Mabona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would not have driven to Delmas to give Mbete-Kgositsile a license if it had not been a direct order from the MEC, because it is an abnormal request,&quot; explained Brazer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I was continually told that my position was threatened and Mabona himself told me on occasion that unless I obeyed orders he would have me replaced. So, how far do you question or oppose such a boss?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazer however admitted that he failed to follow the all regulations as set out in the KaNgwane Road Traffic Act itself and had neglected to ask Mbete-Kgositsile to perform an emergency hand-brake stop and a three-point turn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also could not remember if he had tested her knowledge of all the traffic signs or even if he had asked her to stop and pull off from robots or traffic lights in Delmas, as testified by Mbete-Kgositsile two weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to separate evidence before the Commission, there are no traffic lights at all in Delmas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazer readily admitted that he had actually only completed half of the practical driver performance test form while with Mbete-Kgositsile in Delmas but insisted that it was not a problem that he had filled the rest in later, because the test form was &quot;only a rough guide&quot;. He could not remember where he actually completed the form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I agree that the Act stipulates that all the aspects of the test have to be done or the whole thing is void, but in my opinion the deputy speaker can drive very well,&quot; he insisted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She told me, and it was obvious, that she had driven a lot while in exile. I gave her a license on the basis of this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During cross examination, Brazer also admitted that he had failed to file the test results and other documentation as required by law and that he only sent them to Home Affairs for registration on the Population Register after Sunday Times first reported on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Denying earlier charges by Mabona that he was incapable of making his own decisions, Brazer accused Mabona of allowing Driving Schools from KwaNdebele to gain virtual control of the traffic division by &quot;bending over backwards and ordering us to co-operate with their every wish&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mabona is very sensitive about KwaNdebele and so I leave all issues from there for him to decide on. This doesn't mean that I couldn't run my department, it means that political interference made it almost impossible to achieve anything,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazer also charged Mabona with irregularly appropriating portions of his budget for travel and hotel expenses for Mabona's bodyguards and other staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This money, which may have run into the thousands of rands, was taken away from our already under financed section, meaning that our officers could no longer patrol the roads properly or work overtime,&quot; he charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Departmental finance heads explained that Mabona's 1996/ 97 budget had been finished before the year end and so they were forced to appropriate ours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission concluded hearing testimony on Wednesday with a short statement from Mabona asking the commission to be very strict in its rulings, which will be delivered to Premier Mathews Phosa on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUSHBUCKRIDGE - Two bakkies were burnt at Marite near Bushbuckridge on Thursday as part of the ongoing riots in the area where residents are demanding to be incorporated into Mpumalanga, said Northern Province police spokesperson, Captain Thomas Ramatseba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the bakkies, one of which was transporting furniture, were burnt after about 20 000 residents again rioted, believing national minister of constitutional affairs, Valli Moosa, failed for to address them for a third time.  According to Bushbuckridge border committee member, Enos Maunye, the committee received a fax late Wednesday, stating that Moosa, deputy minister of environmental affairs, Trevor Mokaba, and minister for safety and security, Sydney Mufamadi, would no longer be able to make Thursday's meeting.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fax arrived too late to cancel Thursday's mass meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC spokesperson, Ronnie Mamoepa, explained that the three ministers first had to table their annual budget reports before visiting the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moosa was expected to address residents on May 1, but failed to do so, apparently sparking the initial riots and barricading of roads to the Kruger National Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He denied he was ever scheduled to address the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the border committee has raised R15 000 to hire a lawyer to represent them in court when the border issue is taken further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maunye said the money had been raised by collecting donations of R100 from local businesses, and R10 from private homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sgt Ramatseba said police were collecting rubble used by residents in Bushbuckridge to blockade roads, but that youths continued to line the streets, waiting for police to pass, so that more barricades could be erected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, in Groblersdal, no incidents of violence have been reported in the past 24 hours, said Captain Frans Mojapelo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At Tafelkop, people tried to barricade a road with stones, but police were able to remove them and the road was reopened,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Political disregard for normal government procedures or discipline in Mpumalanga's department of safety &amp; security are at the root of the province's rampant license fraud and corruption, the Moldenhauer Commission heard during its final day of hearings on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This same disregard for established procedures and alleged intimidation are what led to parliamentary deputy speaker Baleka Mbete-Kgositsile being issued invalid learners and drivers licenses, said the man who tested her, traffic director Henry Brazer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazer, whose testimony has been postponed twice after he was hospitalised last week with a stress related heart ailment, told the Commission in Nelspruit that he would ordinarily never have given Mbete-Kgositsile special treatment or issued her with the two licenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was, however, forced, to interrupt a two week sick leave and drive to Delmas to test the deputy speaker after receiving direct telephonic orders to do so from safety &amp; security MEC, Steve Mabona, he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabona has confirmed that he ordered Brazer to facilitate the test and also that he sent his state issue car and personal bodyguards to Johannesburg to drive Mbete-Kgositsile to Delmas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabona and Brazer, however, attacked each other in their separate submissions to the Commission, both accusing the other of links with corrupt driving schools, of being &quot;undisciplined&quot; and of engaging in various forms of irregularities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazer also charged that Mabona's political interference extended to the &quot;unheard of&quot; appropriation of a significant portion of the traffic division's 1996/ 97 budget to pay for hotel accommodation, vehicle hire and other travel expenses for Mabona, his bodyguards and other &quot;civilian&quot; personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This had become necessary, he said, because Mabona's office had used up its entire annual budget by mid-year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although declining to put a figure on the appropriation, Brazer said it ran into the thousands of rands and had forced him to curtail the normal patrol duties of his traffic officers and had also forced his to slash overtime allowances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The continual political interference also paralyzed Brazer's fight against corruption which, he insisted, was supported by files of documentation he submitted. a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabona also seemed to be staffing the department almost exclusively with people from KwaNdebele., creating &quot;vehement&quot; resistance from SiSwati and white staff and also creating a climate of fear that staff could be fired for dis-obeying Mabona's orders or resisting his wishes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabona is a former KwaNdebele home-land minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would not have driven to Delmas to give Mbete-Kgositsile a license if it had not been a direct order from the MEC, because it is an abnormal request,&quot; explained Brazer.</SPAN></P>

An ICRC team from Brazzaville which carried out a survey in Liranga between 8 and 12 May found that over 3,000 refugees had been registered by the local authorities and several hundred more were arriving in the area each day. On the other side of the river, upwards of 20,000 are said to be waiting to cross -- provided they can pay local boatmen for the passage. Those with no money, or who are too sick to go any further, are left behind in Zaire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karen Thibaud, a member of the ICRC team on the spot, said the refugees were physically exhausted and malnourished. &quot;There are likely to be many more crossing in the coming days, and they will need help urgently. We shall try to meet their immediate needs, but if we are to assist them in the longer term they will have to leave this area, which is barely suitable as a place of transit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 12 May the ICRC sent a first helicopter-load of food to Liranga. The following day a cargo plane arrived in the Congolese capital, Brazzaville, with 11 tonnes of high-protein biscuits, medical supplies and water/sanitation material. This will be taken by a smaller aircraft to Lukolela, a missionary station with an airstrip some 80 kilometres south of Liranga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICRC is in contact with the Congolese authorities, UNHCR and other organizations with a view to coordinating the operation for the refugees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(BEGIN DIATTA TEXT)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. President,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allow me first of all to transmit to you the friendly greetings of his Excellency Ibrahim Mainassara Bare, President of the Republic of Niger, together with his best wishes for your complete success in fulfilling the weighty responsibility of presiding over the destiny of the United States of America, this great nation that remains in the forefront of the struggle for peace, freedom, and progress throughout the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is by such a standard that I measure the privilege and great honor conferred upon me by my accreditation to your Excellency as Ambassador of my country, which, as you know, has a tradition of friendship with yours that draws its vitality from the esteem and solidarity that prevail between the American people and the people of Niger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is amply demonstrated by the constant presence in Niger of numerous American Peace Corps volunteers, living and working side by side with the rural population to help them establish better living conditions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These volunteers, by their effectiveness and complete integration into our village communities, have won a special place in the hearts of the men and women of Niger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This sincere friendship has made it possible to develop fruitful cooperation between our two countries, allowing the government of my country to benefit from the generous assistance of the United States in areas such as agriculture, health, management of natural resources, and food security, all sectors that contribute greatly to enhancing the capacity of the people to meet the challenge of sustainable development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This fortunate bilateral cooperation is achieved just as harmoniously at the multilateral level, where our two governments, inspired by the principles of the United Nations Charter, regularly join forces to work for the establishment of an international order based on peace, respect for international law, and the advancement of peoples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. President,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After several consecutive years of unprecedented recession, the state of our national economy, with development indicators among the lowest in the world, continues to give cause for concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, thanks to the implementation of a courageous program of adjustment and economic reforms, recovery is starting to take hold. It is still insufficient, however, to make noticeable inroads in the poverty that ravages our society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ibrahim Mainassara Bare and his government remain, therefore, determined to consolidate the conditions necessary for the recovery and restored growth of our national economy, in particular by continuing the efforts under way in the following priority areas:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Stepping up policies and measures to rehabilitate public finance and improve the macro-economic context, with the goal of consolidating our country's renewed credibility with the Bretton Woods institutions;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Improving significantly the standard of living in rural areas, with the goal of reducing poverty;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Promoting and developing private enterprise in profitable growth sectors, with the goal of creating capital and jobs as a basis for establishing genuine conditions of self-sustaining growth and achieving meaningful solutions to the thorny problem of poverty. To give this policy for the development of productive activities a real chance of success, a policy to encourage the mobilization of domestic savings and to attract the foreign capital needed to finance development will also be implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, the government is pursuing without letup its democratization process, as demonstrated by the establishment of democratically elected institutions, and by its determination to observe and enforce the observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Within such a democratic framework, the government hopes to ensure that its economic program will have the best chance of success and to enhance the cohesiveness of our society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. President,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I begin my mission in your country, my hope is that the close cooperation existing between our two governments may be given new impetus in order to enrich the ties between us and improve our mutual understanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I should therefore like, for my part, to assure you that my colleagues at the Embassy and I myself will be eager to work in close cooperation with the appropriate authorities of your government, so that friendship and cooperation between the United States and Niger may reach a level commensurate with the aspirations and expectations of our respective peoples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is therefore with profound confidence in a promising future for our bilateral relations that I have the honor to deliver to your Excellency the letter of recall of my distinguished predecessor, Ambassador Adamou Seydou, as well as the letter by which his Excellency Ibrahim Mainassara Bare accredits me to you as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Niger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long live friendship and cooperation between Niger and the United States of America!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(END DIATTA TEXT)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(BEGIN CLINTON TEXT)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ambassador:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am pleased to accept the better of Credence issued by President Ibrahim Mainassara Bare, appointing you Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Niger to the United States of America. I also acknowledge the better of Recall of your predecessor, Ambassador Adamou Seydou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I extend a warm welcome to you upon your return to the United States. Many American colleagues fondly remember your previous assignment. I hope you will take every opportunity to renew those relationships and to build new ones. I also hope that working together, we can restore our relations to what they once were and more importantly, to what they should be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On behalf of the American people, I offer my best wishes for good health and happiness to all the people of Niger. I also welcome this opportunity to express our respect and concern for them. We believe, and they believe, that only democracy and respect for human rights will bring the development and prosperity all Nigeriens so richly deserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ambassador, I know you will be very busy, and I wish you every success in this important assignment. Again, congratulations and welcome.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call to the business community to promote the bid in the final months of the race has been made by the Cape Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chamber president Ali Gierdien said the Games were &quot;a must&quot; for the Peninsula, an opportunity to launch a &quot;30-year development programme that will significantly improve our infrastructure and economic performance, underpin our tourism industry and serve to unite South Africans&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Games should not be seen merely as a 14-day track and field event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the Chamber was &quot;satisfied that Cape Town can afford the Games without impacting negatively on ratepayers&quot;.  &quot;Budgetary plans for capital as well as operating expenditure are evaluated by the Chamber on a continuous basis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as the International Olympic Committee was concerned, Cape Town's technical capacity to host the Games had been accepted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But visiting IOC members &quot;essentially want to feel the vibe of the city, and judge whether we have what it takes to host Africa's first Olympic Games&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With this in mind, city businesses should approach the Bid Company for bunting and flags to create a colourful display of support.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - A powerful government thrust is set to boost lobbying for the Olympic bid internationally, and to reinforce support at home as the countdown to the September 5 deadline ticks away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Bid Company concentrates on visits to Cape Town by International Olympic Committee members about 54 of whose votes will be needed if the city is to win a high-powered committee of cabinet ministers and deputies is to take the message abroad, concentrating particularly on about 50 IOC members in Africa, Asia and Latin America. This will include strategic efforts by President Mandela and his deputy Thabo Mbeki.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee will be chaired by Sport Minister Steve Tshwete, and will include Mineral and Energy Minister Penuell Maduna, Agriculture Minister Derek Hanekom, Water Affairs Minister Kader Asmal, Public Works Minister Jeff Radebe and Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Aziz Pahad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's embassies and high commissions throughout the world are being mobilised to promote Africa's Olympic hopes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Tshwete's committee - which is also to serve as a channel of communication between the Bid Company and the Cabinet will be advised by Sam Ramsamy, president of the National Olympic Committee of South Africa (Nocsa) and Mr Mbeki's legal adviser, Mojunku Gumbi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee is to co-ordinate its activities with the Bid Company, and liaise daily with the deputy president's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new committee's activities are to be financed, independently of the Government, through a special fund created from donations from foreign companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All ministers and deputy ministers travelling overseas in the next four months are to be briefed to promote the bid, and draw media attention to the developmental logic of South Africa's Olympic programme. The government team is also to go out of its way to highlight the fact that Africa has never been given a chance to host the Games in the modern Olympic movement's 100-year history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Tshwete yesterday described South Africa's chances of winning the bid as being &quot;quite bright&quot;, but indicated that the Cabinet was anxious now to strengthen the bid during the critical lobbying phase, and to tackle the international doubts about political stability in the wake of Mr Mandela's eventual departure.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Seething tensions within the National Party about the disbanding of the Roelf Meyer task team were expected to be at the fore of today's meeting of the Nationalist parliamentary caucus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Urgent talks have been held this week in an attempt to ensure that Mr Meyer accepts his fate within the party on the terms set by NP leader FW de Klerk - to stay on as an ordinary MP.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The talks were held between Mr De Klerk and Olaus van Zyl of the Gauteng party executive, which on Monday decided to urge Mr Meyer to remain within the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Meyer, Gauteng leader of the NP, will announce his decision on his political future at the provincial head council meeting on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indications are that his departure from the party would be unlikely, given the constitutional provision that MPs who quit their parties lose their parliamentary seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Mr Meyer - and anyone who followed him - to leave would mean going into the political wilderness with few resources to continue a quest for political realignment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The &quot;silence&quot; of the African National Congress about the murder of more than 420 leaders and thousands of supporters of the Inkatha Freedom Party is unacceptable, says IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement yesterday, Chief Buthelezi said he welcomed the ANC's admission to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that its units had plotted to assasinate him.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This vindicates my grievances at that time and the actions I took to protect my life and the stability of the government over which I presided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that the ANC leadership intervened to stop the execution of these assassination plans proves that they were aware of them and their intervention may have been caused by the fact that I publicly exposed their plans timeously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Buthelezi also rejected the ANC's argument that it had never regarded the IFP as a military target, saying ANC documents, radio broadcasts and statements by senior ANC leaders had proved otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South Africa must make a commitment to seek and expose the identity of those who killed IFP leaders, whose deaths were the product of a well-planned strategy and not of sporadic 'community violence',&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was responding to a question by commission deputy chairman Alex Boraine, who said torture had been &quot;routine and widespread&quot; in South Africa under the previous government and many people had not been surprised at the confessions of senior policemen.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - With starry-eyed dreams, she started out on her musical career as a tiny six-year-old performing at a gospel concert with her church choir. Today that little girl has become a confident young woman who is being widely tipped to make it big on the international music stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belinda Davids has come a long way since her humble beginnings and has had a whirlwind trip to the top of the local music scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bubbly 20-year-old from the Friendly City of Port Elizabeth has certainly made an impact on the local nightclub scene with her vibrant stage presence and a voice capable of mixing it up with the best musicians in the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since her musical debut in that modest church hall, she has progressed rapidly and recently released her debut album, called simply Belinda Davids, after having signed a record deal with Tusk Records.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her debut single, We Go Together, has received plenty of airtime on most radio stations and the music video of this song has also been aired on national television many times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She has followed this up with her second single, My Life, which has also received plenty of airtime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belinda specialises in rhythm and blues music and loves nothing more than getting a nightclub crowd going with her upbeat dance numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, she has a versatile voice and is equally adept at belting out soulful ballads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gospel music was an integral part of her musical make-up while growing up, but the shape of her musical career was altered when she joined a jazz band in Port Elizabeth called Maiden Voyage at the age of 16 and started playing at nightclubs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She showed tremendous promise and entered Radio Algoa's On the Go Show</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">talent search competition - which she duly won. From there her musical career really took off and she has been playing in clubs and concerts throughout the country, with her music generally being well received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belinda has recently decided to make Cape Town her home and is a well-known face on the Peninsula music scene, having played in many of Cape Town's premier jazz clubs, including Galaxy, Images, Niveau and Leibro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many years Cape Town musicians have bemoaned the fact that they are forced by nightclub management to play an endless number of cover songs, with little opportunity to play original music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When performing, Belinda plays a high percentage of cover versions of popular songs, but feels it is important to also filter in some of her own music in order to get people used to her style.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To get the vibe going at nightclubs you have to play cover versions. When people go out they want to dance and they want to dance to music they know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, I sing my own music as much as I can because I want people to get used to it,&quot; says Belinda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While in Cape Town, she has joined up with local jazz band Sounds of Soul and together they have been entertaining the crowds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She moved to Cape Town to further her career, as she felt she could get more exposure in the city to help realise her dream of recording an album overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her line of work, being a nomad is pretty much part of the territory, but her move to the Mother City has represented a challenge she is relishing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cape Town is a beautiful place, I really like it a lot. The prospects for jobs here are also much better. There are not too many clubs in PE and everyone there already knows me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Moving to Cape Town is a fresh experience for me. I like to go to places where people do not know me and can get to know me,&quot; said Belinda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While she was growing up, Whitney Houston was a tremendous influence on her career and recently the music of Toni Braxton and Anita Baker has inspired her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She lists Cape Town singer Vicky Sampson as her favourite local artist and is also a fan of the Gauteng duo MarcAlex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her face lights up as she says that she would dearly love to have American producer Brian McKnight produce an album for her in the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the moment it is not inconceivable to imagine her working with these popular international artists - but at first the future did not look too rosy for Belinda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She grew up in a family of seven children in the rough Port Elizabeth suburb of Gelvandale - notorious for its high crime rate and rampant gangsterism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of her family still live in Port Elizabeth, but Belinda intends bringing her mother and five-month-old son Blake to Cape Town as soon as she establishes herself and can afford to buy a house here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To unwind after a strenuous performance, Belinda enjoys cuddling up with a good book, travelling and partying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If she had not been a musician, she says she would have been an accountant &quot;because I like working with money&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - South Africa will lobby European Union member states to review Europe's trade offer, the Department of Trade and Industry's chief foreign trade director Faisel Ismail says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a joint sitting yesterday of Parliament's trade and industry, agriculture and foreign affairs committees, Mr Ismail said suggestions by the European Union (EU) that 40 percent of South Africa's agricultural exports be excluded from a trade deal were seen as &quot;ridiculous and a bit preposterous&quot;, even by some member states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the goods on the list are not even produced in the EU,&quot; Mr Ismail said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the present trade regime, about 90 percent of South Africa's trade with the EU was already duty-free or subject to duties of about one percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is mainly agricultural products on which there are still heavy duties, and this is a relatively small part of South Africa's trade,&quot; Mr Ismail said. &quot;Yet this is the area the EU has sought to exclude.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister of Trade and Industry Alec Erwin had warned the EU negotiators that unless there was progress on this matter, South Africa would &quot;find it hard to proceed with the trade agreement with any enthusiasm&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government also intended to raise the matter at a political level during visits to EU member states later this year, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ismail said the South African negotiators were also arguing that the trade deal should be asymmetrical and that money should be set aside by the EU to help southern African countries over the difficult structural adjustment which would follow on the dismantling of tariff barriers in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He hoped to have an answer on the creation of a structural adjustment fund by July, when Mr Erwin and EU commissioner Joao de Pinheiro would review progress in the trade talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Significant progress had been made in other areas, he said, culminating in approval last month by the EU and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries of South Africa's qualified accession to the Lome Convention.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Former state president F W de Klerk has again vehemently denied that his government approved policies or strategies involving torture, murder or assassination, or that he was aware of illegal security force action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr De Klerk, who faced tough and at times hostile questioning during his day-long testimony to the Truth Commission yesterday as head of the delegation presenting the National Party's second submission, said such policies would have been totally at odds with his Christian beliefs and the political ethos of the NP.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I couldn't live with such decisions. I stand by what I say before you and God: I was not party to such policies there was always an ethos that the law must be upheld, the courts must be upheld and people (transgressing the law) must be prosecuted I reject the imputation that there was this sort of immoral, everything-goes-in-a-state-of-war, the end justifies the means; that was not the philosophy with which I lived, with which I operated, and within which I served.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he admitted that apartheid and the conflict had been &quot;a dark blotch on our history&quot; for which he expressed regret.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also agreed that some of those who should have been the guardians of that ethos - including senior officers in the security forces and even a cabinet minister - had now applied for amnesty for gross human rights abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr De Klerk was questioned by Glenn Goosen, director of the commission's investigative unit, about a State Security Council meeting in May 1986, at which Mr De Klerk was present, where an agenda item on the &quot;Third Force&quot; stated that then defence minister Magnus Malan and law and order minister Louis le Grange had been told to organise &quot;a well-trained capacity to effectively wipe out terrorists&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town -Khayelitsha residents have a better chance of getting to hospital by wheelbarrow than by ambulance, say Cape Town ambulance crews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is because the crisis in the service has stretched resources to the limit, with the result that the injured and sick often have to wait hours for an ambulance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ambulance staff were reacting to the death of Thobeka Madayi in a wheelbarrow in a Khayelitsha street last week - revealed in the Cape Argus - after day hospital staff told her husband, Vuyani Magazi, to arrange his own transport.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A disillusioned group of ambulancemen said the advice given to Mr Magazi by the Nolungile day hospital was based on harsh reality because, on average, only two or three ambulances served Khayelitsha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cape Town municipality, which runs the service on behalf of the province, is seeking a meeting with Health Minister Ebrahim Rasool to discuss the state of the under-resourced service, which has an ageing fleet and a dearth of equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting will also be about who will run the service in future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The service is run on an agency basis, but neither the municipality nor the Cape Metropolitan Council wants to run it, because it has been severely underfunded in the past. They want the province to take it over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambulance chief Greg Pillay said staff were trying to make the best of a bad situation but were &quot;amazingly&quot; able to respond well to public emergencies, such as Saturday's N2 disaster in which 12 people died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ambulance staff said the service was under severe pressure, with fewer than 25 ambulances operating in greater Cape Town at any one time, a control room without computer equipment and more than 30 staff under psychological care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ambulancemen produced job cards showing the time seriously injured patients had had to wait for ambulance transfers from day hospitals in Khayelitsha. Some had spinal injuries, fractured femurs or gunshot wounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one case, a call came in at 10.36am for a patient who had an abdominal injury and was unconscious, but the ambulance was not dispatched until 1.28pm. Ambulances serving Khayelitsha sometimes collected six or seven patients at a time.</SPAN></P>

It is very important that the two meet, and it is really important for Zaire to have a process where there can be a movement towards a government that has been elected, some kind of a peaceful transitional process, and we have to do something about the tragic situation to do with the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a very tough situation. We have obviously tried with the South Africans to bring the two together. We are going to keep all of the international community will be pursuing that because it's essential that they get together and we have some kind of a peaceful transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JIM LEHRER: Is there an agreement of any kind on the part of President Mobutu to step aside?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEC. MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: I think that he is looking for ways to have a transition but I can't go into the details of that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JIM LEHRER: If there--do you think there will be a meeting tomorrow?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEC. MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: We hope so. As I said, we are very disappointed that one did not take place today, and we believe it is essential that the two meet.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Disagreements over a transition plan proposed by South Africa led to cancellation of the Zaire peace talks, which were to have taken place aboard a South African naval vessel off the coast of the Congo on Wednesday. But South African President Nelson Mandela, using his considerable international stature, is persisting in efforts to halt the fight before it spreads to the Zaire capital, Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although security concerns were cited as the reason for the 'no-show' by Laurent Kabila, whose Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire now control over two-thirds of the country, diplomats and other informed sources say it is Kabila's refusal to agree to a South African-proposed transition arrangement that is behind the current stalemate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila arrived in Cape Town today aboard a plane sent by Mandela to bring the Zairean rebel leader from Angola, where he remained yesterday after refusing to meet Mandela and Mobutu Sese Seko, the ailing Zaire president, in Pointe Noire, Congo for talks aboard the South African ship Outeniqua.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa presented a 10-point transition arrangement that would install an interim government with representatives from all the major Zairean political forces. The interim government would administer Zaire for a year and organize democratic elections, which would be the first in the country's history. The plan requires Mobutu to relinquish power immediately, but not directly to Kabila, as the Alliance is insisting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African Broadcasting Corporation, which obtained a copy of the plan, is reporting that Mobutu would be required to step down within 24 hours after the agreement is signed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just before Kabila's arrival in Cape Town, his senior aide, Moise Nyarugabo Muhizi, reiterated that that the Alliance would talk only about a hand-over of power. &quot;Today we give peace talks a last chance,&quot; he told the Associated Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With backing from neighboring Angola, Alliance forces poised outside Kinshasa are thought to be well-equipped for a final push to take the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, the architect of the transition plan, has been having talks with top Mobutu supporters, including a delegation led by Foreign Minister Gerard Kamanda wa Kamanda aboard the ship. Mobutu reportedly returned to Kinshasa last night after a one hour meeting in Pointe Noir with Mandela and Mbeki.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Text of questions and answers by State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns on Zaire at the Department's daily briefing May 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Zaire?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: What's your assessment of what's happening there?  Do you think Kabila has been as cooperative as he could be?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Well, we understand that Mr. Kabila is meeting right now with President Mandela in Capetown. We also understand that President Mobutu has returned to Kinshasa. We understand that the situation in Kinshasa today is rather quiet. The South African Government has gone to enormous lengths to try to put these two people in the same room together. Now they are following a strategy of talking to both of them individually, which is a very good thing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We hope at some point, these two individuals will agree to meet together; or at least agree on a set of rules that would provide the foundation for a transition. We think that transition must be made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Do you have further analysis, though, of the breakdown in the talks yesterday? Of who stood up --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: We think the South African Government provided adequate measures, security measures and others, to set up a meeting. We, frankly, are extremely disappointed that the meeting did not take place. It was no fault of the South African Government. President Mobutu, as you know, was present and ready to meet. So that leaves Mr. Kabila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, he has some concerns about his security; obviously, those are very important concerns. We don't begrudge him that.  But at some point, if he is to be a part of the process of producing a peaceful transition and a peaceful outcome, he needs to sit down with Zairian government officials to work that out. That's what the South African Government is trying to do now, and we support the South African Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Are you dismayed that, given his behavior in the last 24 hours, that he is, as some commentators are suggesting, just bent on a military victory?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Well, we understand that Mr. Kabila promised President Mandela that his troops would stand down, pending further meetings. We hope that's the case. He said that the last time, and the troops continued their military offensive.  So we'll have to judge him by his actions. We don't believe that his troops should move forward into Kinshasa without prior political talks that would decide on how the transition of power that is clearly coming is going to take place; because we think that Mr. Kabila and President Mobutu ought to have, above all, an interest in avoiding bloodshed and protecting the citizens of Zaire from an ongoing civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Is the United States giving any thought to sending another special envoy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I'm not aware of any plans to send a special envoy. We have our ambassador, Ambassador Simpson, in Kinshasa, ambassadors in all of the countries where these events are taking place - Don Steinberg in Angola; Ambassador Joseph in South Africa. So I think we're well represented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Prior to the meeting or the time of the meeting yesterday, Mr. Kabila was meeting with the Angolan president.  The Angolans have clearly had some influence over the rebel alliance. Have there been any conversations between U.S.  officials and President dos Santos about the influence that the Angolans are - or the role that they are apparently playing in whether or not these talks take place? Or what Mr. Kablia --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Yes, we have very strongly encouraged President dos Santos, through Ambassador Steinberg in Rwanda, that the Angolan Government ought to join the efforts of all of us - the South Africans, the United States, France, the United Nations - to bring these parties together. We obviously would not want to see Angola stoke the fires of a civil war and encourage further military movement. We want to see cooperative behavior on the part of Angola with the wider peace efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Have you detected any troop movement by Angola lately?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I really can't speak to that. I just don't have any information on Angolan troop movements. As you know, we have very strongly encouraged Angola and other neighbors of Zaire not to lend arms or troops to the fighting, but unfortunately there has been a great deal of evidence to the contrary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Nick, what role is Howard Wolpe playing and where is he? You said before that there is no plan to send a special envoy. What do you call Howard Wolpe?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: No plans to send - I think where Carol is coming from - may I interpret your question? Are you sending a special envoy from Washington, like Bill Richardson - no plans that I know of to do that. Howard Wolpe is a special presidential emissary. He has been in the region. He was in Lubumbashi two days ago meeting with Mr. Kabila. He is still in the region. I can try to track his movements for you if you are really interested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: And also, I think you or someone told us that Ambassador Richardson had spoken on the telephone with --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Two nights ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Two nights ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: With Mobutu and Kabila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Has he spoken since then?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I don't believe he has, but I can check on that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Nick, as this transition takes place, as you say it inevitably will and must, has the United States taken any accounting of what are thought to be vast sums of money that Mobutu has in his control in various parts of the world? How much is involved? What should be done with such monies? How much of it came out of aid programs that never got to the Zairian people? Is that being worked on at all by the United States?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Well, just to take those questions one at a time, if I could. We are not aware, we in the U.S. Government, that President Mobutu has any substantial, or actually any financial assets here in the United States. He may; he may not. We are just not aware of what his financial holdings may be here. He obviously has sizable off-shore bank accounts. As you know, he has homes in Morocco and in France and in other countries.  Obviously he must have financial holdings overseas. That is the answer to question one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer to question two is that we have seen reports today by the rebel alliance that they are requesting a freezing of President Mobutu's assets overseas. Frankly, we've not been informed by the rebel alliance that they are expecting the United States to take any action in that regard. Perhaps it is directed at other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, we are not aware of any evidence, of any diversion of U.S. assistance to Zaire to Mobutu's personal use. For a long time, for many decades, the United States did supply economic assistance, funds to Zaire. That stopped in the early 1990s, several years ago. We've not been providing Zaire with that kind of assistance. We would be extremely concerned were there any evidence that any of the money sent to Zaire by the United States in the '60s or '70s or '80s had been diverted, but there is no evidence of it. Obviously, that is a pertinent question.  I understand why you are asking it, and we'll continue to keep that in the forefront of our own view here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now as to what should happen on this issue of his financial assets, I think that is an issue for the government of Zaire to work out with the rebel alliance and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: I'm talking about aid money and not other kinds of money like from the CIA for example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: George, I always talk about - George, we're in public here. I'm talking about U.S. economic assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development to Zaire. Of course, I could never comment on actions of the Central Intelligence Agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Not to nit-pick, but before you said money from the United States, and John Stockwell has said that Mobutu stole millions in the '70s of money that was supposed to be earmarked for other purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: George, I can't comment on anything pertaining to intelligence, but I can say that of the very large amount of money extended to the government of Zaire for many decades, through U.S. AID, we're not aware of any kind of diversion of those funds for the personal use of Mobutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, having said all of this, I should say this -- one of the reasons why the United States has been so concerned about Mobutu's stewardship of Zaire is that the country is bankrupt.  It is bankrupt financially. The people of Zaire have not seen the benefits of the economic riches, the mining operations of that country. There is tremendous poverty in the country. A small group of people in and around the Mobutu ruling circle have enriched themselves. There's just no question about that, and no reason to deny it in public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we're dealing with a problem of huge dimensions inside Zaire, and it's partly responsible for the opposition to President Mobutu in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Nick, on the question of the assets, are you saying that you're not aware that Mobutu has any assets in the United States because you just don't know about it, or have you actually done some looking?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Because we just don't know. I don't believe that our Bureau of African Affairs has checked with American banks or investment firms, or whether or not we even have access to that kind of information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Well, is this something that you'd be interested in? I mean, do you feel like you have an obligation to find out if Mobutu has funds in this country?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: At this point, we think it's very important that Mobutu, the government of Zaire, President Mobutu, and the rebel alliance -- they discuss these kinds of issues. This is a transitional issue. It's one of the issues that obviously will be discussed. It's not for the United States to offer public comment on how that issue should be adjudicated between these competing factions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Are you worried that if the United States were to take an aggressive stance on this, that perhaps Mobutu would be less inclined to leave?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: No, I don't believe so. I think it's just our appreciation that the United States cannot delve into every aspect of a country's political crisis as if it's all our business. This is something that he and other Zairian political leaders, including Mr. Kabila, need to work out. This is what they ought to be talking about, in part - all of these different questions. It's not helpful for us to throw rocks from the outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Our story from Geneva suggests that the rebels do want - are asking the United States to freeze whatever assets, if there are assets here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Yes, I saw that same report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: But you haven't gotten some formal request?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I checked with Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Bill Twaddell just before coming out here. He said he's not aware, we are not aware of any request from the rebel alliance. Now, perhaps one will be forthcoming, I don't know.  We'll just deal with that if it does.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Would you honor that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Excuse me?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Would you honor that kind of request?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: We'd have to look at the request and see what it was, but our general orientation, our general view is that the Zairians need to work out these problems. One cannot expect the United States to solve all problems of Zaire. The Zairians need to shoulder responsibility here. Betsy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: I saw one article that says that the amount of debt that Zaire now carries as a country is about $9 billion.  You're saying that this transition is inevitable. Have there been discussions by this building, either with other countries or with international banking institutions, as to what the world response should be to a country that has a debt like that? Will we make any effort to help them deal with this crisis?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Actually, I think it's very difficult for the rest of the world to think of grand schemes to assist Zaire economically in the middle of a civil war and just prior to a fundamental political transition of power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there is a peaceful transition of power, and if the people who come into the government are devoted to stability and economic reform and democracy, if they want to hold elections, I think there would be great sentiment in the United States, in Europe, in Africa to help in the organization of elections. There would be great sentiment to help Zaire get back on its feet. That will all depend on the philosophy of the people who take over after this transition - the economic and political philosophy. We hope it's liberal economically, and democratic politically.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - After more than two hours of talks in Cape Town, Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila agreed to give Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko until Monday to respond to peace proposals put forward by South African President Nelson Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a meeting with reporters, neither leader was willing to provide details. &quot;We are engaged in very sensitive and complicated negotiations and we don't want any party to hear about the discussions we had with the other from the media, as that would complicate matters further,&quot; Mandela said. Kabila said little and refused to state that his troops would ease up on their march towards Kinshasa, the Zaire capital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disagreements over South Africa's draft transition plan led to cancellation of the Zaire peace talks, which were to have taken place aboard a South African naval vessel off the coast of the Congo on Wednesday. But Mandela, using his considerable international stature, persisted in efforts to halt the fight before it spreads to the Zaire capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although security concerns were cited as the reason for the Wednesday 'no-show' by Kabila, whose Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire now control over two- thirds of the country, diplomats and other informed sources say it is Kabila's reluctance to accept the transition arrangement that is behind the current stalemate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila arrived in Cape Town Thursday aboard a plane sent by Mandela to bring the Zairean rebel leader from Angola, where he remained yesterday after refusing to meet Mandela and Mobutu Sese Seko, the ailing Zaire president, in Pointe Noire, Congo for talks aboard the South African ship Outeniqua.</SPAN></P>

The interim government would administer Zaire for a year and organize democratic elections, which would be the first in the country's history. The plan requires Mobutu to relinquish power immediately, but not directly to Kabila, as the Alliance is insisting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With backing from neighboring Angola, Alliance forces poised outside Kinshasa are said to be well-equipped for a final push to take the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking part in the meeting in Cape Town with Mandela and Kabila were Mohammed Sahnoun, the Algerian diplomat who serves as special representative for both the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity, and South AfricaDeputy President Thabo Mbeki, the architect of the transition plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the day, Mbeki held talks aboard the South African ship with a delegation of Mobutu advisors led by Foreign Minister Gerard Kamanda wa Kamanda. Mobutu himself returned to Kinshasa Wednesday night after a one hour meeting in Pointe Noir with Mandela and Mbeki.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbeki remains optimistic in his public statements about the complicated negotiations he has been spearheading for several months. &quot;The talks are not on the verge of collapse,&quot; he said.  &quot;There was a hiccup yesterday.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Namibia's power utility corporation announced yesterday that a well recently drilled at Kudu had confirmed that the present volumes of gas were more than sufficient for an initial development of the Kudu Gas Field to supply a power station with an output of approximately 750 MW over 20 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement yesterday, Shell said the Kudu gas power plant would make Namibia self-sufficient in power during the foreseeable future while also allowing some export of electricity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Further detailed studies and engineering data collection are being initiated together with concurrent discussions and negotiations to secure the market with the intention to reach a final investment decision in 1998,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked to elaborate on the implication of the agreement, NamPower Managing Director Leake Hangala told The Namibian that the move would not in any way affect the disputed Epupa project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the planned Epupa hydro-electric plant would remain an &quot;excellent&quot; venture for Namibia despite the new developments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The agreement will in fact enhance the Epupa project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have seen that there is a market for both the Kudu and Epupa,&quot; the NamPower chief said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hangala said a market for power existed both within and outside Namibia's borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NamPower has agreed to be a partner in the 750 MW gas power plant utilising gas from the Kudu Gas Field &quot;if the technical, economic and financial investigations proved to be favourable&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hangala said a joint study by the parties involved in the project indicated that the proposed power plant could be constructed in the vicinity of Oranjemund as an Independent Power Producer (IPP) with all the three establishments as equity partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A detailed feasibility study to examine the overall aspects of establishing the gas-powered plant, including technical, financial, economic and environmental aspects, is expected to be commissioned soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if it would be possible for the equity partners to raise the funds needed for the power plant to become operational at the beginning of the year 2001, Hangala said he saw nothing that could prevent the corporations from making the needed financial resources available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The companies that will have equity in the project will obviously be able to mobilise the funds,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is envisaged that the development of both the Kudu Gas Fields and the power plant would support the establishment of energy or gas-based industries in Namibia such as mineral beneficiation, petrochemicals and possibly fertilisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Namibian has established that Shell Exploration and Production Namibia are already involved in discussions with South Africa's Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) over the establishment of three multi-million-dollar gas-based plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These include the possibility of an iron plant in the Northern or Western Cape.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - A multi-million shopping complex is to be built at the Katutura Community Centre, it was announced yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complex will be constructed by Super Deca Construction, which has entered into a lease agreement with the Namibia Red Cross Society (NRCS), the owner of the plot on which the centre will be situated.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Work will start on June 10 and during construction 450 Namibians will be employed. The complex will cost N$30 million and is expected to be completed in March next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shops to be housed in the complex include Pep Stores, Big Daddy, Ellerines, Supreme Furnishers, Guys and Girls, Style Clothing, Discom and Pages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among others, it will also include a huge parking area and a taxi rank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a media briefing yesterday NRCS's Secretary General Razia Essack-Kauaria said the centre had identified that the major focus of its drive to become financially self-sufficient &quot;will be the development of our property&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Therefore we called for proposals for this erf as we recognised that the size, location to the Khomasdal and Katutura communities, and potential to bring new economic energy into the community was evident,&quot; said Kauaria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the NRCS will not be substantially enriched, we feel that this is the first step towards self-sustainability. We recognised that we had to enter into certain business ventures to enable us to accomplish our mission,&quot; Kauaria added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NRCS chief said they recognised the historical significance of the centre to residents of Katutura and Khomasdal and had requested the National Monuments Council to preserve two units as a museum for future generations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems fitting that a place that was once known for the suffering of our migrant workers under apartheid can now serve as a viable economic centre for our community,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TSHOLOTSHO, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Nine-year-old Sikhathele Nkomo tumbles helplessly to the ground as the mother tries to hold her up while the father talks to the nursing staff at the clinic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sikhathele is a victim of malaria, which has attacked hundreds of thousands of people in Zimbabwe and killed over 900 this year because of the generally above normal rains last season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The father returns with the medicine and a cup of water and persuades his daughter to swallow the tablets, which she does with a lot of difficulty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mother then carries the feeble girl on her back and walks to their nearby home.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1996, no less than 50 people in Sikhathele's village and neighborhood died of malaria not only because they sought treatment too late, but also because the closest clinic was some 15 km away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She and over 10,000 members of her community are now beneficiaries of the Sikente Ward 10 CAMPFIRE Clinic built with proceeds from the organised sport hunting under the Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (CAMPFIRE) in drought-prone Tsholotsho district, in western Zimbabwe's Matabeleland north province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, the Sikente clinic is an off-shoot of the controversial hunting of the elephant, an issue set to dominate debate at the June meeting of parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in Harare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe, supported by other southern African countries and sympathizers, is going to argue that it has an elephant population that is more than double the number that can be sustainably accommodated by the existing habitat and that the animal can be systematically culled for the benefit of local communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country has between 65,000 and 70,000 elephants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe will therefore be pushing for the down-listing of the elephant from Appendix 1, which prohibits international trade in elephant products, to Appendix 11, which provides for controlled international trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sikente clinic, which is still under construction, has so far cost just over 315,000 Zimdollars (28,636 U.S dollars) and was prematurely opened to the public in February to specifically deal with malaria cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is now manned by three nurses and in February attended to 700 cases of malaria and over 800 cases in March. No malaria deaths have been reported in the area since the beginning of the year, yet health authorities say about 27 people die of the disease each week in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So many lives were lost because of the distance and this year a lot of lives have been saved...So I appeal to you to help us lift the international ban on ivory trade because my community would have benefited more by selling the ivory abroad,&quot; Sikente ward secretary Dennis Nkomo told a group of visiting journalists from Australia and the United Kingdom. &quot;Maybe our clinic would be fully operational by now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sikente clinic is but one of the numerous projects that have been financed by the elephant in Tsholotsho district as some wards have even bought tractors for communal tillage programmes while several boreholes and pumps have also been acquired under CAMPFIRE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most successful ventures in the district is the Ehlekweni campfire project which shares a border with the 14,000 square-kilometer (5,405 square miles) Hwange National Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of proximity to the park, the local community has suffered most from elephant invasions of crop fields but has also benefited significantly from the sport hunting that is co- ordinated by the Rural District Council and the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides constructing a 50-km (31 miles) road from Rubizi to Pelandaba, to join the main road to Bulawayo, the Ehlekweni people have built a community hall, also used as a church, a general dealer's shop, a community guest house and water and toilet facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The general dealer's shop ensures agricultural inputs and other basic groceries are within reach of the community, which lives in a remote area on the border with Botswana, about 300 km north-west of Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CAMPFIRE project was launched in Tsholotsho district in 1989 and eight of the 20 wards participate in the programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the programme, of the revenue raised from sport hunting, of mainly elephant, 60 percent goes to the ward in which the animal would have been shot and it is the community which decides how to spend the money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rural District Council takes 20 percent as administration fee while the other 20 percent also goes to council as management fee which is eventually ploughed back into the wards through development projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council said as of April, it had raised some 5.5 million Zimdollars (495,406 U.S. dollars). While the council raised about 12,000 Zimdollars(1,090 U.S. dollars) from each elephant when the project started, each elephant head now cost 85,000 Zimdollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The revenue from the sport hunting which, as you can see, has made a lot of difference in the quality of life of people in the district could have been much higher had there been international trade since all the tusks and skins are taken by the department of national parks and are losing quality with each passing day, Kembo Tshuma, the district CAMPFIRE manager, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe is said to have lost an estimated 320 million Zimdollars (29.1 million U.S. dollars) in potential revenue since the ban in international ivory trade started in 1989. The country has over 29 tons of ivory in its stocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Zimbabwe may have justification for lifting the ban, some Western animal rights groups insist such a move would lead to increased poaching that would eventually wipe out the world's remaining elephant population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe Hwange national park warden Senanelo Moyo aptly summed it all up when he said: &quot;It is those who keep their dogs and cats holed up in high rise apartments in New York and London and have never lived with wild animals who make the most noise.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - With the rebel attack on Kinshasa seemingly imminent, African newspapers have again focused on the country and the reluctance of its president, Mobutu Sese Seko, to leave office immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka-based Daily Post said, early this week, that the two- track negotiations by the United States and South African on Zaire's civil rule &quot;may come unstuck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That prediction became fact Wednesday: Zaire's Number One &quot;rebel,&quot; Laurent Kabila, failed to meet Mobutu and South African President Nelson Mandela on board a naval ship for a second round of negotiations on Mobutu's immediate political departure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Post noted that the negotiators had &quot;as their professed primary aim&quot; the prevention of a further bloodbath in Zaire. At the same time, it added, the negotiators appeared anxious to find a dignified exit for Mobutu.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the two approaches are turning out to be mutually exclusive and now threaten to render the negotiators' painstaking efforts useless,&quot; It said. &quot;The more they attempt to accommodate President Mobutu, the more determined Laurent Kabila and his Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo become to remove the ailing dictator by force,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why a dignified exist for Mobutu?&quot; The Monitor, published in Addis Ababa, asked. &quot;A dignified exit for a robber baron -- that's what the current call by the West for a dignified exist for Mobutu amounts to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as with Ethiopia six years ago when rebels threatened to storm Addis Ababa, The Monitor said, with Zaire &quot;concern mounts in Western capitals for a dignified exist&quot; of Mobutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abidjan's Le Jour also pondered over the neat exit being prepared for Mobutu since, it said, for cash strapped Kinshasa residents, the country's money &quot;has been stolen and the social infrastructure (made) non-existent because Mobutu has only taken care of his relatives,&quot; to the detriment of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For its part, Sud Quotidien, published in Dakar, concerned itself with parliament's appointment of Archbishop Laurent Mosengwo as Zaire's interim head of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mosengwo's comeback is a new indication of the disarray within the political class in Kinshasa, but which does not affect Marshall Mobutu,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that Mobutu seems to be &quot;a spent force,&quot; it said, &quot;has not stripped him of his capacity for maneuvering.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By allowing Mosengwo's return to the fore of Zaire's polity, it said, &quot;Mobutu is presenting his usual game plan: using men like pawns in a chess game, and putting his personal touch to it by politically killing and resurrecting them to perpetuate his own reign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It advised Mosengwo to take the job only after serious thought, because like Tshisekedi, &quot;used as a pawn&quot; in a game he could not master, Mosengwo risked &quot;being burnt at the stakes of Kinshasa's Byzantine politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said that Mosengwo would likely suffer this fate &quot;without being able to change anything&quot; of the resolve by the anti-Mobutu alliance to seize power. The result, it said, would be that Mosengwo would &quot;end up complicating a situation which could be wisely simplified.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi's Standard sees in Mobutu &quot;a daring Man in spite of himself.&quot; It said: &quot;Many African leaders in his position would have scampered into exile at the first signs of trouble. But Mobutu is taking his time in what is either dogged intransigence or a gamble with fate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It continued, &quot;Why does Mobutu postpone his exit? The signs of the apocalypse are clear enough, except perhaps, only to Mobutu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper suggests that the man probably wants to prove a point: &quot;that although he might have experienced military losses, with a knock-knee and thieving army that excels more in looting than defending the country, personally, he is not a coward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the reason, and although Mobutu is known for his survival mien, it said, &quot;this time the noose is tightening around his neck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sooner or later, it continued, &quot;he will have to do what many dictators before him have done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu, it added, &quot;could be the proverbial cock which leaves no hen untouched, but this time the head-cock will know there are other cocks in the neighborhood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kampala's New Vision advised these other cocks, Africa's new or emerging leaders, to resist self-aggrandizement typified by Mobutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Africa's new leadership should ensure that situations that militate against democracy, causing leaders to flee to exile, are eradicated. They would also do well to put in place conditions that guarantee the smooth transfer of power,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to support a new breed of leaders who are prepared to champion democracy, and put in place political changes that ensure transparency and accountability,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today,&quot; it went on, &quot;all African people should make decisions of who should lead them if they are to resist the tragedies of dictatorship. Regimes like the collapsing Mobutu kleptocracy cannot fit in the new picture of a democratic Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Zaire's war reaches a crescendo Liberia's appears on the verge of ending with the comparative whimper of national elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, the decision by West African leaders to reinforce their peace monitoring force in Liberia to 13,000 men was, to Sud Quotidien, a confirmation of the leaders' &quot;new commitment to the complete resolution&quot; of that crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Formerly, this consensus was missing, it said, because the conflicting interests of Francophone and Anglophone countries &quot;had always hindered the various attempts at a peaceful settlement&quot; of the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, it said &quot;what matters today is the common will of Ecowas (the Economic Community of West African States) to put Liberia on the path of peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the troops reinforcement, which now includes a few more French-speaking states, is designed to do just that by guaranteeing peaceful elections after seven years of war.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - Some 50,000 out of 135,000 Togolese refugees in Ghana have voluntarily returned home under a repatriation programme being implemented by the International Organisation of Migration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another 3,465 of the remainder have registered to return home voluntarily, Ghana's interior minister, Nii Okaija Adamafio, said Thursday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was opening the third Quadripartite Meeting on the Voluntary Repatriation of Togolese Refugees in Accra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adamafio said the decision to grant asylum to refugees from Togo and Liberia was difficult, bearing in mind the social and economic costs to Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We, however, accepted them in the true spirit of African solidarity and brotherliness,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the government will continue to do all in its power to ensure the safety and welfare of the refugees, but would &quot;definitely not tolerate any acts of criminality on their part.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The representative in Ghana for the U.N.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUBUMBASHI, Zaire (PANA) - The man poised to enter Kinshasa as a hero, to many, is Laurent Kabila, whose forces have forced President Mobutu Sese Seko into exile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila reappeared forcefully onto the Zairean political scene in October 1996, after living a somewhat quiet life in the country's political backwaters for almost three decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila was born 63 years ago in the town of Ankoro on the banks of the Congo River in North Katanga, now Shaba Province. He is of the Luba ethnic group located in Zaire's Kasai Oriental Province.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He studied philosophy in France and later became a member of the Assembly of North Katanga. As a young Marxist-Maoist revolutionary during the heady days of communist power, Kabila drew his political inspiration from his idol, the late Congolese (now Zaire) prime minister, Patrice Lummumba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila's adoption of communism led to collision with the post- independence capitalist forces in Zaire, whose nominal leader was Zaire's first president, Joseph Kasavubu. Kasavubu was then supported by Joseph Mobutu, then a prominent voice as a colonel in the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Lumumba was murdered by his enemies, led by Moise Tshombe, Kabila joined forces with the National Liberation Council of the Congo, a rebel movement inspired by Lumumba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April 1964 Kabila with Gaston Soumialot, another revolutionary, launched the &quot;Simba&quot; rebellion in the Rusizi area near the town of Uvira, which they captured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, lack of motivation, treachery and dissension within the ranks of the movement led to the collapse of the group. It was no match for the Zairean government military offensive launched with the help of the United States and Belgium. It was U.S. Airforce planes that flew Belgian paratroopers to Stanleyville (now Kisangani) to support Mobutu to save Zaire from &quot;Communism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a fierce onslaught by the government, Kabila and his rebels fled in 1964. In November 1965, Mobutu now a general declared himself president after a coup. Mobutu an ethnic Ngbandi from Equator Province became a staunch supporter of the West during the Cold War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila and Soumialot countered Mobutu by forming the People's Revolutionary Party (PRP) in October 1967. The party had an armed wing called the People's Armed Forces, a rebel group based at Fizi in the Baraka Mountains near Lake Tanganyika.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila believed in radical revolutions to achieve his aims rather than round table discussions. At one time, he fought alongside the legendary Che Guevara. Critics have called Kabila the longtime opposition leader to Mobutu. Kabila is now arguably the doyen of African rebel leaders. His recent rebellion has been the swiftest and most successful uprising in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (Zaire) is well organised, motivated and has displayed tactical precision, even when pitted against European mercenaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alliance is a combination of local forces and, recently, deserting soldiers from the demoralized and hopeless government soldiers. But the core of the alliance includes Kabila's resurrected PRP which still retains Marxist strategies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has a large number of Zairean Tutsi called the Banyamulenge from the Alliance Democratique Des Peuple, whose leader is Deogratias Bugera from Rutshuru. The group also includes the Banyamasisi who were chased from their homes by Mobutu's government administrators in North and South Kivu Provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other member of the alliance is the Mouvement Revolutionnaire Pour la Liberation du Zaire whose leader is Masusu Nindaga. The party is mainly supported by the Bashi ethnic group found around Bukavu and South Kivu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there is also the Conseil National de Resistance Pour la Democracie with rebel leaders from eastern kasai. The rebel party was previously led by the late Andrei Kisase Nandu, a Luba who was Kabila's second in command. The rebel group also included the Mouvement d'Action Pour La Renaissance de Kongo, headed by Daniel Monguya. He is a politician from Bandundu Province, near Kinshasa, now living in exile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila has won recognition and respect internationally for his declared mission to return order, peace and development to Zaire, arguably Africa's most maligned and mismanaged country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has given an indication of how he hopes to achieve this by reviving public institutions in the areas occupied by the Alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabilla's revolution hopes to reverse thee decades of rot incarnated by Marshall Mobutu Sese Seko's dictatorship in Zaire, African's third largest state and one of the world richest countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, who is serving his second and last five-year term of office, has said that he will not groom a successor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Time will tell who succeeds me but certainly ten years in office is enough and I have to step aside for someone to bring in new ideas,&quot; he said Thursday in an interview Thursday on Zambia television.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba also threatened to sack any of his ministers or party members of his Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) who are said to be already campaigning for the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that it would be folly for members of the party to preoccupy themselves with the presidential campaigns so early at the expense of the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When time comes we (MMD) will have show what we have done for the people. Those ministers and party national committee members found campaigning directly or by proxy will have to leave and I will appoint others to do the work,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been reports of clandestine campaigns by some ministers and party officials for the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finance Minister Ronald Penza, who is among Chiluba's ministers said to be involved in the campaigns, came out in the open last week and denied involvement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA, Uganda (PANA) - Uganda, which is suspected to be aiding rebels seeking to overthrow Zaire's president Mobutu Sese Seko, has shifted its embassy from Kinshasa to Brazzaville in neighbouring Congo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was revealed on Friday by the government-owned Ugandan daily, New Vision, which quoted the country's Minister for Foreign Affairs in-charge of Regional Cooperation, Rebecca Kadaga, as saying the move was aimed at protecting the mission's staff.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister of state said the mission was transferred to the Congolese capital last month due to an impending attack on Kinshasa by Laurent Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said, however, that only the Ambassador, Kamanda Bataringaya and his deputy would operate from Brazzaville while the other members of staff have been recalled to Kampala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kadaga said the embassy would move back to Kinshasa when the dust settles in the Zairean capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ADFL has threatened to storm the city if the ailing Mobutu, who has ruled the country for more than three decades, refuses to relinquish power by Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past seven months since the war erupted in eastern Zaire, authorities in Kinshasa have repeatedly accused Rwanda and Uganda and, at a certain moment, Burundi, of fighting alongside or giving logistical support to the ADFL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three countries have refuted the allegation, saying they have their own internal problems to deal with and did not have the resources for fighting other people's wars.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The greatness of a nation consists not so much in the extent of its territory but in the extent and justice of its compassion - inscription on the famous horse memorial in Port Elizabeth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Friday, readers were shocked by a photograph on the front page of this newspaper of a heartbroken husband standing next to a rusty wheelbarrow containing the body of his wife who had died while he was desperately trying to get someone to help him get her to hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, we publish an account of a baby who died of gastro enteritis and pneumonia - both preventable and treatable diseases - in a taxi on the way to hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Budgets have been cut and depleted staffs of hospitals and clinics and are operating under stressful circumstances.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The once highly acclaimed Peninsula ambulance service is so stretched that disillusioned crews said this week it probably would be quicker to get to hospital from Khayelitsha in a wheelbarrow - or a taxi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, the primary health care system is breaking down so badly that people are dying on the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These problems need to be addressed urgently but there appears to be another disquieting thread running through reports reaching our offices in recent months from people forced to rely on the public health system: it seems as if compassion has been forgotten in the chaos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provincial health minister Ebrahim Rasool had some hard things to say this week about unprofessional attitudes at day hospitals and called for resolve to make the city's health system a decent, caring one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shame on you Cape Town. When and why did you cease to care?  Remember, it matters not whether a city is part of a great democracy with the most enlightened constitution in the world; nor whether its name goes up in lights as the most desirable holiday destination on earth; nor whether it hosts the most successful Olympic Games in history; it all counts for nothing if it has lost its soul.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Luhlaza Secondary School, the trouble has been triggered by a fist-fight between two male teachers in front of pupils.  At Masiyile High School, the problem centres around delays in dividing the overcrowded school into three schools.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been no teachers at Luhlaza since Friday last week. Trouble began a few weeks ago when the Western Cape Education Department ordered a probe into the fight. It was recommended that one of the teachers be suspended pending the outcome of the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But pupils were angered by the plan to suspend the man, claiming he was a &quot;good teacher&quot;, and instead demanded that the principal leave. Last week they toyi-toyied in support of the teacher facing suspension and called on the other teacher involved in the fight to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crisis culminated in school staff being held hostage by pupils on Thursday last week. They were rescued by police later in the day. Teachers are now said to be too scared to return to the school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luhlaza is a township school renowned for its stability and good results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Masiyile, chaos has erupted after teachers, parents and students accused the department of &quot;dragging its feet&quot; in dividing the over-populated school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week teachers staged a sit-in in the staff room, washed their cars and sunned themselves while pupils walked up and down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The school has 4 000 pupils, 36 classes and 94 teachers.  Teachers said each classroom had between 90 and 120 pupils. At a press conference at the school yesterday, the Parents', Teachers' and Students' Association (PTSA) said the department had agreed to divide the school into three, with some pupils to be transferred to schools in Maitland and District Six.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department promised that the transfers would start on May 1, but failed to meet the deadline. &quot;The department is now reneging on the agreement at the expense of our children,&quot; the PTSA said. The department could not be reached for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PTSA last week marched to the offices of provincial Premier Hernus Kriel and Education Minister Martha Olckers to submit memoranda, giving Monday this week as a deadline to attend to the problem. There has been no reply, so teachers have embarked on an indefinite sit-in and are threatening to march to the office of national Minister of Education Sibusiso Bengu next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Masiyile is renowned for its choir. In 1995 it was invited by the Japanese government to represent South Africa at a music festival commemorating the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until recently the school was one of the most stable in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problems began with overcrowding, and last year a row erupted when the principal fled after angry pupils accused her of witchcraft. The principal took a voluntary severance package at the end of last year.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - If a chaotic desk is a sign of a great mind at work, then Lungile Jacobs, director of the UCT Choir for Africa, must be a genius.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sitting behind piles of papers from which it seems all semblance of order has been deliberately removed, the amiable Lungile talks about the African tradition of music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's laid back, relaxed on the eve of conducting three works in the 1997 Caltex-Cape Argus massed choir festival at the Good Hope Centre on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from being a talented baritone himself and both conductor and composer of choral works, Jacobs occupies a full- time post as schools liaison officer in the development and public affairs office at the University of Cape Town.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A young man (he is about to turn 29) he looks just like a student himself, dressed as he is in a peaked cap (back to front) jeans and slops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I try not to look like the teachers as much as possible, because once students start associating you with teachers they feel less free to talk to you,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacobs advises students about post-matriculation studies and studying at UCT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To us, music is not something that you learn at school.  Every activity that we do has music ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When a child is born the birth is celebrated with music, as with the reaching of manhood, obtaining work and marriage too.  Every ceremony is accompanied by music and the music differs for each. And the essence of African music is that no two performances can be the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turning to Lungile's career, which comes first - the PR work or the music?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's a very good question ... unfortunately, there isn't an opportunity for me to become a full-time musician in this country, especially with my first love being choral music.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born in Port Elizabeth and educated first in the Eastern Cape and later at UCT's College of Music, Lungile made his debut with the CTSO in 1990, singing Non Piu Andrai from The Marriage of Figaro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His father was a jazz saxophonist and his mother a singer in her youth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh and my uncle ... when I left PE I spent two years with my uncle who was a choral director and I think that was where most of the influence came from, because he would ask me to transcribe a lot of music.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, in fact, a career in music was the furthest thing from the young Lungile's mind when he was growing up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From Standard 5 I only wanted to become a pharmacist. The problem with growing up in the '80s is that we never had career guidance in our schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because I admired the only black person in PE who was a pharmacist and had a chemist in the township, he was my role model and that was all I knew I wanted to be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, when in Standard 9, Lungile developed a keen interest in medical technology. But fate drew him inexorably towards his real talents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Standard 2 he had loved singing and was a member of the school choir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From about Standard 9, I knew how to write the tonic sol-fa (scale) and I would always be scribbling things but I didn't know how to put it together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When my class teacher saw this she said, 'Why don't you follow a career in music?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacobs, who had never given music a thought, was discouraged by not having had any formal musical education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I told my folks about it, my mum was not impressed!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She continued to discourage him until he began to win prizes in competitions with his obvious talent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He spent six months at the University of Fort Hare &quot;just learning about music&quot; and picking up the basics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only in 1989, when he majored in singing, did he also start to play an instrument - the piano - for the first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this point in our interview, he gets an urgent call from a Khayelitsha school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The students are on strike and since Lungile has previously ran an SRC workshop with them, they want him to come post-haste and mediate in a crisis with the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in Xhosa, he assures them he will be there as soon as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Music. Choir directing. Composing. A full-time PR job and now mediating in school crises! How on earth does he get the time?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have no idea how full my schedule is! I normally leave the office at six and have a rehearsal at seven which lasts until about nine or 10. Then when I get home I still have to cook!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacobs tells me that unfortunately there is no choral school in the country so he has to buy books and teach himself about choral directing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This country has got what is probably the richest choral singing in the world but there is no choral school!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What music does he listen to when at leisure?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I listen a lot and my taste varies from Ladysmith Black Mambazo to Beethoven's string quartets. It depends on the mood.  But when I want to be at peace with myself, I put on choral music because there's no instrument better than the voice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interview ends with Lungile Jacobs treating me to a snatch of the Humming Chorus from Madam Butterfly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 16, the UCT Choir for Africa will leave on a tour of Norway.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Controversial former Crossroads &quot;mayor&quot; Johnson Ngxobongwana is one of four people subpoenaed by the Truth Commission to answer questions about events in KTC and other Peninsula informal settlements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A &quot;Section 29&quot; subpoena was served this week on Mr Ngxobongwana, who is a National Party MP in the Western Cape legislature, and he is due to appear before the commission's investigative unit on May 29.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another Peninsula squatter leader, Prince Gobingca, who stood as an election candidate in 1994 as a member of former Ciskei military ruler Brigadier Oupa Gqozo's African Democratic Movement, was also subpoenaed and is due to appear on May 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior Superintendent William Rudolf Liebenberg, a former head of the police's Western Cape &quot;terrorism detection unit&quot;, has been subpoenaed for June 3, and former police colonel Trevor Vermeulen is due to appear on June 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their testimony, which will relate mainly to events in these areas during the mid-to-late 1980s, will take place behind closed doors, ahead of the public &quot;special event&quot; hearing starting on June 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This hearing will focus on events such as the the orgy of violence which engulfed Crossroads, KTC and satellite settlements in May and June 1986, when &quot;Witdoek&quot; vigilante groups, allegedly loyal to such conservative leaders as Mr Ngxobongwana and supported by the police, went on the rampage and destroyed hundreds of shacks, leaving an estimated 70 people dead and 70 000 homeless.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The Truth Commission is determined to establish whether assassinated Swapo lawyer Anton Lubowski was a paid spy of the South African government, as alleged by former Defence Minister Magnus Malan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Lubowski's family and friends have rejected the sensational claim, first made by General Malan in parliament in 1989 and repeated during his testimony to the commission last week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His sister wrote an impassioned letter to a Cape Town newspaper after General Malan's testimony, accusing the Truth Commission of not doing enough to discover the truth about her brother's murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission deputy-chairman Alex Boraine yesterday said he was saddened by the letter and that several of the commissioners, including himself, had spent &quot;very considerable time&quot; on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said commission investigators would examine the documents - alleged receipts - on which General Malan had based his claim and which were now in the archives of the Harms Commission. The Truth Commission would also talk to Judge Louis Harms to see whether he could shed any light on the matter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The domestic footwear industry could disappear if it is not given more time to restructure, says Sid Finlayson, managing director of Bolton Footwear in Great Brak River.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bolton Footwear produces men's and ladies' branded shoes - Watson, Bally, Young Klinik, Patrick, Paolo Falcone, Lemaitre, Step-on-Air and Hang Ten - aimed mostly at the middle to upper end of the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also owns three Mercedes Benz dealerships in Knysna, George and Oudtshoorn.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week the company, a subsidiary of Bolton Industrial Holdings which also controls Cargo Carriers, reported a 14 percent fall in net profits to R4,9 million for the year to February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The blame for the industry's woes has been placed squarely on imports from countries which are not members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From almost nothing six years ago, imports from these countries have grown to about 42 million pairs of shoes a year - almost all from China,&quot; Mr Finlayson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This compares to an annual domestic consumption of about 100 million pairs of shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Finlayson said the Department of Trade and Industry's proposed restrictions on imports of footwear from non-WTO countries were laudable and would help stabilise the industry, but needed to go further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The restrictions, which have still to be applied, will limit imports of shoes from non-WTO countries to 15 million pairs a year - a figure which will be reviewed every year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Finlayson said this would show immediate benefits at the lower-priced end of the market - the area targeted by present imports, and an area which Bolton Footwear has avoided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the company had seen competition coming and had focused on the middle to upper sectors of the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But you can't restructure the industry on a 12-month promise - it will take at least five years to restructure,&quot; Mr Finlayson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The restructuring included upgrading technology, work re- organisation, and training and retraining of workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said about 15 000 jobs had been lost throughout the industry - in tanning, material suppliers and footwear manufacture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our company has shed about 120 jobs since the middle of last year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Finlayson said footwear production in South Africa had shrunk to the extent that it was only just capable of maintaining the structure of related support businesses, the tanning industry and material suppliers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If those people disappear - we will disappear with them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He must also make arrangements to have the decision gazetted as soon as possible and notify the Department of Correctional Services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of the 10 prisoners, the gazetted notices had not been placed immediately, Archbishop Tutu said. &quot;There was a lot of to-ing and fro-ing, but that is not satisfactory. We ought to have found a way,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - An emotional Archbishop Desmond Tutu described National Party leader F W de Klerk's testimony to the Truth Commission this week as &quot;very deeply distressing&quot; and &quot;devastating&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he could not understand how the former state president could claim not to have known about security force abuses because he (Archbishop Tutu) had been among those who had told Mr De Klerk at the time that such abuses had occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archbishop Tutu, choking back tears, told a media conference after a day-long meeting of the full Truth Commission that the NP apartheid policies had brought about suffering and had led to people being killed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have to accept that. The policy may not have said that (kill), but when you say 'Wis hulle uit' (eliminate them) and 'It is a war situation', it's odd you should say you didn't intend you should kill people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was supported by his deputy, Alex Boraine, who said the NP had to accept responsibility for policies &quot;which, in our view, would inevitably lead to atrocities&quot;. The state of emergency legislation was &quot;nothing less than a licence to kill&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archbishop Tutu acknowledged that Mr De Klerk had made &quot;a very impassioned, handsome apology&quot; for apartheid, but said that the NP leader had then negated this with some of his other remarks, such as dismissing claims of torture by prisoners as African National Congress propaganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archbishop Tutu sad he had visited survivors of a massacre in Sebokeng. They had told him from their hospital beds how white men, who had blackened their hands but not their arms, had attacked them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These (survivors) were not smart, politically wise people.  I went to De Klerk and told him, and they said we were vilifying the police.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survivors of the Boipatong massacre had told him how the police had escorted their attackers and had shone spotlights for them so that they could see the houses they were attacking, Archbishop Tutu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And we went and told them, and he (De Klerk) tells me he didn't know. I'm sad.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The Truth Commission's work has been plunged into crisis by a National Party threat to ask the High Court to force the commission and its most prominent members - including chairman Archbishop Desmond Tutu - to show impartiality and fairness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An angry NP statement has accused the commission of being &quot;a travesty of what was intended by the TRC process&quot; and of &quot;misrepresenting&quot; evidence given this week by NP leader F W de Klerk in his second submission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NP outburst follows an emotional speech by Archbishop Tutu yesterday in which he said he had been brought close to tears by his disappointment with Mr De Klerk's second submission, and statements by TRC deputy chairman Alex Boraine that the NP must accept political accountability for policies that would inevitably lead to atrocities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you look at the legislation during the state of emergency, it was a licence to kill,&quot; Dr Boraine said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, NP justice spokeswoman Sheila Camerer said the party was seeking legal advice on what the commissioners had said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: &quot;The NP believes it has no option but to apply to court to force the commission to comply with the TRC Act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the Act required all commissioners to be impartial and without political bias and to make findings only after hearing all the evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tutu and Boraine are not even attempting to be impartial and are clearly showing their prejudice by making these premature statements, pre-empting any findings by the TRC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is unbelievable that they are still awaiting certain further evidence and replies from Mr De Klerk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Camerer described the criticism of Mr De Klerk's submission as &quot;a travesty of what was intended by the TRC process&quot; and accused Archbishop Tutu and Dr Boraine of having misrepresented what the NP leader had said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Mr De Klerk had made it clear that he did not, and had never, denied knowledge of apartheid-era atrocities by security forces, but had said such acts were not authorised by the NP and that he had ordered investigations when wrongdoing had been brought to his notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have, without explanation or reason, merely rejected Mr De Klerk's earnest apology,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night the NP said it was shocked by yesterday's comments by the TRC commissioners and said that &quot;it is clear the whole process of reconciliation is now experiencing its deepest crisis thus far.&quot; The party was not willing to allow the reconciliation process to carry on &quot;in this manner&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday the NP also accused the TRC of &quot;unfair judicial procedure&quot; in its cross-examination of Mr De Klerk and alleged that the harsh treatment given to him contrasted with the &quot;comradely manner&quot; in which Deputy-President Thabo Mbeki and other ANC leaders had been questioned during their second submission this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Camerer accused commissioner Glen Goosen of &quot;overstepping the mark in his rigorous cross-examination&quot; of Mr De Klerk. &quot;His tactics in handing a 58-page bundle of documents to Mr De Klerk and demanding immediate responses to it does not remotely respect the ethos of our judicial system and clearly ignores accepted judicial process - which demands that documentation be made available to witnesses well before a hearing at which they may be asked questions about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A judge would have reprimanded Advocate Goosen for this unfair procedure and would have barred the document. To his credit, TRC chairperson Archbishop Tutu disallowed further questioning on the documents once the NP objected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Mr Goosen's actions &quot;will do nothing to counter the growing suspicion amongst the public at large that the TRC is anything but even-handed and impartial&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Mr De Klerk's evidence this week, Archbishop Tutu said he found it &quot;difficult to understand&quot; the NP leader's assertion that he did not know about the havoc being wrought by the security forces.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The women played some strokes of genius but there were not many spectactors to witness them</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAST week's South African women's amateur golf championships at Killarney Golf Club highlighted two factors: this country possesses rely lade of grass out of place. women golfers of a high quality but the sport still struggles to attract the galleries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immaculate Killarney in Johannesburg could not have provided a better autumnal setting for the Bell's national strokeplay and matchplay championships. The par-72 parkland layout was superbly manicured with s van Wyk, a few parents of other competing players, an official or Four</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first three days featured the strokeplay championships and Free State's Sanet Marais, the country's number one women's amateur, prevailed after rounds of 71, 75 and 69.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Level with Clovelly's Wendy Warrington on 146 going into the final round, the diminutive one-handicapper clinched the title in style.  birdies over the closing nine holes gave Marais her second national strokeplay title - after her strokeplay/matchplay double in 1994 - and a 54-hole aggregate of 215.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marais' performance over the three days exuded class, but she only drew &quot;crowds&quot; of her boyfriend and former Western Transvaal cricketer mparison with the men's game; insufficient publicity was generated for two, the odd genuine golfing spectator and three members of the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reasons for this poor attendance could be one or more of several: nowadays, the Gauteng sporting public face a surfeit of international and top provincial attractions; women's golf pales as a spectacle in keplay event were a lot more compelling for that rarity - the Generally, the Killarney championships; there were no real drawcards taking part in the event. This list could go on and you can take your pick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the fact remains that, while women amateurs do not strike the ball as far as their male counterparts, they still produce golf of a high and eminently watchable calibre.  women amateurs swing straight and sweetly smooth. They are well-equipped to play the percentage game and they hit a large number of fairways and greens. Many display a Seve Ballesteros- like touch with seven iron, wedge and putter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women's matchplay championships which immediately followed the let Vijoen while Warrington three- putted the last for Free nsington's Killarney spectator - in that they served up an enticing casserole of high drama, upsets and quality play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the drama and upsets: both Marais and Warrington, the expected finalists in the event, were knocked out in the quarter- finals. Marais narrowly lost on the 20th hole to KwaZulu-Natal's talented 16-year- old State's Yolande Pelser to steal a slender one-hole victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The matchplay title was finally won over 36 holes by Benoni Country Club's Joanne Norton - a golfer who had previously rated herself as a better strokeplayer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 24-year-old Norton clinched victory six and five over ird nine of 34. Moulder, a long hitter of the ball and a magician around Cherry Moulder, having established a solid foothold for her triumph after opening up a massive nine- hole lead in the morning. Twice Norton holed approach shots to card a splendid two-under-par 70.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stubbornly, though, the 20-year-old Moulder refused to lie down and she clawed back three holes in the early part of the afternoon with a lly a reasonable gallery of around 80 watched the golfing story unfold the greens, chipped in from 15m for birdie on the third and all but drove the 256m eighth to pick up another hole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Norton's considerable lead from the morning 18 proved too stiff a task for Moulder to overhaul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one-handicapper went seven holes up after Moulder three- putted the 10th and, despite a Moulder win on the 14th after getting up and down from a greenside bunker, both players shared the next two holes. That presented the Benoni player with her inaugural title on the 31st hole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One other point worth mentioning about the matchplay final was that at it is in the Transvaal, in particular, that doesn't bring out the - but that is the exception rather than the norm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How can this general lack of spectator support for women's golf be overcome? Wendy Warrington, South Africa's 1985 and 1986 women's amateur matchplay champion, is undecided: &quot;It's very difficult and I don't know at the moment and the plus-two handicapper is generally the &quot;I &quot;The The people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We got the coverage for the nationals at Killarney and, if we can keep that up, it can only help. But I believe it's the local golfers that need to come out more - so maybe more posters are required in the clubs, in the ladies' locker-rooms things like that.&quot; whole scenario can resemble the chicken-and-egg sequence, especially with regard to bringing more players into the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The women's amateur players now are definitely younger than, say, 10 years ago,&quot; Warrington says. &quot;But there are not enough coming through and that can only be drummed up by a lot more overall media coverage, sponsorship and advertising in women's golf.&quot; biggest problem we've got at the moment is the younger players turning pro and that keeps taking it out of amateur golf. The minute anybody gets good, they turn pro and we lose them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However Gilly Tebbutt, five-time winner of the matchplay title between 1984 and 1995 and strokeplay champion in 1986, 1989 and 1990 (shared), is a little more optimistic.  think now it's going from strength to strength. We've got a lot of very good young players coming up - as we saw in the matchplay final - and Colet Viljoen from Natal is a very good prospect. It will take a couple of years as they're all fairly inexperienced but it all bodes very well for the next five to 10 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanet Marais represents the flagship of women's amateur golf in South leading drawcard at most local events</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How good is this diminutive player - affectionately known as &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; by her peers - and how good can she become?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sanet has played a lot of international golf, so she has the experience,&quot; says Tebbutt. &quot;I think she's an extremely good golfer - time.&quot; she's got an excellent temperament and her concentration is impressive. She's still young and yet she's already achieved an enormous amount at the age of 24. I think she can only get better. You know, golfers reaches their prime in their mid- thirties so I think she's going to have a lot of good golf - and her experience will really count in 10 rsion of the South African women's game can emulate Marais - and travel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as Tebbutt is concerned, Marais's real strengths lie in her mental attitude and her short game: &quot;Her mental attitude is very strong, her short game is very good, she's a very consistent player and she strikes the ball very well. She can only go far.&quot; Hopefully, the amateur Stewart raves over Rubens masterpiece equally far.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The soccer programme this weekend is nothing if not varied with two Zimbabwe clubs in South Africa, Aces staging a home match several hundred kilometres from their Witbank base, and some strange kick-off times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday afternoon, Harare Glamour Boys Dynamos are at PAM Brink Stadium in Springs to face Jomo Cosmos in the second leg of a delicately balanced African Cup-winners Cup second- round tie. Dynamos, easily the most popular and successful Zimbabwe soccer club, triumphed 2-1 at home after makeshift striker Hilton Jordaan had given the Ezenkosi a second-minute lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosmos, on their day a match for any South African club, surprisingly reached the semi-finals when they previously appeared in the competition four years ago and have at least an even chance of eliminating Dynamos. Coach Jomo Sono, who also owns a club where the emphasis tilts heavily towards youth, will not know until the last minute whether free-scoring Mozambicans Manuel &quot;Tico Tico&quot; Bucuane and Nuro Tualibudne are fit to play.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dynamos, four-time African Champions Cup quarter-finalists, have a mixed away record, losing 1-0 to Sigara of Tanzania in the preliminary round and defeating Bata Bullets of Malawi by the same score in the first-round proper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While this tie could swing either way, Orlando Pirates will have only themselves to blame should they fail to overcome CAPS United and reach the lucrative mini-league phase of the Champions League. CAPS slammed five goals past Ugandan outfit Express at home in the initial round, making Pirates' 2-1 victory at the National Stadium in the Zimbabwean capital all the more creditable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victory may have had an element of luck with national player Dumisani Mpofu diverting a Dumisa Ngobe shot into this own net after Stewart Murisa had given CAPS an early lead and Gerald Stober levelled, but the visitors deserved to succeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pirates spent much of the match under pressure, but the experience gained from numerous African battles since the epic, title-winning campaign of 1995 stood the Buccaneers in good stead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Managing director Irvin Khoza believes his players have benefited enormously from their African adventures, notwithstanding the poor treatment they received in Nigeria before a cup tie against BCC Lions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Pirates are in action at FNB Stadium on Sunday afternoon, arch-rivals Kaizer Chiefs seek a victory over Michau Warriors at Johannesburg Stadium that will resuscitate a faltering championship challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the history of the first Castle Premiership is examined, last weekend may be viewed as the defining moment, more specifically the late goal Jerry Sikhosana scored to earn Pirates a draw with Chiefs in the Soweto derby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those sporting black and white and black and gold later agreed that only pacesetters Rangers gained from a share of the spoils and the Durban club need seven points from a possible 12 to clinch the R500 000 first prize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While relegation-haunted Warriors should offer dogged resistance to Chiefs, even in their own lair, Rangers travel north to Pietersburg for a showdown with lowly and unpredictable Real Rovers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Gladiators of the North have rarely lived up to their nickname this season, although a three-goal hiding dished out to Pirates was a reminder of what George Mathiba, Joel Seroba and Alex Bapela can do when on song.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counting the crowd may not prove too difficult when Witbank Aces host Wits University at Rand Stadium on Saturday, where the kickoff is 11am to accommodate those wishing to marvel at the skills of Juninho and Zola in the FA Cup final.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a victory can keep alive Aces' wafer- thin hopes of avoiding demotion to the United Bank First Division and resurgent Wits are unlikely to be accommodating, especially with coach Eddie Lewis barking from the sideline. Witbank, a formidable force 10 years ago, were the victims of their own fans last weekend after losing at home to Amazulu, with various objects being hurled at coach Steve Haupt and his players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sad end to a sad season for the Coal City Giants. Warriors remain favourites to join them in the lower division although Amazulu and Rovers are too close to the trapdoor for comfort.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - On Saturday Ruud Gullit (right) leads Chelsea out to face Middelsborough in the FA Cup final. But as manager he has another goal: to prove a point to those in his homeland who dismissed him as an ego in boots</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JUST before a recent match at Stamford Bridge, London home of Chelsea FC, a press photographer, bored perhaps by the on- pitch cavortings of a man dressed in an outsized lion costume, trained his lens on a couple of rows of seats in the main stand. The resulting picture, published in Total Football magazine, made instructive viewing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There, in the middle of it, sitting just behind Terry Venables, was Tony Blair. A couple of seats to his left was David Mellor (remember him?). And wasn't that Dickie Attenborough, just along from Chelsea's chairman Ken Bates? In the world of photo opportunities, a match at Stamford Bridge is clearly the place to be spotted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the same football club which, for most of its success-free recent history, has been poised on the brink of bankruptcy. Not the kind of thing the important would want to be associated with. But then those were the days before Ruud Gullit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a town thought to be at the cusp of hip, in a sport never reckoned so chic, Gullit is the catalyst who has made Chelsea the club of choice for the fashion-conscious. Gullit has made Chelsea swing again. Not only has he made them a persuasive team, not only has he brought players to the place capable of doing things with a football previously considered impossible in London SW12, his very presence lends the club a hint of sophistication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Odd then, that back home in Holland Gullit is dismissed as a cantankerous trouble- maker, an inveterate stirrer, an ego out of control. &quot;Since Chelsea got to the FA Cup final I've been asked by five different Dutch newspapers and magazines to explain what is it with the English and Gullit,&quot; says Simon Kuper, author of the seminal Football Against The Enemy, a writer fluent in Dutch and football. &quot;They just don't get it.  They figure it must be a joke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what is it about Ruud and the English? Does a foreign accent merely disguise hidden shallows? Or is he the real thing, and thus a prophet without honour in his own homeland?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth is that Gullit arrived in England with a bit of a reputation. He was wonderfully successful over a 15-year playing career with Feyenoord, Milan and Holland. Probably the best player of his generation, on the pitch he seemed to be everywhere with his great spray of dreadlocked hair, turning up in attack to score match-winning goals and then in defence to execute pinpoint tackles. And he used to smile a lot when he was playing. Which was odd, because his time with all three employers had been punctuated by disputes and sulks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his home country he was known as the man who rowed incessantly with managers, who was in a state of constant battle with team-mates, who absented himself permanently from the national team when it became clear the side was not to be fashioned around him. Although savvy to his skill, the fans tired of his tantrums; the nation never forgave him for messing up their chances of retaining the European Championship in 1992 by fomenting discontent in the dressing room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, cynics in the English game assumed that when manager Glenn Hoddle bought him to play for Chelsea in 1995, he was just another trophy signing. His talent was on the wane, punctured by injury; the bargain seemed to be that he would put a few bums on Stamford Bridge seats in exchange for a boot-load of cash and a lucrative move back home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coasting, however, is not in Gullit's nature: whatever the relaxed demeanour, he plays to win. One of his many barneys with the Dutch national team, for instance, was prompted by his distaste for the laissez- faire attitude of the younger squad members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if it was to be a short stay, then, Gullit wanted to make his mark at Chelsea. He quickly ingratiated himself into the dressing room by telling filthy jokes. The other players liked that in him: sure he was a star, but he wasn't stuck up.  Besides, on the pitch he played brilliantly, oozing verve and skill and versatility, transforming the team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was like an 18-year-old playing in a game of 12-year- olds,&quot; said his manager after one particularly glorious performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His presence seemed to lift the younger English players around him: Eddie Newton, Frank Sinclair and Michael Duberry suddenly looked a different class altogether when they were receiving his passes. You could tell the lads had taken to him for they soon gave him a nickname: Big Nose. As in Big John Wayne, there was nothing derogatory in the adjective. It was a mark of respect, a symbol of the scale of the man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was something else about the reception he received that pleased him. As with Eric Cantona at Manchester United, another footballer who takes himself seriously, Gullit found the lads quite happy not to get in the way of his ego, to let him be the one who called the shots. He found no rival in the Chelsea dressing room, no Baresi or Maldini to politic against him. In England players are too busy choreographing their goal celebrations or popping Deep Heat in each other's jock straps to plot and scheme. Anyway the lads thought he was worth listening to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When it comes to foreigners, English footballers are suffused with an odd combination of arrogance and inferiority.  Of course they can't get stuck in like we do, they haven't got the bottle for a wet Monday in Hartlepool, but, give them their due, they know about tactics. And Gullit had played with Milan, captained Holland, won the lot: you've got to have respect for his views on the overlapping wing-back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's very intelligent, amusing and laid back,&quot; says BBC Sport's Niall Sloane, the man who first put Gullit on British television screens as a match pundit. &quot;He comes across as very worldly, very wise.&quot; Just right as an idol for the newly gentrified game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't just bandwagon jumpers who took to him. The die- hards in the Chelsea crowd loved him too. At the end of Gullit's first season at Stamford Bridge, Hoddle departed for the England job. The strong likelihood was that George Graham, the Scots disciplinarian, would replace him as manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the stands those who had seen a chink of light in the football Gullit played didn't want to see that smothered by the master of the bore draw. At the last game of the 1995-96 season, as the players made their traditional end-of-year lap of honour, the entire ground united to sing: &quot;You can stick George Graham up your arse.&quot; And, showing they were not merely being negative: &quot;Ruud Gullit's blue and white army.&quot; Those who were there swear they saw in Gullit's eyes the germ of an idea forming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ken Bates was clearly on the same wavelength. When the chairman offered him Hoddle's job, Gullit accepted. Though there were to be conditions - lots of money to buy the players he wanted, no involvement in the day-to-day drudgery generally plopped into the in-tray of managers of British football clubs - here was a chance at last to fashion a side according to his own ideas. He would prove to his detractors that his way was the right way after all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armed with a cheque book supplied by Matthew Harding, Chelsea's late vice- chairman, Gullit went shopping. With excellent knowledge of the Continental game, he bought wisely, as with the Frenchman Franc Lebeouf. But the signings which showed he really meant business were those of Gianluca Vialli, Roberto Di Matteo and Gianfranco Zola. For the first time current Italian internationals were brought to England, plucked from the strongest league in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They came, in part, because of the money. They came too because of the promise of living in London. But they mainly came because of Gullit. His charisma - according to one Italian observer, he carried himself in Italy like a character in a Fellini film - sold them on being part of the action. For Chelsea fans, to find themselves watching world-class players was astonishing: no wonder they thought Gullit a divine intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thing the newcomers found was that unlike Bryan Robson, his rival big spender up at Middlesbrough, Gullit would not become a hostage to his new star signings' celebrity. He let them know they were lucky to be playing for him, not the other way round. None of them could guarantee a place in his team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Midway through this season, Gullit found that, in Mark Hughes, he had a better player than Vialli in the same position. He didn't hesitate to drop his big name (and old friend). The fall-out in the dressing room - with Vialli smarting from his humiliation - soured to the point where few could see how Chelsea would pull themselves together and win their FA Cup semi-final.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it happened, it all turned out for the good. Chelsea won and Vialli and Gullit ostentatiously hugged on the touchline at the match's end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afterwards, in the press conference, a perma-relaxed Gullit declared that rows are good for fostering team spirit, they clear the air. Besides, it gives players something to prove if they are dropped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The English football press accepted this analysis: Gullit was presented as the master of tactical nous. How he must have loved that. It made a real change for him to be regarded as a thinker rather than the compulsive arguer he had been cast as for so long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given in England the platform, the adoration, the undisputed acceptance that he is special that he has always craved, Gullit has blossomed. He is happy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in Holland, however, public opinion remains unconvinced: the consensus is that Gullit is not as clever as he thinks he is. Critics point out that his aphorisms which so entertain the British ear (&quot;You win the league by beating the small teams, not the big ones&quot;, or &quot;There is no need to be as holy as the Pope&quot;) are merely those Cruyff has used for the past 15 years. And, even if he has made Chelsea a better team, Gullit was starting from a low base. When he has won what Cruyff did as a manager, then they might take notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, when he leads his team out for the FA Cup final, Gullit will be looking to prove his countrymen wrong by plotting the tactics which will land the oldest trophy in world football.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - SOUTH AFRICA'S cycling fraternity will receive what some term a belated wake-up call when the African continent hosts the first-ever World Cup event in this sport in Stellenbosch this weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first leg of the prestigious Grundig UCI World Cup for mountain bikes in South Africa heralds the genesis, if event organiser Carinus Lemmer is to be believed, of a boom in mountain biking in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This particular brand of cycling consists of three disciplines, cross-country racing, dual slalom and down hill racing. Only the latter will be on show in Stellenbosch. If successful, it could ensure that South Afrca becomes a regular stop-over for events organised by the International Cycling Federation (UCI). The world's top mountain bikers have already converged on the Cape winelands with the enthusiasm generally associated with exponents of this adrenalin sport.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Australian Scott Sharples, ranked consistently among the world's top 10 riders: &quot;This sport regularly draws more than 20 000 spectators to events in Europe in America where the sport is really huge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the riders are really happy to be in South Africa and our first impression is that Stellenbosch is an ideal venue to host this event. I'm glad the sport has come to South Africa and I think you people still underestimate the impact this event will have on the sport here,&quot; said Sharples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hosting the event in Stellenbosch is a tribute to the vision of Lemmer, an ex- international cyclist, who insisted South Africa could host the event when others in the South African cycling fraternity belittled him for his over-enthusiasm.  &quot;There was a time when people here thought it was a pipe dream to host the event in Stellenbosch, but we pushed hard and eventually convinced the necessary people that we could it,&quot; said Lemmer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mountain biking is one of the top television sports in Europe, receiving regular coverage on the satellite channel Eurosport and MTV. These channels will broadcast the South African leg of the World Cup Down Hill, the first of six, to millions of viewers in Europe and America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1997 World Cup series culminates in the finals in August in Houfalize in Belgium. Lemmer says the majority of the more than 200 riders making the trip to South Africa believe the Stellenbosch stopover could be crucial towards deciding the eventual winner of the series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Included in the line-up of top riders are Anne-Caroline Chausson, the multiple women's world champion from France and Michael Ranning, the Australian junior world champion. Experts say Ranning is the most exciting prospect the sport has ever seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African hopes rest firmly on the shoulders of Capetonians Greg Miller and Erica Green. Miller is the current South African champion and Green became our first Olympic representative in mountain biking at last year's Atlanta Olympic Games.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The hard men chosen for the Lions squad arrive on Sunday, and the Springboks are looking particularly vulnerable at the moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THERE must surely be the realisation that, as was the case when this country was first re-admitted to the international arena five years ago, our rugby has again suffered the type of introverted arrogance of false belief that has allowed the rest of the world to leave us standing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just how deep the current malaise is will soon be demonstrated in two different areas: Northern Transvaal captain Adriaan Richter's insistence that the Super 12 will stand the resurgent Blue Bulls in good stead for the Currie Cup, and the arrival this weekend of the first professional version of the British Lions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both are rooted in the same old traditional evil of South African provincialism. But the latter is - or should be - the most worrying for this country and is not, as some would hazard to suggest, a platform for building a Springbok side to contest the subsequent tri-nation Sanzar Series against New Zealand and Australia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Springbok coach Carel du Plessis faces an unwelcome baptism, rooted deep in the inferno of near disarray. Any number of senior players are doubtful starters through injury or forced inactivity at top level against the Lions, thanks to the attrition of a Super 12 season that the South African Rugby Football Union has seen fit to contest on a provincial rather than a regional basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enough has already been said about the wisdom of the New Zealanders and Australians in first identifying their top players and then turning out Super 12 sides on a regionalised squad basis, adding selected strengths to already powerful sides and allowing some respite from the sheer physical demands of the competition for those players who need it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not a coincidence that the team which has done best in Super 12 over the past two seasons has been Ian McIntosh's Natal combination. Like all the South African sides, the Banana Bafana have been riddled with injury. But McIntosh has used his available talent sparingly and well, both developing players by letting them play at this level and substituting with an astuteness that must surely have been one of the major catalysts of the change in the laws on swopping players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It could well be argued that the Lions have many of the same problems in the attempted blending of four nations into a rugby transitory commonwealth that apply to rigidly drawn provincial loyalties in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it must also be remembered that manager Fran Cotton and coach Ian McGeechan come from long backgrounds - and successful ones at that - in the overcoming of such divisions, both having been integral parts of the great side of 1974 under Willie John McBride. They have also assembled a squad which is aimed primarily at negating the strengths of the Springbok machine so clinically put together by former national coach Kitch Christie to win the World Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Du Plessis, as yet untested as an originator of Springbok strategy - he gets his first chance against Tonga at Newlands on June 10 - has a little over two weeks to refine his thinking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By June 2, the new coach must pencil in the names of a squad to take him through a bruising and congested season; a side to beat the Lions and carry through to the Sanzar test which follows. And he has to do so in the full knowledge that players of the stature of Kobus Wiese, Mark Andrews, Andre Joubert, James Dalton, Jacques Olivier, Japie Mulder and Hennie le Roux are on the walking wounded list, and that the likes of Fritz van Heereden and James Small have been languishing in the Nite Series and have played no part in the Super 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Du Plessis also has a captain in Gary Teichmann who - on recent evidence - has played himself into a state of near exhaustion and is rightly being rested by McIntosh this weekend. Inspiration and leadership do not come from a tired mind and a body racked by the type of physical pounding that is at the core of Teichmann's huge-hearted game. McIntosh at least has the sense to see this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also does no good to point at any differences - real or imagined - between rugby as it is played in the two opposing hemispheres. Martin Johnson's Lions are no hastily assembled bunch of whipping boys. Cotton &amp; Co have put together a side with the full understanding that playing the Springboks in South Africa is a demanding and arduous business. They have, for the most part, looked at the hard men to do the job, opting for veterans of rugby league like Scott Quinnell, John Bentley, Scott Gibbs, Allan Bateman, David Young and Alan Tait to take on the South African forwards and breach the much-vaunted Springbok defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This they have done at the expense of leaving out players like Mike Catt, whose first-hand knowledge of South African conditions and playing mentality from his own days at Eastern Province would, to most minds, have assured him of a spot in the 35-strong squad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have gone for the hard men and perhaps, in the light of history, this is the right decision. Arguably, the last Lions tour under England lock Billy Beaumont 17 winters ago, did not and paid the price in a raft of injuries that all but sunk the tour. South Africans by nature tend to play their game in a physical manner, and the hard grounds of the Highveld are as unyielding as the men who regularly play on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have yet to assess whether the Lions' selectors have made the right choices in the components they intend putting together. And whether having used the opening eight matches of a tough tour itinerary as an assembly line for the Test machine, whether that machine can indeed run efficiently. One believes that this will indeed be the case. Cotton has not built a sports good empire through lack of forethought or a dearth of planning, and he knows as much about South African rugby as anyone in the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He will know - as will his players before the final Test on July 5 rolls around - that quartering the country is as tough as facing the opposition, which in itself is difficult enough, with the easiest matches likely to be those against the crash- tackling Border side and the hard men of Mpumalanga in the coal mining country round Witbank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It could just be that the arduous nature of the tour - allied to the ardent provincialism of the sides who all want a victory over the Lions - could work in Du Plessis's favour.  This has been the case in the past and there is no reason to suspect that 1997 will be any different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But again, Cotton has anticipated this and neatly side- stepped any comparisons with McBride's tourists by saying that it is the tests - and only the tests - that hold any significance in the greater picture of the coming tour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this he shares common ground with Du Plessis. The tests are what really matter. But that said, the itinerary, which looks so daunting, could work to the distinct advantage of the tourists, most of them now rested after the northern season and ready to use the tour to play themselves back to top fitness and form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But most importantly, the Lions will provide an accurate gauge to the way we play, the way we think and the way we react to a game that changes on an almost daily basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an examination in which the pedigree of World Cup champions alone will amount to little or nothing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Shirley Kossick</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PENGUIN BOOK OF INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S STORIES edited by Kate Figes (Viking, R108,95)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THIS is an excellent collection of 33 short stories drawn from various parts of the world and covering a wide diversity of subjects. There is no obvious theme or thread unifying the collection, and in her rather perfunctory introduction Kate Figes offers no clear rationale for her choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taken together as a cross-section of women's interests and differing narrative techniques, however, the stories form a fascinating group. Herself a linguist with Arabic and Russian at her fingertips, Figes has not been afraid to venture outside the English-speaking world. She includes two stories from China, and one each from Japan, Peru, Lebanon, Egypt, France, Germany, Argentina, Uruguay, Cuba and two from Russia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The collection opens on a chilling note with Nineteen Fifty- Five by Alice Walker, which deals with the exploitation of a black songwriter by a white superstar. The story is funny at times, but this does not ameliorate the ruthlessness of the Elvis- like figure, or the irreparable loss to Gracie Mae, the victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This shapely and well-written story sets a high standard which is ably sustained by the subsequent pieces. Among these, The Jewess by Irene Dische is one of the longest and most intriguing. Perhaps intimating something of the author's own anxiety about her German-Austrian heritage and her chequered career, she tells a moving story of German-Jewish exile. The emotional confusion she reflects is one of the less overtly dramatic yet no less crippling effects of racial hatred and persecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family life and childhood figure quite prominently in the collection. Helen Simpson's masterly Heavy Weather poignantly details the burdens and the weariness of young motherhood, while Maria Elena Llano's In the Family evokes the tensions and conflicts of blood relationships. Always wonderful on children, Janet Frame is up to her customary level in The Reservoir, which conveys the thrill of deliberate disobedience. In an equally vivid tale, Anita Desai feelingly depicts the pain and fearfulness of discovering one's own insignificance in an uncaring world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another Anglo-Indian writer included here is Bharati Mukherjee, whose A Wife's Story suggests the clash of cultures between East and West. This theme is also explored in Bi Shumin's Broken Tranformers, which describes the unexpected effects of a flood of American toys into China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the more familiar inclusions are Nadine Gordimer, Ellen Gilchrist, Bessie Head, Isabel Allende, Margaret Atwood, Alison Lurie, and Shena Mackay. It is not possible within the confines of a review to discuss each story or even to mention each writer, but Angela Carter's The Bloody Chamber forces itself to the forefront of one's mind for special mention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is an archetypal Bluebeard story, but infused with a modern sensibility and awareness of psychological possibilities. Though the story itself is bizarre and melodramatic - as well as erotic at times - it hints at universal truths underlying its baroque surface.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As with any anthology, it is always possible to quibble.  Certainly in this case, and in the absence of any stated criteria, Figes's selection seems to be highly personal but it is also most discriminating. There is not a dud among the entire 33 stories and all make for gripping reading. With the useful headnotes on each writer and the variety offered, this is a thoroughly enjoyable collection.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - AT Western Platinum Mine in Mooi Nooi, near the Magaliesberg, a group of mine employees is rehearsing a play. They are putting the final touches on Shortcuts. The group is called Thuto ke Lesedi, which means Education is Light. Formed just over a year ago, Thuto ke Lesedi has, with the help of Shoestring Productions, developed three programmes that have been performed 15 times internally and 13 times at other mines.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortcuts is a melding of the safety and team-building programme developed by Thuto ke Lesedi. The play uses a combination of mime, song and performance to illustrate safety issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first programme was developed to promote Abet, an adult basic education programme that mine workers can join, to get anything from standard eight to matric. All people need these school qualifications to progress within the mine hierarchy.  Shoestring Productions, an industrial theatre company, was brought in as a consultancy to develop a training group that would operate from within the mine and use theatre techniques as a vehicle with which to educate. A poster advertising for volunteers interested in acting was put up. Twelve people applied and Thuto ke Lesedi was born.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Louis Rathubane, leader of the group and branch secretary for the National Union of Mineworkers, says that the first programme was overwhelmingly successful. Abet attendance grew visibly after the performances. &quot;The power of theatre,&quot; says Rathubane, &quot;is that it can educate people not to become victims. We want to fight apathy; we want to improve communication skills.&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Theatre becomes a visual form of education, a tool with which to communicate,&quot; agrees David Germond, Shoestring's project co-ordinator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second programme Thuto ke Lesedi developed dealt with safety issues underground. Such was the success of the programme that Western Platinum Mine achieved &quot;the million shift fatality-free&quot; as well as winning the Mclean Shield, the national award for safety, twice. This is an achievement that Thuto ke Lesedi can take major credit for. &quot;Perhaps we could take these issues of safety further, into the community,&quot; says another team mate. The third programme deals with team-building and also enjoyed a high success rate. The group uses the stacking and balancing of brooms to illustrate working together. &quot;Unity is power,&quot; they sing, as they lift their brooms against the backdrop of the mine workshop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I ask Rathubane if there is a split focus for him. He is working within a management- directed programme. &quot;I believe it is time management and the union join and try to work together,&quot; he replies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The plays are a neutral voice for management and the union,&quot; says Germond.&quot; It is Shoestring's goal that Thuto ke Lesedi become totally self sufficient.&quot; Germond has trained the group to workshop plays and now operates as an adviser. They rehearse three hours a week and the operation is voluntary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thuto's status within the mine is the same as any other of the teams. They have their own T-shirts and baseball caps and provide an added extra-mural activity for the members of the group. These people are strongly committed to their cause and to their teamwork.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Cultural development in South Africa is being revolutionised by daring new projects. We visit the grassroots</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW VOYAGES has the name Robert Hodgins stamped all over it.  And that's not simply because the eternally young septuagenarian artist curated the show. It lies also in the overall feel of the exhibition and its painterly focus. It's in the way Hodgins - arguably South Africa's finest living painter - describes the works on view in terms of colour, use of materials and the magic of applying paint to canvas in words dripping with passion. And it is in his plea to the public to support the show - the proceeds go to Streetwise, the organisation devoted to street children - that makes it so indelibly his.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sponsored by PGSI, this is the the second year of a project in which an established artist is invited to curate an exhibition of his own choice. Last year, painter David Koloane selected a show of works assembled from everyday scraps which turned the normally sparse Newtown Galleries into a curiosity bazaar. This year, Hodgins scoured technikons and universities countrywide, &quot;scuttling like a demented crab&quot; in search of suitable, adventurous works by young artists. Initially he came up with 200 possibilities, which were finally whittled down to 35.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wanted to focus on art that Jo'burg doesn't normally see that much anymore - free of isms - and work in which the artists are absorbed with the joy of handling colour and paint.  Given the broader mission of the show, I avoided subject matter that was too risqu'.&quot; He adds: &quot;Anyway I'm bored to death with the sight of another penis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, penises, pudenda, death, decadence and other subject matter for the creatively challenged are patently absent from the show. And while one can hardly call a show that treads on ancient painterly turf New Voyages, what the show lacks in terms of the untamed and untried, it makes up for in technical acumen, and the odd revelation, on the part of several of its young participants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the national flavour of the show, it is worth noting the different styles of figurative painting emerging from the various regions. For example, Pretoria seems to have spawned a crop of young painters who succeed in capturing a sense of dislocation typical of the global MTV generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are no specific markers or points of reference in the works; there's no indication of place. Merely of the vacuous times in which we live. Something similar can be said of the Durban-based Malini Moorvan's painted multi-cultural mug shots on wood. Banal portraits of anonymity, they are nevertheless endearing in their simplicity and exploration of different materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the exhibition doesn't exactly knock you over the head with its semantic resonances, it at least reveals that some young South African artists are still concerned with the manual processes of making art. Durbanite Rhett Martin's diptych, for example, is an essay in paint, thickly applied so that the monochromatic surfaces appear like rough-edged relief sculptures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a whole, the exhibition fails to reverberate beyond the noble intentions of its sponsors, the energy of its curator and the efforts of the artists. But it does reinforce the truism that the alchemy of art lies as much in the making as in the reading of it. For young artists - many of whom will have discarded their creative tools before the age of 30 in an increasingly art-unfriendly world - it is essential to learn a more traditional language of art-making, like painting, before trashing it in favour of the ready- made. And it this obvious joy in painterly process that makes New Voyages worth more than the sum of its parts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Voyages is on at Newtown Galleries in Johannesburg until May 31 Hilton Tennant's airbrush painting of a young man, head thrown back, features blurred and pelvis exposed against an unpainted background, could be read either as a trendy ad for designer jeans, or as the depiction of post-Nineties alienation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - HENNIE SERFONTEIN is an avuncular, bearded man who looks like a boer. But he's one of South Africa's leading progressive journalists, a documentary film-maker and a charming, deeply committed man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born in Pretoria, he had an ordinary Afrikaans boyhood, then enlightenment. In 1963 Serfontein joined the Progressive Party as PRO. He wrote for several years under a pseudonym and was involved in the first expos' of the Broederbond.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the 1980s, between stints for the Sunday Times, Rand Daily Mail and Vrye Weekblad, Serfontein filed news for overseas television, concentrating mainly on the interplay between the church and politics. In 1990 he made History of an Afrikaner Prophet, a profile of Beyers Naude. But this recent work is his most impressive yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Man Without Fear is an insightful and thorough look at the life of Desmond Tutu. It follows his fortunes from being the barefoot urchin boy from Tshing, near Ventersdorp, who contracted polio and TB through his confrontations with the regime, his call for sanctions, his role as &quot;the man who buried most of the activists in the 1980s&quot; and the Nobel peace prize, all the way to being chairman of the TRC. It's not a travelogue of history but the film succeeds because it gets into the man's mind. We even get to know about his hobbies: &quot;Eating, sleeping, reading and drinking rum and coke.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film took over eight months to make. Serfontein says he didn't want to rush something off in a week or do a 20-minute interview with Tutu behind his office desk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film is immensely moving and doesn't use sensationalism or soap-box rhetoric in the way it recalls the horrors of apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1981 Serfontein was asked by the SABC to take part in a debate on the state of the republic. &quot;I was in two minds about it, but many friends said I should participate. Beyers Naude told me I must do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The night before, he got a call from the corporation to say it was sorry but the panel was a full and it had to drop him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifteen years later his films are being made with the full support of the SABC. I hope they're chuffed with the results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Man Without Fear airs this Sunday, May 18, at 6pm on SABC3</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serfontein, however believes, that documentaries about the players in South African history shouldn't only concentrate on the big names. No Man's Man, a profile of one-time PAC activist and now Chief Lands Commissioner Joe Seremane proves the point.  &quot;No one knew about him,&quot; the director says. But the film, which screened on SABC a few months ago, is a riveting look at the life of an activist who once said the only way whites would understand is if they had their children's heads chopped off and has now fully accepted reconciliation. Again the emphasis is on telling history, both personal and political in an anecdotal way.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MM: You've been recording for seven years. Has it been difficult?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaheen: It's been hard, but I'm glad we've been through it - all types of crazy-shit censorship - but we had to because we were the country's only hip-hop group. We laid the foundations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ready D: Everything we achieved was self- taught - how you DJ, scratch, programme ... And we had to learn about the industry. They taught us they couldn't fuck us up. One label didn't want to put money into marketing us, the usual ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaheen: Now it's easy to work with kids and warn them about these things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MM: You've played with major hip-hop artists like The Fugees, Afrika Bambataa and Ice T, how'd they react to POC's sounds?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaheen: It was cool, they knew we weren't on some clone type thing ... It was nice to be in contact with artists from that side of the world who'd been through similar things to us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MM: Even mainstream artists?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaheen: Well The Fugees told us about the bullshit they had to go through on their first album.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MM: A lot of the guys who want to do hip- hop say record companies all tell them to do kwaito?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ready D: It's the same shit all over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaheen: Record companies are nothing but banks. At the end of the day they want to make money or their asses are on the line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MM: You guys have had financial troubles?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramone: All the time, it's still a struggle to walk around with a few cents in our pockets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ready D: Basically all the money we make is put back into the group; into hip-hop culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MM: So it's not about money?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaheen: Yes it is! This is our career! It's about survival.  There are families involved (all except Shaheen have kids).  There comes a time when you have to make certain compromises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MM: What compromises?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaheen: Going overseas is a compromise for me, I'd rather stay at home, I'm pan- Capetonian ... I'm kidding, I think there's a lot of work to be done here; help kids involved in hip-hop. Imagine being overseas while one of your family is sick. It's whack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramone: Then again staying here you miss out on everything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MM: Who'd you like working with the most?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ready D: Spearhead, Show and AG, and Afrika Baambaata ...  They were the most interested in what was happening, The Fugees as well, they were happy to exchange phone numbers. Some people you can't even get next to ... James Brown was nice, that was one of the best live shows I've ever seen ... whoo his dancers!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark: All over they were surprised to see breakdancing from here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MM: How big is breaking in SA?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ready D: In Cape Town it's massive, it's the Mecca. There people have been involved in the hip-hop community - like us, Black Noise, The Anonymous Hip-Hop Crew - giving workshops on how to DJ, how to breakdance. But Jo'burg has some nice MCs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MM: So why're so few people getting signed, the only albums this year have been yours (Ghetto Code was released three weeks ago) and the Muthaload compilation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaheen: Man, this industry is fucked up; they're scared to invest. A local white rock group will get a deal and get promoted, but with black groups ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MM: Why do you think POC record sales have been so low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ready D: Because our records, songs and videos were banned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MM: Ishmael, what were you guys trying to do on Ghetto Code?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ishmael: We were trying to tone it all down n'?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ready D: He was trying to tone it all down!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ishmael: I was joking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ready D: When we started recording this album in London there was a very passive vibe. We were homesick, that's why there's a lot of local slang - topics that reflect the mood we were in. It's a lot slower and a lot easier to dance to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MM: The album has an anti-drug, anti-gang message. What do you think of Pagad?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ready D: It's a very touchy subject, I can't speak for everybody ... all I can say is I support anybody who's there for the freedom and liberation of people on every level: drugs, gangs, education, politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MM: What local music do you like?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark: I like Trompies, they've got a lekker different style.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaheen: Bheki Mseleku, Abdullah Ibrahim ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ready D: Chiskop and Tsitibana are not that tired type of kwaito.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaheen: I heard some of the new Boomslang. Yo, nice stuff man! Some different stuff, experimental. People aren't exposed to enough different types of music ...</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durban - Durban's fashion event of the year has been accused of being 'too white and very incestuous'. SUZYBELL witnessed parts of the cat-fight</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A MONTH before the glitz and glam of the Durban Designer Collection (DDC) an outspoken Durban model boss had an interdict slapped on him by The Saturday Paper, producers of the event, gagging him for mouthing off that the organisers were racist. Some say it was just sour grapes because his models weren't chosen. Others say it's because DDC's such an &quot;incestuous white affair''.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Controversial model boss Suren Pather voiced his frustrations in writing, sending faxes to practically every newspaper in the country, in a bid to break what has been dubbed ''the white monopoly fashion event''. For some, the DDC's casting of models smacks of collusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jason Fiddler, modelling boss of 3rd Millennium Men in Durban had one of his models short-listed but the model wasn't chosen for this year's DDC. &quot;There is a tremendous pool of talent in KwaZulu-Natal, and unfortunately this talent has little or no access to the wonderful opportunity and platform that the DDC provides,&quot; he said. &quot;This can obviously make people feel bitter. Whatever the selection procedures used by the DDC, for choosing models and designers, it still excludes those who could contribute to its success. The organisers of the DDC are entitled to run the event as they choose, but a little sense and sensibility should be used when dealing with the sensitive nature of the Durban fashion community.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding Pather's accusations that the DDC is racist, Fiddler said: &quot;Racism is not the issue here. Elitism is possibly the issue. Many professionals in Durban feel they didn't have the chance to benefit from the spotlight the DDC provides. If discrimination is happening it does so on a personality-based level. The DDC should be more demographically representative of the market. It's business after all. But I do find it rather ironic that a newspaper, a supposed champion of free speech, would resort to using legal means to prevent someone form exercising theirs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Durban designer in this year's DDC, which is now in its 18th year, said; &quot;It was just sour grapes for some. There's so much bitchiness in the fashion industry and Pather has ruffled a lot of feathers with his controversial letter. He had some valid points about it being a monopoly, but do the DDC organisers have to ask all agencies to come to the castings?  It's about the designers, after all, not the models. These agents are just fighting over money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And the DDC is white dominated because it's not an African show. Not everyone can afford to fork out R4 000 to R10 000 to make a range, plus paying a fee of R600 to the DDC to put on the show. African people don't go to the DDC because it's not aimed at their market.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another Durban modelling boss, who didn't want to be named, said: &quot;It's a case of it's our show so don't bother to pitch to the castings. Why call it the Durban Designers show if no new designers and new models get a chance? I also speak on behalf of the make-up artists, hairstylists and lighting people who would like to be given a chance at organising the DDC, because every year they use the same team. It's an unhealthy clique.  How come the producer of the show, Debbie Reynolds, jols with the whole DDC team and the same model bosses? She puts them into the show because they're her friends.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DDC producer, Debbie Reynolds, lifestyle editor of a Durban newspaper said: &quot;There's absolutely no collusion and we do have an open casting. No one can accuse of us racism as four of the 20 females are black and out of the 10 male models in the show, half are black.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet another Durban modelling boss said the general impression is that the DDC favours the Leigh Downing modelling agency (Leigh Downing herself is a judge this year). &quot;It is not an open casting, but they make out that it is,'' she said. &quot;We need to create competition among the current DDC team to get us excited about it again. Each agency should be given an opportunity to style our models with our music as a presentation. We need to build up healthy competition, because some agencies now don't bother about the DDC because we all know each year which models will get chosen, it's so predictable.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pather of Boss Models said: &quot;We've cast for nine years now at the DDC and we never get in. It's common knowledge that they use the same agencies and the same models and the same crew.  Everyone is scared to speak out against the organisers but I just had enough.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another model boss whinged that the DDC doesn't even hold auditions for the castings, but chooses from photographs to make a short-list: &quot;The DDC is very much a white affair in the old SA style. 80% of the people there on the evenings of the DDC are white - they're behind the times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But they think they're with it because they're using black and coloured people in their adverts and street posters.'' Two of the models posing in the DDC advert aren't even in the show.  The female model, Linda Pillay is now in London and Thokozani Mthiyane is a Durban actor who was asked to pose for the photograph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DDC is on at the N-Shed in Durban harbour tonight and tomorrow (May 16 and 17) The band Interitmo will kick-start the event</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pretoria - Anticipating International Museums Day on Sunday May 18, STEPHEN GRAY visits the African Window</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new African Window - part of a developing belt or mall of museums in downtown Pretoria - is the first suitable home there has ever been for that city's vast Museum of Culture. Six exhibit spaces are already up, in a venue that will eventually hold tenfold. At the opening last March, Satour, together with the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, officially launched their three-year campaign to push from nature- based to cultural tourism. The new-look museum goes with the policy: stroll in, grab a heritage.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, museum styles need to change. Here is an Ndebele- style mural along the fine walk-in; a shining canopy overhead, inspired either by a Voortrekker wagon- train or a post-modern songololo, depending on your preferred old South African conditioning; a deputy director who strides out to greet one, wearing a ponytail. And baby-changing facilities, yes, also in the men's toilet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the disabled the situation is good as well. Being none too computer literate, I tend to dread anything hands-on. I used rather to keep my own and everyone else's culture at arms' length. But multi- participation is of course the new way. If, while admiring the rainbow collection of representative holdings, I had not tapped out a tentative query on the keyboard, I would have been excluded, because in that machine is where the captions are. Makes a change from the days of curiosity cabinets and &quot;Do Not Touch&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I concede that, without that computer, I would have been denied access, as were most South Africans to their country's treasures until recently. And now there they all are, accumulated over the last century and simply stored away. The extent is mind- boggling. There are an astounding 3,75- million items from which curators may select.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By sheer fluke I tapped out A15: a pair of buckle-up leather sandals. Well, it turns out those flat, flabby sandals had been worn by no less than General Smuts on his summer rambles. And who then had made them for him, as a gift, while he languished in one of the general's prisons? None other than his coeval and adversary, that other lawyer, Mohandas Gandhi. I had found for myself the story I need to know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here is another. The African Window is in a building which, during the First Anglo-Boer War in 1880, the invading British called the Convent Redoubt, and which they fortified. There they were besieged for 100 days, before being evicted. Then in a neat reversal, after the Jameson Raid in 1896, President Kruger locked up all the reformers inside it. But there is more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the Brits had thoroughly taken over, in 1922 the same building became a branch office of their Royal Mint. Eventually it was our own rand factory. Five years ago planning began for yet another change: the most secure building in Africa had to be converted from keeping the people out to inviting them in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now one of the exhibitions has actually been done by people's choice, and the people have chosen - out of those nearly 4- million parcels ferreted away in brown- paper and string: making music. So there is all the range of African instruments - from the mbila and the phalaphala made from gemsbok horns, to music-boxes, violins and dome-headed steam- radios.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was ready for the pith helmet and the original Stoney ginger beer bottle. At the Mazawattee Tea Tin I suddenly remembered what as a child I thought was happening to that granny and her tea-guzzling progeny (because they both wore glasses, tannin was rendering them blind). I could handle the glorious lacquered Twyfelaar Spider, which gets a niche of its own and is so named because you never knew if it went forwards or backwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I backtracked, spotted an engraved rhino on the huge rubbing stone, the beaded waistcoat, tried to find the miniature Jabulani Spaza Store (which is a radio set), ventured out again. I am happy to report to parents that for children, who are seldom embarrassed about getting lost, the staff organises treasure hunts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Museum personnel, I learn, talk of their displays as having scripts. For the moment, at the African Window, such scripts are in the vehicular language of English (brave decision).  Displays are also captioned in Afrikaans, Northern Sotho and Zulu, and guided tours are given in another three official languages. Why such scrupulousness, when everyone knows that all those tourists will speak American anyway? I would like to think that they are not what this wonderful place is really for. Mostly it is there for South Africans at last to meet themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African Window is on Visagie Street in Pretoria, with ample parking, open seven days a week, 9am to 5pm</SPAN></P>
