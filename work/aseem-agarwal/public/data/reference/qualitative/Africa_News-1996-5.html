<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The semi-official Sunday Mail newspaper said Mugabe had revealed that he would tie the knot in mid-August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This ends the year-long speculation surrounding the president's marital status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A local weekly newspaper was last year taken to court after carrying an article saying President Mugabe had married Marufu in a private ceremony during the 1995 Easter holidays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mugabe later said he would publicly announce any intention to marry &quot;when the time is due.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The chairwoman of the Pan-African Women's Organisation, Thenjiwe Lesabe, urged African women Sunday to re-dedicate themselves to their complete liberation and to guarding their dignity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;PAWO was and still is dedicated to assisting African women fight for their emancipation and effective integration in the process of economic, social and cultural development,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She was addressing the organisation's special Southern Africa Regional Secretariat meeting in Harare. She said the economic crises in most African countries tended to affect girls severely.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have to work out strategies to save girl children because these are future mothers who will mould our future generations,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But planning these strategies has been hampered by the organisation's inability to meet regularly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lesabe, who is also Zimbabwe's minister for national affairs, employment creation and co-operatives, said the main stumbling block was that no country was willing to host the regional meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PAWO is affiliated to the Organisation of African Unity and to the United Nations. Its aim is to ensure that women's concerns are brought to the attention of the highest policy making bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a message read on her behalf, PAWO Secretary-General Ruth Neto, said since the creation of the PAWO some 34 years ago, seven congresses, several council meetings, symposia and other statutory meetings had taken place but a number of countries had failed to pay their contributions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the last congress held in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso in 1992, only 22 members out of 52 attended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said some four years later, when PAWO was preparing to undertake another council meeting in preparation to the eighth congress, most of resolutions had not materialised due to lack of participation and failure to pay their contributions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Neto said now that all African countries were free, with the exception of some West African countries still struggling for democracy, PAWO should adjust to the reality of their respective countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;PAWO should adjust itself to the new reality of our respective countries, by prosecuting the struggle for recognition and application of the rights of African women to participate in the decision making, in political, economic, cultural and social affairs at national and international levels,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PAWO has its headquarters in Angola and has five regional secretariats, for Northern, Central, Western, Eastern and Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MBABANE, Swaziland (PANA) - Schools will re-open again in Swaziland next Tuesday, the kingdom's National Association of Teachers Central Executive announced in Mbabane Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It took the Swazi King Mswati less than an hour Saturday afternoon to end a nationwide teachers strike that has been on for the past four weeks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing some 6000 teachers assembled in the gardens of the State Palace here, the 28 year-old King gently chided the teachers for delaying referring their problems to him after all legal channels used in their negotiations with the government had failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The king requested the teachers to go back to their classess and begin teaching whilst their leaders return to the negotiations table with the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> King Mswati left no doubt in the minds of the teachers that their demand for an 18 percent salary increase instead of 9.9 percent, recently raised to 10.94 percent offered by government must remain a pipe dream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the King indicated he would not be asking them to go back to school whilst negotiations continued unless he believed some sort of compromise was possible. He said he would expect to be kept fully and regularly informed as to the progress of the new round of negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Confirming the teachers acceptance of the king's decision, the Swaziland National Association of Teachers Central Executive's acting president, Phineas Mag, issued a statement thanking the him for his intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He informed the nation in a radio broadcast that the schools would reopen this coming Tuesday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The controversial Zimbabwean feature film &quot;Flame&quot;, fresh from the world renowned Cannes Film Festival, will be released in Zimbabwe next month, director Simon Bright said on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bright said the Junior Chambers (Jaycees) would hold a premiere of the film on July 23 before it goes on circuit in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bright said the film had been a big success at the French festival and played to full houses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The film did very well at Cannes, the audiences really loved it. It was invited to other film festivals in North Korea, Montreal and the Amian festival in November,&quot; said Bright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said there was a scene when a Japanese burst into tears when she saw the main actor in Flame, Marian Kunonga, at the awards presentations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Flame ignited controversy during the early stages of production when police seized parts of the film on allegations that it was subversive and parts of it pornographic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The film was later cleared and released back to the producers but Zimbabwe's war veterans associations objected to the film saying it was a denigration of the country's struggle and showed women in bad light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The board of censors approved the film with a no under 16 age restriction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigerian soccer fans quickly named their Olympic team &quot;The Dream Team&quot; shortly after it shoved aside Zimbabwe to qualify for its fourth Olympic appearance since its debut in Mexico in 1968.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria's best result in the event was a 3-3 draw against Brazil, having failed to go beyond the first round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This month in Atlanta, Nigeria will be lining up against soccer heavyweights Brazil, Hungary and Japan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On paper, the dream team appears well balanced and prepared to do the nation proud, especially with the crop of players already in camp in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The list of 18 players released last week by the Nigerian Football Association showed preference for foreign-based stars to their locally-based ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The team reads like a who's who in Nigerian youth soccer. It was drawn mainly from the under-17 squad that won the World Cup in 1993 in Japan and the under-20 team which took bronze in the FIFA Africa '95 tournament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Babayaro brothers (Emmanuel and Celestine), Taribo West, skipper Kanu Nwankwo, Tijani Babangida, Wilson Oruma, Teslim Fatusi, Augustine Okocha, Victor Ikpeba, Abiodun Obafemi, Garba Lawal, Sunday Oliseh, Kingsley Obiekwu, Mobi Oparaku and Joseph Dosu, are all richly endowed with talent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They join forces with three over-aged players allowed in by the International Olympic Committee -- Uche Okechukwu, Emmanuel Amunike and Daniel Amokachi -- to fly the nation's flag at the centennial games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria's opponents at Atlanta '96 -- Japan, Hungary and Brazil - are no new comers to Olympic soccer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hungary is the most successful of the four in the group, winning the Olympic soccer title a record three times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Hungarians, on paper the weakest in the group, won in 1952 in Helsinki, Finland, 1964 in Tokyo, Japan, and in 1968 in Mexico City, Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their first outing in 1912 in Stockholm, Sweden, earned them a fifth place. They were third eight years later in Rome in 1960 and second in 1972 in Munich, Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Brazilians, considered the traditional world soccer power, have surprisingly not done very well in Olympic soccer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They were fifth in 1952 and fourth in 1976 in Montreal, Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On current form, Nigeria and Brazil look set to advance to the next round. But Nigeria must first put its house in order if it intends to improve on its previous performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stories of unpaid allowances and refusal by some players to report early in camp are worrisome developments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria must also watch out for the Brazilian soccer machine, which mercilessly destroyed Ghana's Olympic team by a whopping eight goals to one in a pre-Olympiad friendly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigerian squad temporarily lost its dream team tag when it was demolished 3-1 by lowly-rated Togo recently. It, however, appears to have rekindled confidence in its fans after it held the Unites States team to a goal-less draw recently in Pomona (United States).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That confidence will have to be sustained in the team's action on and off the field, to justify its qualification for the Atlanta Olympiad.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Production during the first six months of 1995 stood at 11.66 tones, then worth 120 million U.S dollars.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chamber, which has already projected annual gold output might, for the first time, surpass 25 tones this year, was disappointed by June's production of 1,862,53 kg, which was 8 percent lower than what was obtained the previous month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We don't really know what caused production to fall...(but) if the trend continues, we might reach 25 tones,&quot; an official of the chamber said on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On a month by month basis, gold output in January 1996 reached 2,211.47 kg, dropping to 1,912.82 kg in February. It climbed 6 percent to 2,023.48 kg in March and 2,135.16 kg in April, and dropped slightly in May to 2,031.14 kg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimbabwean gold mines were expected to sustain production on the back of rising world demand.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oil accounted for 280 million dollars, or 98.6 percent, of Nigeria's exports to the South American country. Leather goods, cashew nuts and rubber accounted for the other four million dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sugar accounted for 56 percent, or 136.4 million dollars, of Nigeria's imports from Brazil. Trucks, printing and packaging paper, steel products, automobile spares, and luxury buses accounted for the rest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Brazil is expected to sell a large quantity of bauxite and aluminum to Nigeria in 1997, when the West African country opens its giant aluminum smelting plant in Ikoti-Abasi in the south-eastern part of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the current increase in trade between the two countries, the embassy predicts that Nigeria's imports from Brazil could hit the 500 million dollar mark by the year 2000.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NIAMEY, Niger (PANA) - The Police in Niamey used tear gas Wednesday, to disperse hundreds of supporters of political parties who were to attend a rally in the capital of Niger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A few people were wounded and others arrested by police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rally was called by leaders of political parties which fielded candidates in the presidential election held on Sunday and Monday. Official results gave a 52.20 percent victory to Gen. Ibrahim Bare Mainassara, head of the military junta which took power on January 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tension hit Niger after Monday's dissolution of the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI) by Gen. Mainassara, who accused it of bias in favour of his challengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The same day, the military ruler appointed another electoral commission to replace the CENI. It was this commission that announced his victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Tuesday evening, the Union of Niger Workers (USTN) called for an indefinite strike, starting Thursday, to demand the re-instatement of the independent commission.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambia is to spend an estimated 10 million U.S dollars on this year's presidential, parliamentary and local government polls, election officials said Thursday in the capital, Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joel Sikazwe, Deputy Director of Elections, told journalists that eight million dollars was earmarked for the general elections (presidential and parliamentary) while the local government polls were to cost 2.5 million dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zambian government in 1995 signed an 18-million-dollar contract with a private Israeli firm, Nikuv Computers, to update the national voters roll.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sikazwe said the voters cards printed by Nikuv would be distributed to registered voters soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said last week that a total of 2.3 million voters had been registered by Nikuv, some 600,000 less than those on the previous roll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some anomalies have, however, been detected in the voters cards printed by Nikuv in the United States. They include duplication of names, meaning that they appear on more than one roll. This could cause problems in the voting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some opposition parties, including the main opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP) of former president Kenneth Kaunda, have demanded that the registration of voters should be repeated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They have alleged that Nikuv had done a haphazard job so as to rig the polls in favour of the ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) of President Frederick Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is the first time since Zambia's independence in 1964 that a foreign company has been involved in the registration of voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIP and two other opposition parties earlier this year, lost a court application to nullify Nikuv's contract. An appeal has been lodged with the supreme court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposition has also charged that Nikuv is a cover for Mossad, the Israeli external intelligence agency, hired by the Chiluba government to help manipulate the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Nikuv's arrangement, all registered voters need to claim their voters cards to be able to cast their ballots in the forthcoming elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba has yet to announce the dates for both the general and local government elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - With only about two months left before the World Solar Summit opens in<BR>Harare, only 40,000 U.S dollars has been collected in cash and kind, for hosting the forum which is expected to cost 5.5 million U.S dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Austria and the European Union (EU) have made pledges towards the summit, to be held in the Zimbabwean capital September 16 and 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Austrian government pledged some 100,000 U.S dollars and the EU about 130,000 U.S dollars. The summit is expected to launch the &quot;World Solar Decade.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zimbabwe government has set up an organizing committee which has so far raised the equivalent of 39,049 U.S dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Authorities in Harare are already showing concern at the slow pace contributions are coming in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a news conference on Wednesday, Vice President Simon Muzenda, who is also chairman of the cabinet committee on state occasions, appealed to local organizations and the international community to contribute in cash and kind towards the summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is a challenge and singular honor that has been bestowed on us to host a summit that will spearhead a world programme which will concretely address issues of sustainable development,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muzenda said the Zimbabwean government's contribution to the summit would depend on the 1996/97 budget to be announced this month and also on the contributions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Zimbabwean government is trying its best to ensure that the summit is a success. We are certain that the government will do its best to raise the money required. It is an international effort, so other countries should also come in,&quot; Muzenda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said more than 200 heads of state and government and heads of international organizations and institutions had been invited but could not say how many had responded positively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some 14 committees have been set up to ensure the successful hosting of the summit being convened to solicit political support for the use of renewable energy technologies that are environmentally friendly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimbabwe stood to benefit from hosting the summit through technology transfer, which would result in an economic boom and improvement of standards of living, especially in rural and remote areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A 15-member world solar commission comprising heads of state, under the chairmanship of President Robert Mugabe, has already begun work on the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO)-initiated World Solar Summit Process (WSSP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission will advise the summit on the best possible strategies to popularize the worldwide development and utilisation of renewable energies.  The future role of the commission will be decided by the summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WSSP was launched in 1993 in partnership with the EU and the International Atomic Energy Agency to create an awareness of the need to switch from conventional methods of energy to use of renewable energy technology.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, SenegaL (PANA) - At the Atlanta Olympics, Namibia's Frankie Fredericks, African record<BR>holder for the 100m and 200m, will certainly be a major threat to European and American sprinters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since early June, at four meets -- in Saint-Denis and Villeneuve D'Asq (France), Helsinki (Finland) and Lausanne (Switzerland) -- he has run the 100m in under 10 seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On July 3, Fredericks set a new African record, clocking 9.86 seconds in the race, beating the former record of 9.94 seconds, set by the Nigerian Davidson Ezinwa. His time was a hundredth of a second behind the American Leroy Burrell's world record of 9.85 seconds.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After finishing second best, for a few years, in the sprint, the Namibian ace's motto at Atlanta will be: &quot;gold, nothing but gold&quot;. The question is whether he can do a double and win gold in both the 100m and 200m events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is now certain that he will run the 200m, in which he beat world record holder, Michael Johnson (19.66) on July 5, in Oslo, Norway, clocking 19.82 seconds. This was the American star's first defeat in 21 races.  Fredericks also set a new African record, beating the three-year-old record of 19.85 in the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fredericks is one of Namibia's top sports ambassadors and his career is closely linked to the history of his country. After Namibia's independence, Frankie Fredericks left football for athletics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thanks to a grant from the Uranium company for which his father works, he had the opportunity to attend Brigham Young University in Utah, United States. There, while preparing for a Master's degree in Business and Administration (MBA), he rubbed shoulders with future American stars in college athletics competitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In August 1991, the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) admitted the Namibian National Federation, a few days before the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, Japan. This enabled Fredericks to participate in the competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He finished 5th in the 100m final, setting an African record (9.97 secs) and gave his country its first medal in a world competition by winning silver in the 200m. It was also the first African medal in the sprint at a world competition since 1964, when Senegal's Abdou Seye, running under French colors, won the bronze medal in the 200m at the Tokyo Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1968, Jean Louis Ravelomanantsoa of Madagascar made it to the final but failed to win a medal in the 100m at the Mexico Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the Barcelona Olympics of 1992, Fredericks won two silver medals (100 and 200m), Namibia's first medals in Olympic history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the 1993 world championships in Stuttgart, Germany, the Namibian athlete won gold in the 200m and set a new African record (19.68). Two years later, at the world championships in Goteburg, Sweden, he failed to repeat his feat but managed a silver in the same race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In five years, Fredericks has won one gold medal and four silver medals at world championships and Olympics, a clear testimony of his talent as a sprinter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Atlanta, the Namibian athlete is expected to live up to his reputation, especially with his recent winning streak in the 100 and 200m races. This should give him a psychological edge over his greatest rivals.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Unions have urged government officials to abandon their ambivalent attitude to the crisis in the country and put an end to the continuing massacres.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - Mozambique will have an estimated 18.027 million people by the end<BR>of 1996, with an annual growth rate of 2.7 percent, Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi said Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at a ceremony to mark World Population Day, he said that this meant that there are 600,000 more people in the country than in 1995.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The birth rate in Mozambique was 6.4 in 1995, while infant mortality rate stood at 128 per thousand. There was also a dependency rate of 93. This means that every 100 members of the economically active population have to guarantee the subsistence of 93 people who are not of working age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The youthful structure of the Mozambican population means that the government faces a major challenge of creating jobs and planning social services, which calls for large scale investments,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This year's celebration of the World Population Day coincides with the preparations for a general population census of Mozambique, due to take place in 1997.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the formulation of a national population policy, he said, the conclusions of the international conference on population and development, held in 1994 in Cairo, would be taken into account.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mozambique's population policy, he said, would focus on the harmonization of demographic trends with the country's economic growth.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - Massive imports of South African frozen chickens are ruining the Mozambican poultry industry by undercutting local prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a report in Friday's issue of the independent news sheet &quot;Mediafax&quot;, the South African chickens sell at 26,000 meticais (about 2.3 U.S dollars), while the Mozambican ones cost between 28,000 and 30,000 meticais a kilo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Worried by the competition, the Mozambican Association of Poultry Producers (AVIACA) has written a strong protest letter to the minister of industry, energy, and tourism, Oldemiro Baloi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The association pointed out that the poultry industry is one of the few sectors of the Mozambican economy that grew massively over the past decade -- and with very little support from the country's banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the mid-1980s almost all chickens consumed in Mozambique were imported. Since then, local poultry producers have rehabilitated existing poultry farms and built new ones, helping the country's move towards self sufficiency in chickens and eggs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They invested in incubators, slaughterhouses, freezers, laboratories, and transport. In 1995, AVIACA members produced 6,000 tons of chicken, 800,000 dozens of eggs, and 15,000 tons of chicken feed. Since many producers have not yet joined the recently formed AVIACA, the real figures would be much higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Poultry production generated 1,800 jobs in 1995, says AVIACA, and provides employment for 10,000 peasant and co-operative chicken breeders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1995, poultry production generated three billion meticais (about 263,000 U.S dollars) in taxes for the state budget. It also saved the country 20 million dollars that would otherwise have been spent in importing chickens and eggs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The poultry producers told the minister that all this is now under threat from the South African imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Not only is a considerable proportion of the imported chickens totally illegal, but in general the licensed importers bring in more than they declare,&quot; noted the AVIACA in its letter to the minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The smuggling and consequent evasion of import duties mean that the state receives less from the imports than from the local produce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The importers, seeking to maximize their profits, acquire produce whose low prices derive from years of being frozen, or from contamination, or from being stuffed full of hormones and antibiotics, which would bar them from access to more demanding markets,&quot; AVIACA's letter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are not calling for a ban on imports of frozen chickens but we do argue that imports should complement national production, and should obey mechanisms of quality control that safeguard the consumers' health and accord with notions of fair competition,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Importers of the South African chickens use various tricks to get round imports and customs regulations. In particular, they exploit a loophole whereby imports valued at less than 500 dollars do not need an import licence. So the pirate importers make several imports per day, all valued at less than 500 dollars, the association said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KAMPALA, Uganda (PANA) - The multi-national Coca Cola, has announced here that it will invest 30<BR>million U.S dollars in two new bottling lines in Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The first bottling line in Mbarara (south western Uganda) will be operational in April 1997.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other, a modern giant factory in Namanve, 18 kilometers (about 12 miles) east of Kampala, will be ready by the end of the year,&quot; said Majid Bagalaaliwo, a local Coca Cola representative in Uganda, Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bagalaaliwo, who is chairman of Century Bottling Plant, made the announcement in a news release at the end of a visit by Carl Ware, Senior Coca Cola vice-president and head of its operations in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ware presented his company's investment plans to President Yoweri Museveni on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The major share holders in Century are the Bagalaaliwo family and Coca-Cola SABCO, a South African company whose headquarters is in Port Elizabeth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Century Bottling Company produces four million crates of soft drinks annually and pays the government one million dollars monthly in taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bagalaaliwo said the company has already acquired 20 acres of land in Mbarara. Negotiations for the acquisition of another 30 acres in Namanve, have almost been concluded, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coca Cola will also modernize existing distribution and marketing infrastructure, which will be expanded country wide. &quot;I am sure you can anticipate the economic spin-off which investment of this magnitude will have on the economy and on the people of Uganda,&quot; said Butch Moldenhauer, Century's Managing Director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are excited about the future of the Coca-Cola business in Uganda and we are committed to the success of our projects within this country,&quot; Moldenhauer added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - Boutros-Ghali's bid for re-election as United Nations secretary-general, the summit of the Organisation of African Unity, elections in Niger and the establishment of Sierra Leone's Truth Commission, were among the leading issues discussed in the African press this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Boutros-Ghali's announcement seeking a second five-year term awakened the hostility of the United States government. The Lagos newspaper, Daily Times, said that while the U.S. claimed that its hostility was motivated by a desire to see a more efficient U.N. system, &quot;the real reason behind Washington's moves may be nothing but sheer domestic politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said: &quot;It is no longer a secret that over the years, right wing elements in the United States have turned the world body into a favorite sport to be punched and vilified at every opportunity.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consequently, it said, &quot;In a re-election bid that is already badly tainted by Whitewater, Paula Jones and Filegate, Mr. Clinton has chosen to vote against Boutros-Ghali perhaps to deny his republican opponents an opportunity to attack his foreign policy. But he went too far.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trimming the U.N. bureaucracy, democratizing its Security Council, reducing the size of the U.S. contribution to the world body, it said, were all badly needed changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Reforms of this magnitude, some observers have pointed out, go well beyond the purview of the secretary-general; it is an issue which the member states themselves must pursue vigorously,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Be that as it may, Africans must stand solidly behind Dr. Boutros-Ghali in his re-election campaign because as the first African to occupy that position, the secretary-general has acquitted himself quite well,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was called upon to occupy that position &quot;at a crucial but difficult moment&quot; in international relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It noted that with the end of the cold war, there was a dramatic shift of world attention, to the countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In spite of this, Boutros-Ghali ensured that Africa was not marginalized within the U.N. system,&quot; it said. &quot;He supported peace-keeping operations in Angola, Mozambique, Liberia and Somalia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier this year, it noted, he launched a special 25 billion U.S.-dollar initiative for the development of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These factors, and the fact that past occupants of the world's highest public office have always had a second term, compel us to urge Africa to rally solidly behind Dr. Boutros-Ghali, to ensure that he is not denied a second term which is rightly his.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Furthermore, Boutros-Ghali's second term would afford him the opportunity to realize the democratization of the permanent membership of the Security Council, which the big boys have hitherto monopolized to the exclusion of large sections of the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The membership of the Security Council indeed poses the biggest paradox of our time, namely, that those who are weeping louder than the bereaved, calling for democracy in other countries, cannot see the need to democratize the U.N. to ensure that all the free nations of the world conduct their affairs in an atmosphere devoid of bullying and condescending inequality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cotonou's Le Citoyen (The Citizen) and The Monitor, of Addis Ababa, agreed with the Daily Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Le Citoyen, a Beninese publication, commented on the endorsement given the Egyptian diplomat by the Organisation of African Unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In fact, Africa has no reproach against Boutros Boutros-Ghali and his (first term) has been positive,&quot; Le Citoyen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Mr Boutros-Ghali's major handicap is American hostility or, rather, Israeli hostility expressed through Bill Clinton, the U.S. president, who will be seeking a second term in office at the end of this year,&quot; it said.  &quot;In effect, Boutros-Ghali has become persona non grata (in the United States) because of his policy in the Near-East.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Monitor noted U.S. assurances that it would not oppose the election of another African as secretary general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Although this is a good diplomatic compromise, Africans should not entirely leave the choice to be guided by the tastes of the United States.  They will have to make their own independent choice and coordinate their diplomatic activities to this end, with other developing countries,&quot; the newspaper said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There are, of course, a lot of educated and talented African diplomats that can fill Boutros-Ghali's shoes. Whether they are endorsing the re-election of Boutros Ghali' or any other African candidate, they will have to close ranks as they have recently done at the Yaounde Summit and (work) for the best interests of Africa,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;By its style of debate, its decisions, the bold affirmation of pride in being African, Yaounde '96 &quot;presented for the O.A.U. an era of concrete resolutions,&quot; The official Cameroon Tribune said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Le Quotidien, Cameroon's first privately-owned daily, said it wished the resolutions will not end up as unimplemented &quot;pious wishes&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> La Nouvelle Expression, another Yaounde newspaper, saw the conference as a mere formality especially, it said, as there were no resolutions nor concrete decisions on conflicts such as those in Burundi, Somalia and Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dakar's Sud Quotidien thinks the meeting was so mundane that it suggests it be held every two years, rather than annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Even the Islamic Conference Organisation, which is better funded than the O.A.U., meets every two years,&quot; it noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Niger, Gen. Ibrahim Mainassara Bare's dissolution of the country's independent electoral commission, in the middle of voting, and his arrest of opposition politicians came under vicious attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These acts, Cotonou-based Le Citoyen said, were motivated by his worry that his rivals would band together in opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He has thus vitiated the electoral process, creating a situation that some describe as a second coup, even though he denies it,&quot; the paper said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What credibility can be given to a ballot at which votes are said to have been counted by soldiers or under tight military surveillance?&quot; said the Benin government daily, La Nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;After the military coup of last January, an electoral coup has now been staged,&quot; the Cotonou newspaper said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dakar's Le Soleil said that after his January takeover, Gen. Bare had all the tools needed to put the democratic process back on track. But to complete this mission, it added, he had to hold credible elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;To do so, the Independent Electoral Commission, though not the ideal solution, gave a certain guarantee of fairness. Its dissolution in the middle of vote counting and its replacement by a body exclusively comprising senior officials chosen by the military junta, raises strong suspicion on the credibility of the results announced after the election,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Daily Champion, another private newspaper published in Lagos, described as &quot;timely, welcome and commendable,&quot; the establishment by the Sierra Leonean government of a National Unity and Reconciliation Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new civilian administration in Freetown set up the body to investigate the atrocities of the country's past military administration. The idea is to right whatever wrongs may have been committed by individuals or groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If the commission carries out its onerous and historical assignment with the requisite objectively, candor and fairness, there is no doubt that the exercise will go a long way in removing sources of conflict in Sierra Leone,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - South African Speaker of parliament, Frene<BR>Ginwala, said on Wednesday the withdrawal of the National Party from the government of national unity will strengthen the country's opposition in the national assembly and enhance democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ginwala, who is heading a seven-member South African parliamentary delegation on a five-day visit here, was speaking to reporters after meeting her Zimbabwean counterpart, Cyril Ndebele.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said the level of debate in the South African parliament was as good as in any country in the world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have dull and sometimes very fiery debates, just like anywhere else, including Zimbabwe,&quot; said Ginwala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There will, however, be a significant shift in August this year when our parliament re-opens. The opposition will be significantly larger with the addition of one more larger party, the National Party. We anticipate more vibrant and challenging debates,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ginwala said the National Party's withdrawal would not only enhance democracy, but had also resulted in an increase in the number of opposition parliamentarians from less than 10 to well over 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Party of former Second Deputy President, Frederick de Klerk, pulled out of the government of national unity in June, claiming that the African National Congress (ANC) had refused to extend the current power-sharing arrangement beyond 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ginwala said South Africa was still trying to further democratize the process and institution of parliament, adding that the transformation would be through specific experiences and examples from others around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ginwala said the visit to Zimbabwe was part of efforts to cement relations between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are engaged in a crusade of parliamentary reforms and draw a lot of inspiration from Zimbabwe, not only because we are neighbors, but also because we inherited a similar and common situation at independence,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South African delegation includes members of the majority parliamentary party -- Nelson Mandela's ANC, the Pan-Africanist Congress, National Party, Inkhatha Freedom Party and the Freedom Front.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The seven, six boxers and one athlete, are part of Zambia's 12-person contingent to the July 19 to August 4 Olympics.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other five athletes, based in the United States, will join the team in Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Frederick Chiluba on Saturday, bailed out the team with a donation of 20,000 U.S dollars covering part of its travel expenses. The gift was in addition to other private donations and monies obtained from fund raising events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There had been fears the team would fail to travel due to lack of funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia's Olympic team comprises former world and current Commonwealth 400 meters hurdles champion Samuel Matete who is based in the United States.  He is the country's major hope for a medal at the games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others are Godfrey Siamusiye, a 3,000 meters steeplechase specialist and Charles Mulinga (5,000m), Clinton Bufuku (200m) and Fackson Nkandu (5,000m).  The only female on the team is the runner Ngozi Mwanamwambwa. She does the 200m and 400m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The six boxers who left Tuesday with runner Nkandu are: Boniface Mukuka (flyweight), Oscar Chongo (bantamweight), Dave Mwale (light flyweight), Dennis Zimba (lightweight), Victor Kasote (flyweight), and Chris Mpande a featherweight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The boxers returned to Lusaka recently from a six-week training stint at a South African army barracks in Blomfontein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They were briefly camped in the midlands town of Kabwe by a local boxing promoter before departure.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PRETORIA, South Africa (PANA) - A 40-year-old Nigerian doctoral student at the University of Pretoria, Anthony Afolayan, has found a cure for a peculiar disease among the white population in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Afolayan, once a botany lecturer at the University of Ilorin, in south-western Nigeria, was able to resolve the riddle behind Herpes Simplex by extracting an active ingredient from a local herb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Herpes Simplex is a disease that causes blisters and cracks, usually on the lips.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Afolayan's doctoral dissertation was based on research on the medicinal potential of a local flowering plant called Helichrysum. The plant was found to be active against bacteria, fungi and viruses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An extract from the plant was successfully used in treating about 100 cases of herpes among students and lecturers at the university in conjunction with a local hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following the publication of the breakthrough in international medical and scientific journals, many pharmaceutical companies are trooping to Pretoria to strike a deal for marketing the product.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An enthusiastic Afolayan told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that he had been bombarded with offers of job across the globe. But he was likely to remain in South Africa to continue research on the other cures available from the plant, the researcher said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The plant, which is found only in South Africa's Kwazulu- Natal province and parts of Lesotho, has for ages been used by the Zulus for treating headaches, bronchitis and other ailments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Afolayan's supervisor, John Meyer, told NAN that the university was very proud of his findings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It has brought the university to the limelight and the potential for a lot of international collaboration, &quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meyer said medication currently on the market for herpes which have not been as effective, cost more than 40 rands (about 10 U.S. dollars) per dose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The new discovery would go a long way in curing a disease that has afflicted Europeans for ages without cure,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NIAMEY, Niger (PANA) - The Niger Workers Trade Union Federation has called for an indefinite strike, starting Thursday, to protest against the conduct of presidential elections Sunday and Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The unions and the opposition parties claimed Gen. Bare Mainassara dissolved the independent electoral commission after preliminary results showed he was losing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The results, announced by a hastily-appointed electoral commission, showed the military ruler, Ibrahim Mainassara Barre had won 52.20 percent of the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The results mean there will be no run-off election. The strike was called in Niamey, Tuesday, at the end of an extraordinary congress of all trade unions, including those which are not affiliated to the Federation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government has tried to stop the strike by issuing a statement appealing to &quot;the workers' sense of responsibility and judgment&quot;, while acknowledging their &quot;right to industrial action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The strike will coincide with a call from the opposition parties protesting the results, to turn Niamey, the capital, and other towns into &quot;dead cities&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political analysts in Niamey said the situation in Niger would be tense in the coming days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were reports that some presidential candidates in the elections had been put under house arrest while others had sought refuge in foreign missions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other presidential candidates were Mamadou Tanja, former president Mahamane Ousmane, Moumouni Adamou Djermakoye and Mahamadou Issoufou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mainassara seized power in a military coup on January 27.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - Confidence in the South African business sector turned around in June, showing its first improvement after six successive months of decline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The June business confidence index of the South African Chamber of Business (SACOB), released Tuesday, shows a rise of two percentage points to a level of 118.9.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main factor behind the increase in business confidence was the announcement last month of the South African government's macro-economic strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The business mood has largely improved,&quot; said SACOB chief economist, Ben Van Rensburg, &quot;because the government has come forward with a specific view on how to take the country forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The strategy,&quot; he added, &quot;provides a framework which should make it possible for South Africa to achieve the targets generally regarded as the minimum which the country must attain if it is to negotiate itself out of the poverty trap in which it currently finds itself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South African government plan aims to create 500,000 jobs a year and boost economic growth to 6.0 percent by the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other positive developments which have boosted business confidence in South Africa, include the reversal of an increase in interest rates by the country's banks and a return to relative stability in the foreign exchange markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another positive factor was the holding of peaceful local government elections in Kwazulu-Natal province two weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SACOB Director-General, Raymond Parsons, says economic activity is levelling off, and adds: &quot;fast implementation and monitoring of the economic strategy could see the country reach growth of five to six percent by the year 2000.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> YAOUNDE, Cameroon (PANA) - The Organisation of Africa Unity summit in Yaounde, Cameroon, decided Tuesday that the 1997 summit will be held in Harare, Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African leaders also confirmed that the 1998 meeting will be in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso and the following year in Algiers, Algeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a press conference Tuesday, OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said &quot;this shows we have perfected the art of planning.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is customary for the president of the country hosting the summit to assume the leadership of the 53-nation body, a prestigious position than can reap political benefits for the incumbent, at home and abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The summit went into protracted discussions late Tuesday, during which the leaders resolved, among other issues, gave a six-month moratorium on debtor countries to pay at least 30 percent of their arrears of contributions to the body by the end of July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As at June 1, arrears owed to the organization amounted to 53 million U.S dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The leaders also urged the government, leadership and armed forces of Burundi to demonstrate greater political will for a negotiated and peaceful settlement of the conflict currently raging in that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burundi has seen over 150,000 people massacred in three years of ethnic clashes between the majority Hutu and minority Tutsi groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least, 30 African leaders attended the summit, which also urged the international community to provide increased material and financial assistance to countries hosting Liberian refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some 800,000 Liberian refugees have fled the country during the six-year old civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an unprecedented move, children from parts of the continent addressed the summit on the suffering of their colleagues in conflict-ridden states.  Some 60 children from 12 African countries embroiled in different kinds of wars attended the summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The children called for the imposition of sanctions on all countries that violated children's rights and appealed for an immediate end to the production of anti-personnel land mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African leaders also endorsed United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's bid for a second five-year term in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Boutros-Ghali has, however, fallen out of favour with the United States, which is now lobbying for an alternative African candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Saudi newspaper quoted the head of the Organisation of Islamic Conference, Hamid Algabid of Niger, as saying he would seek the U.N. post if it fell vacant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A spokesman for the OAU Secretary-General, Salim Ahmed Salim, said on Tuesday the Tanzanian was not interested in the job.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> YAOUNDE, Cameroon (PANA) - Nigerian Foreign Minister, Tom Ikimi, told the assembly of African leaders meeting Tuesday in Yaounde, Cameroon, that Gen. Sani Abacha had made plans to attend the summit but was unable to come at the 11th hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Local radio had reported that Abacha was expected in the Cameroonian capital on Sunday, for the summit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's true that all expected the Nigeria leader to come, but I don't have any further explanation beyond what the Nigerian foreign minister said,&quot; OAU Secretary-General, Salim Ahmed Salim, said Tuesday at a press conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the fact that the territorial dispute between Nigeria and Cameroon, over ownership of the Bakassi Peninsula, was not on the summit's agenda, should not be viewed ominously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dispute has been referred to the International Court of Justice at the Hague and the Togolese President, Gnassingbe Eyadema, has been mediating between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have also been involved as the secretary-general of the OAU in discussions with both Nigeria and Cameroon,&quot; Salim said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The fact that the item is not on the agenda should not give the wrong impression. What is important is that both parties should avoid any acts of violence,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dispute over the oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula has at times flared into skirmishes. This week, Nigeria accused Cameroon of massing troops in the disputed territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abacha's absence in Yaounde almost certainly means there will be no discussion of the dispute at the summit, something President Biya had made clear he wanted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Salim said the summit is one of the best attended, with 31 heads of state in attendance. The forum will end on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AI Zambia women co-ordinator, Margaret Mbuluku said her organisation was greatly concerned and alarmed by recent police revelations that the numbers of women dying violent deaths in domestic settings were on the increase.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Mbuluku said various NGOs especially those working with women should intensify efforts to educate women on their rights, even in marriage and how these could be upheld by the individuals concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Battered women should be encouraged to report their assailants to the police even if these were their husbands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Mbuluku said traditionists like Mr. Pardon Katongo who encouraged wife battering all in the name of love should be condemned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''We strongly feel that love is not beating, but embraces peace,'' Ms Mbuluku said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police force public relations officer, Francis Musonda, revealed earlier in the week that 84 women died from acts of violence countrywide between 1994-95.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Musonda said violence against women was still prevalent in Zambia and appealed to the public not to hide cases of violence so that culprits could be brought to book.</SPAN></P>

Miyanda said the political situation in the country is very stable contrary to some reports.</SPAN></P>

ZCCM was linked through its relationship with Global Minerals and Metals which is being investigated by the New York authorities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A metal trader, Yasuo Hamanaka, working for Sumitomo Corporation, is believed to have influenced copper prices on the London Metal Exchange to the extent that he held sway over the prices on the entire market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> British, American and Japanese investigators are now investigating how this became possible and want to bring out all who were connected with his operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But ZCCM director of corporate planning and corporate affairs, Pius Mambo, said in a telephone interview from Kalulushi yesterday that none of the investigating agencies had so far approached ZCCM over the trader's dealings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are very surprised at the British press reports and sent a protest letter to The Guardian newspaper in London which was published. We'll also be getting in touch with The Post over a story published concerning the same issue. It is not correct that we are involved in shady dealings,&quot; said Mambo.  &quot;No official has approached us and we are not aware of any investigation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Minister of Mines Keli Walubita in an interview yesterday maintained government was studying the situation and would issue a report at the appropriate time, but he declined to reveal what form the 'investigations' would take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hamanaka, known as &quot;Mr Copper&quot;, was alleged to have held back substantial stocks of physical copper in collaboration with some copper producers for the purpose of manipulating price levels on the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some financial lawyers involved in a law suit against Sumitomo said these stocks far exceeded the company's needs. But this put Hamanaka in a position to make massive profits on the futures market.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Nikuv Computers (Israel) Limited, the company updating the voters register, has discounted fears of double registers in the forthcoming general elections.  Speaking in an interview on Saturday Nikuv Computers projects manager, Gershon Korda, said such a possibility did not exist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I cannot see that happening especially when one has already been given his voter's card,&quot; Korda said. &quot;At least our company cannot do that.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But chairman of the opposition UNIP retired General Malimba Masheke said both government and Nikuv Computers cannot be trusted over the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Everything was arranged in a secret manner,&quot; General Masheke said in an interview yesterday. &quot;It is this secrecy which shows that the two were up to no good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Masheke also said that the register prepared by Nikuv Computers &quot;would not be used because it was a dead issue&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are not going to use Nikuv register.We have nothing to do with the company because the issue is dead,&quot; Masheke said. &quot;We have to use NRCs or re-register afresh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Party also said Korda's assurance cannot be trusted because his contract is with a small clique in Zambia. National Party secretary general Akashambatwa Mbikusita-Lewanika said in an interview yesterday that the only assurance must come through discussion by all stakeholders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The people of Zambia have no relationship with Korda and Nikuv. Worse still Vice-President Godfrey Miyanda is on record as saying he did not have any knowledge of some aspects of the Nikuv agreement,&quot; Lewanika said, adding: &quot;This was one of the items at the meeting where the MMD walked out and we are still waiting for them to return when they get responsible enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Korda also said that his company only used information it was given by the elections office and nothing else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We do not invent data,&quot; Korda said. &quot;Whatever is done comes from the elections office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Korda revealed that the provisional registers which were printed in Zambia at the Mulungushi conference centre, were now ready and would be handed to the elections office this week. He also revealed that some voters cards, which provide for three presidential elections and parliamentary elections and by-elections, three local government elections and by-elections, had already arrived in South Africa from the printers in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They will be collected at the airport by the elections office and brought to us before we hand them back,&quot; Korda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Korda, Nikuv will soon establish a National Information Centre at the elections office with twenty computers, twenty in-coming lines, twenty operators and some printers. It will also provide all the register data to the office which will make it possible for people outside Lusaka to phone in to check whether their names are on the register or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The data belongs to the Zambian government that is why as far as possible everything was done here,&quot; Korda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He denied the accusation reported in the press that his sister company in Zimbabwe had messed up the voters register there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Mistakes in Zimbabwe were minor and we corrected them. No-one has paid any extra money for the correction,&quot; Korda said, adding that the company in Zimbabwe where it has operated for more than a year now, was legally registered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are not registered in Zambia,&quot; Korda admitted alluding to the fact that the company was not intending to do so.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The lack of long and medium-term financing in the country has hindered small scale business expansion forcing some entrepreneurs to start crossing borders in a bid to source financing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And it was the lack of such facilities that had led to the slow growth of the small scale business sector, explained Investment Centre director general, Bwalya Ng'andu, at an investment financing seminar in Lusaka yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What you will only find being offered by the banks in the country are short-term loans and over-draft facilities while what the businesses are looking for are accessible long term financing facilities,&quot; Ng'andu said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The one day seminar was intended to provide information on the sources of finances and also enlighten participants, drawn from the country's business community, on good project creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ng'andu said this was why his organisation had taken up a role of linking up prospective borrowers with financiers to enhance growth in medium and small scale businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our role is to show the people where they can source funding for their business expansion and investment,&quot; Ngandu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the lending institutions which gave presentations on their operations and access to finances were the World Banks, International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Africa Project Development Facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And speaking in an interview IFC's Zimbabwe based senior investment officer, Philip Condon, disclosed that economic and political stability was his organisations key consideration before providing finances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are not a political institution but we consider the political climate in any country. We are not ready to invest in war torn places but for small incidents encountered in elections we just go ahead in financing,&quot; Condon said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A total of five companies have benefited from IFC's facilities over the last 10 years with the latest beneficiary being Big Five Car hire with almost US $600,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IFC, has through its recently launched Africa Enterprise Fund, been financially supportive to viable small and medium scale businesses with investment of US$250,000 up to US$5 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IFC funding covers 40 per cent of the whole cost of the investment project.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - President Frederick Chiluba will next month dissolve Parliament and announce the date for presidential and general elections, State House sources disclosed yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According the sources, the President will dissolve Parliament either at the end of August or in the first week of September and call for a snap election to be held within two to three weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Minister of Labour and Social Services and MMD chief whip Newstead Zimba pleaded ignorance of the forthcoming dissolution of Parliament or the announcement of the elections date.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have been on leave since July 1. I don't know about when Parliament resumes or will be dissolved. I also don't know about the elections because I am on leave,&quot; Zimba said in an interview yesterday, advising: &quot;You must ignore some of these things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the State House sources' information is confirmed by the programme drawn by the Elections Office which starts this Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The programme which starts with the briefing of registration and elections officers in various provinces ends with the distribution of registers and election equipment by the director of elections, Rabson Mwansa, on September 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Elections Office assistant director, Joel Sikazwe, declined to be drawn into the matter claiming that announcing the date of elections is the prerogative of the President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Sikazwe could not say why the programme of activities of the elections office appears to confirm the State House information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We wanted to get set but you can conclude what you want,&quot; Sikazwe said.  &quot;I haven't said yes. The programme is to enable us and our field staff to get ready.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But three opposition parties said they are ready for the elections if the playing field is levelled and the register is right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are ready for an election,&quot; said UNIP chairman retired General Malimba Masheke, &quot;but we are not ready for an election which is going to be rigged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Masheke complained of lack of access to the media and the non existence of an independent electoral commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have no access to the media - both print and electronic,&quot; General Masheke carped. &quot; No independent electoral commission which can lay the ground for free and fair elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia Democratic Congress vice-president, Kasuka Mutukwa, said while his party was ready for elections the present situation was suspect From Front Page</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are ready for an election but before any election is held it is absolutely necessary for the election machinery to be known to all stakeholders and the voters,&quot; Mutukwa said. &quot;We are ready but we can only take part when we know that the playing field is level. It is like playing football.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And National Party vice-secretary for elections Benson Mpundu also said his party was ready for the elections but wondered why government wanted to spend money on the Mongu by-election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are ready for elections and elections can be called anytime. But why should we go to the Mongu by-election?,&quot; Mpundu asked. &quot;There must be a motive to that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But President Chiluba last month warned opposition parties to brace themselves for the elections and advised those who were not ready to try their luck after five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This country must move forward and must never remain stagnant as it was in the UNIP era,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added that time for the election was the time of reckoning when political parties had to go back to the people to seek a fresh mandate and those parties which had not done much for the people should count themselves out of the race.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Zambia has dropped one point on the world soccer rankings from the number fifteen slot to position sixteen but she remains Africa's top side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the latest FIFA rankings released on July 3, 1996, and made available to The Post yesterday by Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) acting general secretary Julio Chiluba, South Africa has moved two places behind Zambia at position eighteen, while Argentina has moved to the number fifteen position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Chiluba has attributed Zambia's new position to the latest edition of the European Cup.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think the dropping is because a lot of European teams recently featured in the European Cup,&quot; said Chiluba yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brazil, the 1994 World Cup winners still maintain the top slot while the newly crowned European champions, Germany are second placed. France , the Czech Republic, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden follow in that order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia's opponents in the World Cup Group C, Zaire are ranked 58 with Congo, taking up the number 103 position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria, the 1994 Africa Cup champions, are surprisingly ranked 47th with Zimbabwe on number 66.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The next rankings will be made on August 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the BP top eight competition starts this month with the first matches set for Woodlands Stadium and Kitwe's Arthur Davies Stadium but the draws will be made on July 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Julio Chiluba, yesterday announced the quarter-finals that will involve Mufulira Wanderers, Power Dynamos, Kabwe Warriors, Zamsure, City of Lusaka, Lusaka Dynamos, Roan United and Konkola Blades, will start on July 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The semi-finals will be played on August 11 at Woodlands Stadium and Nkana Stadium while the finals will be staged at Lusaka's Independence Stadium on August 31.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Atlanta - If Zambia has any hopes of winning a medal at this year's Olympic Summer Games in Atlanta, they must be in Samuel Matete's shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And if Samuel Matete has any hope of having Olympic jewelry around his neck, this is his year to do it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the Games begin this Friday with an elaborate ceremony, the spotlight on Africa and indeed Zambia will be in the track and field events which many people see as the very essence of the Games-pure athleticism.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Forget boxing medals, it will be tough to beat American boxers at their home turf, that's if Zambian boxers don't slammed by Cuban boxers who are hot favorite to win most of the boxing medals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So, it will be in the Olympic Stadium with its 85,000 capacity that the cream of Africa and Zambian will be showcased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Matete has shown he is serious he is about winning the Olympic medal that eluded four years ago in Barcelona, thanks for questionable call. In the last four weeks, Matete has - literally - being running from one race to another and chalking up impressive wins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just in the last two weeks, he ran in the Nikaia Grand Prix track meet in Nice France on Wednesday, just after participating in the Salamanca trace meet in Spain, the Athletissima Grand Prix in Lausanne Switzerland and the Gaz de France Grand Prix meet in France in a space of ten days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Switzerland, Matete won the 400 hurdles in 47.85 beating American Olympic trials winner, Bryan Bronson, second in 48.06.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Spain, he ran 49.01 beating Yoshihiko Saito of Japan, 49.33., and Ashraf Saber of Italy, 49.66.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the Gaz de France meet, Matete barely lost to Derrick Adkins of US who ran 47.70 compared to Matete's 48.06. While the NiKaia Grand Prix, Matete was nicked at the tape by Torrance Zellner of United States in 48.24 while Matete clocked at 48.27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like one sports reporter noted: If Matete fails to win a medal this year, he is history as far as the Olympics are concerned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Silwamba arguing in the case where Sakala is facing contempt charges before magistrate Brian Simango, said the subordinate court has no jurisdiction to hear contempt cases that were committed outside their perception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The procedure for contempt is very clear, where contempts are committed outside the (subordinate) court, the only court competent to hear such proceedings is the High Court which has unlimited original jurisdiction,&quot; Silwamba said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Silwamba was replying to an application by lawyer Sakwiba Sikota that Sakala be committed for contempt and that common law be used in these proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sakala is alleged to have on March 26, this year approached Patrick Mutale from Zambia Daily Mail, an accused person in the main case of theft of newsprint, to include Post Newspaper managing director, Fred M'membe to become the principle accused person. He was then sued for contempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sikota countered Silwamba's argument saying the whole concept of power to punish for contempt is based on the notion that the courts must be given their dignity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sikota said it was also to insure that individuals no matter how powerful or well placed do not pervert the course of justice or that the individual no matter how weak is not intimidated or trampled upon by those who have an influence on state machinery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our motivation for commencing these proceedings is to ensure that they are protected by the Judicial system against those whose desire is to subvert the judicial process which is the cornerstone of modern, civilised society,&quot; Sikota said. &quot;We therefore are comfortable with this court proceeding by way of this application to protect the parties to this action by hearing this matter or in the alternative if the other side is more comfortable with this court referring the matter for trial before the High Court, to do so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sikota said the defence was comfortable to swim in any stream of justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Silwamba said Sikota's submission was immoral saying there was no choice in courts of law as to which procedure to follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Silwamba said in morality, one can choose a stream but at law, you can't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Magistrate Simango adjourned the matter to August 6 for ruling and August 7 for the main case of theft of newsprint in which Mutale is charged with Post Finance manager, Patrick Musengwa, and Daily Mail's James Nkhoma, Grevasius Mayenga and Frederick Mumba.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - A mysterious fire yesterday gutted the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) Mufulira Division smelter furnace causing extensive damage which will cost millions of United States dollars to repair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Industrial relations officer, Kelvin Imasiku, confirmed the incident.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the fire caused extensive damage to the automatic furnace between 16:00 and 17:30 hours yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I can only confirm that there was a blazing inferno which gutted the furnace around 16:00 hours,&quot; Imasiku said in an interview in Mufulira yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Imasiku said that the damage would definitely affect the production of copper cathodes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police in Mufulira confirmed the incident but declined to give details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some ZCCM fire fighters talked to at the scene said it took them more than one and half hours to put out the fire. They had to call in for a reinforcement of more fire engines from Kitwe's Nkana Division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some smelter staff talked to expressed concern and worry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If the damage is very extensive it is a big blow to the mining conglomerate and it would cost them dearly to resume the normal copper cathodes production,&quot; a smelter staff member who declined to be named said in an interview in Mufulira yesterday. &quot;This automatic furnace is very expensive to maintain. The company spends millions of kwacha to have it overhauled and they have to hire experts from South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another ZCCM senior staff member at the gutted smelter said this would greatly hamper copper production in Zambia because the other smelter at Nkana division was small and ineffective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Imasiku declined to comment on whether or not any lives had been lost and referred all enquiries to ZCCM spokesman Francis Musonda.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theweek (Lagos) July 15, 1996 by Jaiyeola Ajasa</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - The fireworks will climb to the sky and spit beautiful colours to brighten up the night. The southern metropolis of Atlanta will play host to 197 nations. Ten thousand athletes from all over the world will gather for the Centennial Olympic Games. Mankinds' greatest sporting event will once again command the attention of the whole world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There will be tears for victory, tears for defeat and tears for participating - the ultimate Olympic prize. The Nigerian athletes and officials that were expected to fly out to Atlanta last weekend will join their counterparts from all over the world. For the 87 athletes that will be adorning the nation's green-white-green colours, the daunting task will be to re-launch the country's 44-year campaign for the Olympic gold. Since the country's first outing at the Helsinki Games in Finland, the lovely yellow medal that has made heroes out of many has proved elusive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Going by preparations for this year's Olympics, which have been haphazard to say the least, the country's contingent to Atlanta needs luck if it is to equal the Barcelona Games record. In Spain in 1992, the country recorded its best ever Olympics outing. Although the gold gates were again shut, the contingent returned from the games with three silver and a bronze medal. Events leading up to the country's participation in the Atlanta do not give hope for the kind of impressive outing needed to strike gold.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In athletics, which is the prime sport of the Olympic Games, the athletes that will be representing the nation will carry a heavier burden as the country's main hope for the elusive gold. The 100 metres dash will see Nigeria's best Davidson Ezinwa lining up against athletes like Frankie &quot;the flash&quot; Fredricks, who has been in top form lately, running a world best time of 9.86 secs in Laussane, Switzerland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others that will compete against Ezinwa are Olympic defending champion Linford Christie, whose time of 10.04 secs during the British trials puts him in contention for the gold. World champion Donovan Bailey, who last week defeated Christie in Nice, France, winning with a time of 10.17 secs is another gold medal prospect. The Canadian, however, has a personal best time of 9.93 secs. Also to give Ezinwa stiff competition are world record holder Dennis Mitchell and his American counterpart Leroy Burell and another Canadian, Bruno Surin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Against these top competitors, only an incurable optimist will tip Ezinwa for a medal. Ezinwa's best time was the Nigeria Mobil trial performance of 9.89 secs. via the archaic hand timing device. Other Nigerians that will compete in the 100 metres dash are Olapade Adeniken, Osmond Ezinwa, Deji Aliu and home based new discovery, Seun Ogunkoya. Going by current form and desperation for glamour, they may end up as also rans. Only Davidson Ezinwa has a good chance of making it to the finals where it could be anybody's race but his own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the women's event, Mary Onyali, who told the nation to expect her best, may find her best not good enough for gold when the gun goes off. The African track queen will find the hot Atlanta climate too hot for comfort when she takes on Gail Devers and Gwen Torrence, both of the United States, Marlene Ottey of Jamaica and Irina Privaloua of the Russian Republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other Nigerian sprinters in the dash event will be lucky should they make it to the last eight in the world. Chioma Ajunwa, who will be competing in her first ever Olympic Games and who finished sixth behind Onyali's fifth position at the Laussane grand prix, will power fast but not fast enough to mount the medal rostrum after the tape must have been breasted. Same goes for Charity Opara-Thompson and Beatrice Utondu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tony Urhobo, athletes coach, told Theweek that should either Onyali or Ajunwa get to the finals, the 100 metres could be anybody's race. Urhobo, based on his assessment, will go down as an optimist because there will be no stopping the stiff competition between Ottey, Privalova, Torrence and Devers for the race to pick the gold, silver and bronze medals at stake. All Onyali, Ajunwa, Utondu and Opara-Thompson may do is pick up the numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Same will be the case in the men's 200 metres. This race will attract world attention but the zoom lens will not be focussed on Olapade Adeniken, Deji Aliu and Francis Chikwelu. Never a good runner to place a bet on, Adeniken is the one likely to make it to the last eight. The others will likely watch from the stands as Fredricks takes on America's Michael Johnson.  Onyali will, like Adeniken, lead Calista Uba and Utondu to a 200 metres female event where they will savour the joy of participating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even without being told, Sunday Bada knows that he will need more than legs to beat Johnson, who many expect to pick up the gold in the 400 metres event baring unforeseen circumstances. Bada, who has had a fairly good year, should be able to do well and get to the finals where he can then be sure of picking a medal should his legs combine effectively with his heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria's best chance in the athletics individual event lies in the 400 metres women event. Here, Falilat Ogunkoya, making a return after a lay-off that saw her giving birth to a son, stands a good medal chance. In the prestigious Laussane meet she came second behind lanky French runner Marie Joyce-Perec, the world record holder in the event. Twice they have met before the games in recent times and twice the French woman had dusted Ogunkoya. The Nigerian has expressed delight that she is putting the pressure on Joyce-Perec. &quot;My confidence is building because I know she knows I am coming.  The nation should expect the very best from me,&quot; Says Ogunkoya. Fatima Yusuff, who came third at the Mobil Olympic trials, will be ruled out at the peril of other competitors. The African record holder has a habit of coming from the dead to record impressive performance. She also has the habit of disappointing when the stakes are high. Olabisi Afolabi, who as at last week was still stuck in Italy, will also put in her best in this event when she eventually makes the trip to Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the estimation of many respected analysts, the nation with the good baton exchange should garner medals in the relay events. Ayo Ositelu, a veteran of many Olympics and a revered newspaper sports columnist, believes that the Nigerian female 4 x 400 metres relay stands a good chance to win the country her first gold medal. His view is shared by Urhobo, who give the sub - 50 secs recently run by three of the athletes as a good reason for the team to strike gold. The same goes for the female 4 x 100 metres although Onyali and Ajunwa are the only Nigerian women to have run legal sub - 11 secs. At the Bacelona Olympics, Onyali led Faith Idehen, Utondu and Opara-Thompson to capitalise on a faulty baton exchange by the Jamaican girls to win an unprecedented bronze medal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the shout &quot;seconds out&quot; rings out at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Nigeria will present four pugilist to trade punches for glory in the square ropes. It was boxing that produced Nigeria's first olympic medal - a bronze medal won at the Tokyo Games in 1964 by Nojeem Maiyegun. Again in 1972, it was boxing that put Nigeria on the medals table when Isaac Ikhuoria won another bronze at the Munich Games. The sport proved its special place in the country's Olympic Games history when Peter Konyegwachie punched his way to a silver medal performance after a controversial loss to Meldrick Taylor of the United States in the Los Angeles game. Two silver medals it was that went to the boxing team via a stupendous performance by Richard Igbinegbu and David Izonretei after good preparations by the late Brai Ayonote and his team for the last games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in Atlanta, shoddy performance and the politics that have plagued the sport's local government body will rob the country of medals in a sport that has given her the most memorable moments at the Olympics. Not lacking in quality boxers, the country qualified for six out of the 77 slots allotted Africa at the games, although she could have clinched 12. Super heavyweight, Duncan Dokiwari, sole gold medalist at the All-Africa Games in Harare last September, and Albert Eromosele, the light middleweight who emerged African champions at the continental championship in Tunis in March, lead other pugilists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the chances of the boxing team, Jerry Okorodudu, who got to the quarter final stage during the Los Angeles Olympics, does not see much to expect. He highlighted the lackadaisical approach of the sports ministry to settle the rift in the Nigerian Amateur Boxing Association, the quality of coaches as well as a strong opposition, as stumbling blocks to any medal hope in boxing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You learn boxing by boxing, not by training,&quot; he said, citing the case in the Nigerian boxing camp before the boxers left for the United States.  &quot;When you spar with the same partner everyday, it gets monotonous and you don't learn anything new.&quot; Before the Barcelona Olympics, boxers that took part in the games participated in the European qualifier in Halle, Germany in March 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The next month Ayonote took them to Bangkok, where they traded punches at the 18th edition of King's Cup in Thailand. Later in May they took part in the international Berlin Boxing championship. They did not fail to plan and they succeeded. For the Los Angeles Games where the Nigerian pugilists were robbed but still won a silver medal, Odorodudu said they had international competition almost every month enroute the games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Dokiwari, Eromosele, Barnabas Imudia and Kehinde Aweda, only a miracle will see them beating the computer scoring device to get to the medal range. Already, Dokiwari and Eromosele have their concentration divided as they have signed on with the Ken Norton boxing camp in the United States to pursue a professional career at the end of the olympics. Twenty three year-old Dokiwari, who has won the Eagle twice consecutively, remains the country's best medal potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By African standards, the table squad that will be storming Atlanta will be an all stars parade. Bosed Kaffo, Funke Oshonaike and Kehinde Okenla have all won African titles many times. Sule Olaleye, Segun Toriola, Hakeem Hassan and Kazeem Nosir are the men's team Africa's torch-bearers. Table Tennis coach Olanrewaju Babatunde told Theweek on the teams' return to Lagos after the training camp in Ilorin that his players &quot;are determined to surprise many people.&quot; He said that his team, which only began serious training last May for the Atlanta games, would do away with the impression of not rising up to the challenge during the meets outside Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the chairman of the Nigerian Table Tennis Association was more realistic in his expectation from the Olympics. According to him: &quot;Those who succeed in the sports do not organise sports the way we do in Nigeria. You need long term vision and planning to succeed.&quot; He added that the sport has gone scientific where players need very good knock-up hall, bats, balls and other facilities. &quot;Our players do not get good ranking at international level because they lack exposure and don't compete internationally.&quot; he pointed out.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the table tennis event begins at the 71,000-seat Georgia Dome, there will be no time for excuses as the Chinese and the Swedish teams, together with other competing countries, will not welcome any. In the weightlifting event in which the country is yet to win a medal, Nigeria will be presented by Moji Oluwa and Innocent Ukpong who have reputations for pulling surprises. Both weight lifters have been out in the United States undergoing training for close to two months but it remains to be seen whether they will surpass the fourth placing of Ojadi Aduche during the Barcelona Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fond Olympic memories will be made from these and many actions that will engage the attention of the world from July 19 to August 4. Many would try to see if Johnson will set the record of being the first man to win the 200 metres and 400 metres events at the same Olympics. To achieve the record and put his name in the record books, the race schedule has been changed to aid his run for immortality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But 28-year old Fredricks, whose name is bigger than his country Namibia, could spoil Johnson's fun. In the pre-Olympic meet, the Namibian became the first athlete to beat the world champion when he made 19.82 secs in cold, wet and windy condition. The new Commonwealth record was enough to send jitters down the spine of Johnson, who knows that going into the ultimate challenge, Fredricks has a mental edge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Atlanta it could even be worse for Johnson, as the harsh weather condition could make him a victim of the heat of Georgia. He will feel the effects of the four grueling 400 metres race and will be running his fourth 200 metres in a space of 30 hours by the time he gets to the finals. Against Fredricks and Mike Marsh, even the slightest hint of dehydration could spell disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Fredricks this could turn out to be his year, all things being equal. He seems to have found his own supply of kryptonite and could make Africa proud. In Lausanne he ran a stunning 9.86 secs into a headwind, only 100th of a second off Burrel's world record. The week before, the Namibian had run 9.86 secs during a chilly night in Helsinki. This brilliant performance came after a brilliant inndoor season in which he broke the 100 and 200 metres world records. His form this year has been exceptional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fredricks has moved out of the shadows of the supporting cast to that of a major player. In the Los Angeles Games, Carl Lewis was the King. At Bacelona, Britain's Christie stole the show. At Atlanta, the name that might be on everybody's lip at the end of the whole show could be Africa's own Fredricks and not home boy Johnson. Olympics moments are made of feats like this.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - If Mike Torey, military administrator of Enugu State, lays claim to clairvoyance in this particular matter, he would be justified. When he inaugurated a 10-member task force February 29, his conviction was that a good percentatge of the state's internally generated revenue does not enter government treasury but is diverted by some fraudulent government officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Torey's fear was confirmed May 8, when the task force headed by Steve Odutayo, an army major, completed its assignment and discovered that true to Torey's fear, 26 sub-tresurers and revenue collectors in the state defrauded the Enugu State government of the sum of N32,699,722.74 between January 1, 1994 and the end of May last year. The task force also found that a total of N69,104,086 is being owed the state by 10 government organisations and institutions as money deducted from their staff as Pay-As-You-Earn.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alleged to be deeply involved in the fraud is C.I.J. Afeli, sub-treasurer in the main sub-treasury, Enugu, who the task force recommended should pay N14,078,656.63. According to the report of the task force, Afeli appeared before it for about five times to reconcile his accounts. In the end, he submitted three different details of accounts and each of the three submissions contradicted the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the event, the task force had to rely on the paper money register submitted by the sub-treasurer in the headquarters of the Ministry of Finance. The task force said that it could not obtain from A feli a complete bank statement covering the period, hence his statement could not be used to get his total credits and debits. However, the task force said that it was able to pick his opening and closing balances. Based on what it called the unreliability of the data submitted by Afeli, the task force carried out a &quot;thorough scrutingy of his account&quot; and arrived at its conclusions. The task force noted that out of a total revenue of N63,583,503.94 found to have been collected by Afeli, what he could account for was N49,504,847,31, leaving N14,078,656.63 unaccounted for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the course of its assignment, the task force went through cheque stubs of the sub-treasurer and discovered that three cheque numbers; 673619B, 673621B and 673630B amounting to N3,470,000, were irregularly drawn from the sub-treasurer's account between November 1994 and April 13 last year. The task force also discovered that payments were made to organisations and individuals directly from the revenue account by Afeli against financial instructions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The task force noted that N28,103,881,02 was involved in the irregular payments, out of which N28,041,742,20 was alleged to have been used for payment of salaries. The difference of N62,138,82 was found to have been paid to individuals and organisations. The report also showed that the sub-treasurer drew five cheques amounting to N3,979,000 in favour of himself.  The purpose of drawing the cheques could not be investigated, for, according to the report, &quot;when the sub-treasurer was to be queried on this, he collasped on the floor of the House of Assembly, Enugu, venue of the task force's sitting and could not show up again till the report was finally compiled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other irregularities discovered by the task force includes the activities of C.O. Onwe, sub-treasurer for ikwo in Ikwo Local Government Area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Onwe appeared before the task force last April 11, t0 reconcile his own accounts for the period between January 1, 1994 and May 31, 1995. During his submission, it was discovered that he operated three accounts: Development levy account number 9372, revenue account number 9373 and payment account number 5035, all in the Africa Continental Bank, Ikwo branch. Amount brought forward in 1994 from account number 9372 and 9373 and collections made stood at N1,744,808,01.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From this amount, the sub-treasurer claimed that he remitted to the accountant-general's office N724,262,27, bounced cheques amounted to N25,463,75, and ban charges of N10,552,16. The task force rejected this account by Onwe because, according to it, the N724,268,27 claimed to have been remitted by the sub-treasurer to the accountant-general's office was higher than what the AG's office and the paper money register confirmed.  While the AG's office acknowledged total remittance of N677,614,91, the paper money register confirmed N700,402,27. Further, the task force said it rejected Onwe's claim because &quot;he has not got enough facts to support his claims.&quot; It however, accepted the paper money figure of N700,402,27 because &quot;it is the authentic document in which all remittances to the AG's office and government should pass through.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The task force also rejected the claim by Onwe that he received bounced cheques amounting to N25,463,75 for lack of evidence in support of the claim.  After examining Onwe's account as submitted to the task force, it was discovered that he had to account for N1,033,570,55. When asked to do so, he allegedly was unable to do so. He admitted that he instructed the bank to transfer the sum of N591,500 from his revenue account into his payment account. He further said that he spent the balance of the sum on private matters. Like what? Onwe revealed that he used the said amount to build a private house, which he was ready to sell off to refund the money. On May 2, he submitted the particulars of the house, including the Deed of Assignment, Power of Attorney, land rent, receipt, notice of assessment, and approval of building plan to the task force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other sub-treasurers in some other local government areas are said to be withholding between N3,700,00 and N1,033,570,55 each which should have been lodged in the state government's account.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - The scanty audience that attended the public sitting of the National Reconciliation Committee in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, July 2, was enough signal to Alex Akinyele, a former Information and Culture Minister and Chairman of the committee, that all would not be well that day. The first hint of trouble came when eight weight lifters of the Rivers State Sports Council distracted the session with noise while working out in the adjoining room at the Diette Spiff Sports Complex, venue of the committee's sitting.  Not even the personal intervention of the traditional rulers, secretary of the Rivers State government and the police stopped the weight lifters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead of reducing their noise, the sports men flared up &quot;Do you think we are fighting here?&quot; asked one of them. &quot;Go and do your business over there. Don't disturb us. Everyday meeting, meeting, meeting and yet nothing works.&quot; It took the leader of the weight lifters more than ten minutes to calm down his men. A flustered Akinyele recoiled into his seat, waiting for a cue from Sampson Agbaru, secretary to the state government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After Akinyele's introductory address which outlined the committee's mission in the state, Robinson O. Robinson, a frontline ruler threw a bombshell. &quot;Who are you reconciling now? he asked the committee. Robinson told the committee that as far as he was concerned, nobody was quarreling that that required national reconciliation. The NARECON delegation was taken aback but the audience got the traditional ruler's message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chukumela Nnam Obi, Oba of Ogoniland and immediate past chairman of the Rivers State Council of Chiefs, elaborated the issues at stake. He told the committee that the issues necessitating national reconciliation are numerous and should be addressed in the interest of the citizenry. &quot;The June 12 issue is still unresolved; the crisis in education needs urgent attention and the problem of the neglected oil communities need to be addressed,&quot; he said. The Oba asserted that the issue of state creation which has affected the growth of Rivers State is a national issue, adding that only the splitting of Rivers could end the communal hostilities in the state. The elated audience responded with applause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Next to take the floor was Harold Dappa-Biriye, the octogenarian statesman and community rights activist. Backed up with a memorandum and photographs, Dappa-Biriye presented an 11-point address aptly tagged &quot;Issues for National Discussion and Reconciliation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Worried by government's disregard for community rights, Dappa-Biriye stressed that the restiveness in the oil producing communities is a direct result of neglect and underdevelopmemt. According to him, laws guiding the prospecting of natural resources and minerals should be uniform and should accord respect for community rights. He recalled that in 1980 the Oyo State government signed a law on the Igbeti Marble which accorded the host community its right thus: Igbeti community 15 per cent, local government 10 per cent, prospecting company 25 per cent, federal government 20 per cent and the state government 30 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dappa-Biriye warned that the government and the prospecting companies must be ready to accord the host communities 30 per cent of the proceeds as stated if the Liquified Natural Gas Project is to take off. Regretting the disrespect shown to traditional rulers and the civil society by the military, the elder statesman lambasted the military for disregarding the ethics of democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cyrus Nunieh, a former senator and lawyer from Ogoni, told the NARECON team that the &quot;Ogoni have made enough sacrifices for the survival of the nation. The Ogoni issue must be looked into if genuine peace and progress must go on in the state. There is uneasy calm in Ogoni.&quot; Other speakers at the forum drew the attention of the committee to the Ogoni Bill of Rights (the working document of the Ogoni people), the human and environmental degradation in the Niger Delta and the human rights situation in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The committee visted Ogoniland and promised to send another team to tour some areas in the state to verify claims of neglect and underdevelopment by the people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - The honeymoon between Muhammadu Maccido, the Sultan of Sokoto and the government of Sani Abacha may have come to an abrupt end. The reason, according to sources, is that the government is not impressed by Maccido's speech at his installation and presentation of staff of office last month.  The sultan had in his speech urged the government to address the unprecedented suffering of Nigerians, just as he described the democratization programme of the government as &quot;not a real thing to Nigeria.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before now, the government had frowned at the Sultan's comments on the annulled June 12, 1993 presidential election, which he once described as just another injustice, like the overthrow of Shehu Shagari government by the military in 1983. According to government's sources, Maccido's comment on the voided presidential election calls into questions government's reason for deposing Ibrahim Dasuki, who &quot;hijacked&quot; the sultanate from Maccido in 1988, since the June 12 annulment and other injustices have not been redressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Already, rumours believed to have been started by government agents are now making the rounds, alleging that the installation and presentation of staff of office to Maccido was marred because the sultan allegedly failed to make available to the organising committee, the full amount of money the federal government donated towards the installation ceremony. Sidi Mamman Asarakawa, vice-chairman of the finance committee, has reportedly been asked to explain how the money was disbursed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At Maccido's installation, Ibrahim Sulu Gambari, the emir of Ilorin, had complained bitterly about the accommodation that was provided for him. Umaru Shinkafi, ex-presidential aspirant, had to use his powerful connections to secure a more dignifying accommodation for Gambari. But the emir of Gombe was not so lucky. He passed the night at an uncompleted guest house belonging to a serving military administrator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Sokoto State government is yet to release the report of the panel that probed the installation ceremony. As the report is being awaited, Maccido is said to be feeling uncomfortable that the government which used him to settle its problem with Dasuki, is abandoning him too soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Theweek learnt that government's attitude has re-enforced Maccido's determination to see Dasuki and to get the government to allow Dasuki to move to any place of his choice. Since Dasuki's removal, no member of his family has been allowed access to him. Sources told Theweek that when Maccido recently visited Abacha, one of the issues they discussed was the possibility of allowing Dasuki's family to see him, a postition that Shehu Malami, Dasuki's arch rival and Nigeria's High Commissioner to South Africa, and Mustapha Jokolo, emir of Gwandu, do not share. Jokolo, for one, has been most caustic in his public remarks on the former sultan. Sources said that he has not forgiven Dasuki for influencing his removal as the chairman of Gamji Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unsure of government's continued goodwill, Maccido is said to be redesigning the palace to suit his meagre resources. He is reportedly removing conveniences which would require enormous financial resources to maintain. According to sources, the sultan needs more than N6 million monthly to run the palace. Government's alleged unwillingness to provide the needed resources is said to have informed Maccido's pragmatic decision to reduce his expenses to the barest minimum. How long his apparently strained relationship with the Abacha regime would last remains to be seen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington DC - Following are the prepared statements by Prudence Bushnell, deputy assistant secretary of State for African Affairs, and by Carol Peasley, senior deputy assistant administrator for Africa of the U.S.  Agency for International Development (AID). They appeared before the Senate African Affairs Subcommittee on July 11 chaired by Kansas Republican Senator Nancy Kassebaum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bushnell testimony --<BR> Madam Chairman, I am delighted to be here with you today to discuss women in Africa. I thank you for bringing attention to the issue of African women by holding this hearing and for your invitation to testify. Tomorrow I relinquish my responsibilities within the Bureau of African Affairs and I can think of no better way to spend my last full day as Deputy Assistant Secretary. In the three years I have served in African Affairs, it has become clear to me that the success of U.S. policy objectives in Africa rests, in part, on helping African women enhance their status in society and their participation in public life:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * We cannot promote democracy and respect for human rights without taking into account the role and treatment of women, who make up over 50 percent of the population of Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * In our efforts to prevent or resolve conflict, we must recognize that women and children are the primary victims of conflict in Africa; they are also the primary beneficiaries of humanitarian assistance and comprise the largest percentage of the refugee population. However, women also have a critical role to play in conflict resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * The role and contributions of women to Africa's sustainable economic development are profound. In the agricultural sectors and the informal economy they are preeminent actors. Efforts to protect the environment, manage population growth and develop the continent's economic future must take women into account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If we are beginning to view African women as critical partners we also recognize that they are not yet full partners in many aspects of their own societies. Women in Africa have made progress in some areas, but much still needs to be addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the Deputy Assistant Secretary responsible for global issues, I have made a concerted effort to put women on our policy agenda. I have made it a point to spend time with African women on my many visits to the sub-Saharan continent; I attended the Africa Preparatory Conference for the Beijing Women's Conference and have listened to African reactions to the Conference.  To encourage follow up attention to the Beijing Action Plan, I asked our ambassadors to speak to the delegations and consider what we may have to offer to help countries implement their action plan. In Washington, the Africa Bureau is putting greater emphasis on women's human rights and participation in democratization when we review small program proposals under the 116E funding mechanism; we are looking for opportunities to speak out about African women in public fora and we are coordinating our strategies with other parts of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although I did not attend the Beijing Conference myself, I think it helped to advance African women's interests and show the world what African women have to offer. African delegations left a strong and positive impression because of their unity of purpose and their ability to articulate and negotiate. Senegal, which led the Africa group, demonstrated strong leadership in uniting diverse delegations into a cohesive whole; the Ugandans were acknowledged as leaders in the developing world in efforts to empower women, youth and the handicapped; and the Ghanaians were singled out for making meaningful improvements towards bettering the status and welfare of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African women to whom I have spoken since the Conference were invigorated by the sense of solidarity and the enormous array of ideas they encountered in Beijing. Learning that others around the world are struggling with many of the same issues they confront provided them a sense of partnership to a larger effort. Many were determined to maintain the networks they had formed -- particularly in southern Africa. Others felt that the contact between their government and NGO delegations contributed to a better understanding and appreciation of one another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When one looks across the political landscape of sub-Saharan Africa, one sees an increase in the number of women leaders, but the total is still modest. The most senior ranking woman in sub-Saharan Africa is the Vice President of Uganda, who is herself committed to advancing the issues of women and girls. In Sao Tome and Principe, the country's first woman candidate for President garnered 14 percent of the vote on the first round to become king-maker for the July 21 second-round vote. In Kenya, women announced plans to form a political party led by women that would be &quot;home&quot; to all disadvantaged groups. In Uganda, 39 seats in a parliament of 276 members have been set aside for women. Overall, however, only 9.8 percent of the members of lower houses of Parliament in sub-Saharan African countries are women per data from the African-American Institute and only about 80 Cabinet-level positions of more than 900 are held by women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of the constraints to greater political participation by women include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Too little money to help finance strong NGOs or to campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Lack of political knowledge, including knowledge of their basic civic rights and responsibilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Lack of skills and information necessary to compete with men as equals in the political arena.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Inhibiting societal attitudes about women's roles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa's courageous women political leaders also face other problems which we do not confront here. Rwandan Prime Minister Agathe Uilingimana, who worked to implement that country's peace agreement, was among the first victims of the 1994 genocide. In Liberia, one of the women with whom you met during your January visit, Madam Chairman, was kidnapped and threatened, her house looted after criticizing publicly one of the warlords. In Nigeria, a courageous woman journalist is isolated and imprisoned for criticizing the regime. These women spoke out publicly. Meanwhile, countless thousands of others work quietly behind the scenes to form associations and groups to push for recognition of the basic human rights which we too often take for granted here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More and more NGOs are working in individual countries on women's political participation, often with the help of USG funding provided through USAID. My colleague, Deputy Assistant Administrator for African Affairs Carol Peasley, can give you more specifics on USAID programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When I meet with African women I am often struck by the challenges and dreams they hold in common with American women. African women active in politics and the modern economy have talked to me about the subtle and overt forms of discrimination they face, much of it familiar to me. They talk about the delicate behavior necessary to confront hostility without becoming &quot;strident.&quot; They discuss the pros and cons of affirmative action and they voice concern about a backlash from those who feel threatened by women's advances -- this includes other women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women in rural areas also hold things in common with us. One encounter I had with Tuareg women in Niger brought this home to me. Our Ambassador arranged a trip to the north, where the wife of the local prefect (herself a former Minister of Development) organized a meeting with women from three local cooperatives. As we sat in the shade of one of the few concrete buildings in the area, I was very aware of the chasm between our two worlds.  Culture, language, education, religion and race divided us. My questions and remarks had to be translated from French into both Hausa and Tuareg. Yet, when I asked them what dreams they had for their daughters, they replied that they wanted their daughters to be self-sufficient -- to have some education and to learn a trade. I responded that many of us in the United States hold the same dream for our daughters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is much Africans must do if they are to realize their dreams for their daughters. While the increase and visibility of educated and professional women is notable, their numbers are still woefully small and the divide between them and the majority of uneducated, rural women stunningly large. In the same conversation I had with Tuareg women they talked about why many did not send their daughters to be educated -- fear of ridicule from their neighbors and concern that education would &quot;spoil&quot; their daughters as prospective wives. Traditional customs, practices and laws often form tremendous obstacles to women's advancement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following the Beijing Women's Conference, our embassies asked host country delegations which aspects of the Platform for Action were most critical to their country. The themes that emerged focused on women's and girls' education; eliminating domestic violence; increasing women's participation in politics; improving access to credit; and help in the health sector, issues which I believe will resonate with you, Madam Chairman, in your role as Chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is ironic that at the very time we find African women leaders articulating concrete needs we could help them address, we find ourselves constrained from doing so because of budget cuts! There is still much we can do. The USIA international visitor programs which bring African women political leaders to the U.S., such as a visit last year of members of the new South African parliament, remains an outstanding means of exposing African women to American democratic institutions. We can -- and do -- make reference to women in our policy speeches; our senior officials can highlight women's needs and accomplishments during visits to the continent. We can -- and do -- encourage other donors and officials of the international financial institutions to target women more directly. We can better coordinate initiatives on gender issues. But we also need resources. And I can think of no better investments than those targeted to the enhancement of the role and contributions of African women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I want to end by noting your contributions to Africa, Senator Kassebaum, both as a role model and an advocate. Many African women have already been touched by your work and I thank you for your interest in this area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ENDS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peasley testimony --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Madam Chairwoman, I'm very pleased to be part of this important nearing and to have the opportunity to share ideas with you this afternoon. There are four key themes I would like to emphasize:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1) the important role that African women play and the disadvantages they labor under;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2) that African women are increasingly in a position to articulate their own needs and priorities;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3) that we in USAID are listening to them and following their leadership in the design and implementation of many different kinds of activities; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4) I'd like to share some examples of successful USAID programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We know that African women have always played an extraordinarily important role on the continent. That role, however, is evolving rapidly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are all aware of the articulate and dynamic women from Africa who have captured media attention at recent international conferences on women and social issues. Working individually and together, these African women and their many sisters are also making progress at home through greater participation in politics and the economy and by enhancing their legal status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clearly, in recent years Africans and donors have increasingly recognized the importance of full participation of women to successful sustainable development strategies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One key discernible trend that seems to be emerging from this is that more African girls are going to school, although on average they still represent only 43 percent of the primary school enrollment, and their share decreases as the level of schooling increases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The gains in education and other positive developments are encouraging, but they are only a start. USAID intends to remain a major player in partnership with others to foster even greater improvements in the status of African women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As I see it, we face four major constraints or challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First, the inherent systemic biases against women throughout society need to be eliminated. These include discriminatory laws, customs and practices (in business, government services, the courts, classrooms, village councils and so on) that undercut efforts to improve the status of women.  African advocates of gender equity give priority to this problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Second, more women need to participate at the policy and political levels, especially in parliaments. On average women constitute about 10 percent of members of parliament in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Third, we need to devise more effective strategies for encouraging fuller understanding and support of African men to gender equity, particularly men in leadership positions from the village to the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fourth, poverty must be reduced. Lack of resources at the national, regional, local and household levels is a major impediment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meeting these challenges requires an intimate understanding of the various societies in Africa and the recognition that the path may be different from our own. The solutions must come from the Africans themselves.  Given this, our approach emphasizes strengthening the capacity of African institutions (including NGOs, governments and parliaments) and investing as much as we can in economic growth, which is key to the sustainability of all our efforts in all sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Africa Bureau's strategy regarding women's empowerment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In view of these challenges and the strong African leadership that is emerging in this area, USAID and the Africa Bureau are more committed than ever to helping women realize their potential as leaders and as economic, social, and political forces for development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This commitment starts from the top of Africa Bureau management. AFR/AA (Africa Bureau Assistant Administrator) John Hicks is a vocal advocate of gender-conscious development assistance and has provided strong leadership in this area. He challenges us at every level -- macro, sectoral and project and in dialogue with our partners -- to ensure that gender is a cross-cutting theme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Africa Bureau's Women in Development theme dates back to the mid-1970s, shortly after passage of the Percy Amendment. Our efforts were strengthened and sharpened with the inception of the Development Fund for Africa in 1987. The DFA provided clear guidance for the participation of and consultation with women on the design, monitoring and implementation of projects. I am proud to say that as a result, the Africa Bureau has become a trailblazer in USAID on gender-sensitive programming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have made important inroads, but there is potential to do so much more. And this potential is uniquely promising given the extensive nature of informal organizations and cooperation among women in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Africa Bureau has long recognized that &quot;women's projects&quot; are not the answer. The overarching goal has been to integrate and mainstream gender issues throughout our development assistance programs and policy reform initiatives in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reengineering process in the Agency is an excellent opportunity to expand our efforts because of the sharpened focus on participation and the customer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the most part, the systems that help ensure a gender focus in our programs in Africa are in place. We have established guidance incorporating gender into country program strategies and for monitoring the performance of our programs for gender inclusion. Gender disaggregation of data and reporting on gender-specific impact are consistently emphasized in our annual reporting documents on program performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am pleased to report that our missions and Washington have responded well. For example, over the past year, missions in South Africa, Mali, Namibia, Ghana, Kenya and Tanzania have submitted country strategic plans that reflect the significant gender dimensions of the country programs. The missions early on seek out help in developing their strategies from the regional gender advisers located in Abidjan and Nairobi. Local women's groups are consulted extensively in the process. Washington reviews are characterized by broad participation throughout the Agency, including the Office of Women in Development. The bottom line is: the systems work, and they are internalized in our Bureau operations and culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Social, political and economic empowerment of African women</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a direct connection between the series of U.N.-sponsored international conferences in Nairobi, Dakar, Copenhagen and Beijing and the emergence of African women and women's associations as powerful forces with clear roles in Africa's future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conference preparations and the conferences themselves have offered African women the opportunity to network, to develop skills and to legitimize themselves and their organizations in ways previously unknown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are other factors that have contributed significantly to the successes African women have achieved at these international fora. The political liberalization sweeping African countries since the beginning of the 1990s has meant that large numbers of women (and men) are, for the first time, able to organize and address issues of concern at the regional, national and pan-African levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although recent achievements of African women and certainly their higher profile have arisen from new opportunities, strong connections with one another and the existence of powerful women leaders are nothing new in Africa. The crisscrossing web of women's associational life has long been a defining feature of many African societies. From mutual aid groups to civic associations dealing with schools and water access to traders' associations, these women's organizations set a standard for what can be done through initiative and broad participation, and they provide practical experience.  The connections from the village to the newer, high-profile international organizations are not as distant as they might appear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> USAID sees its role now and into the future as one of fundamental support for the processes that are enabling African women to realize their existing potential. USAID will continue to engage a multi-level, multi-track approach in its efforts to empower African women and foster greater social, economic and political participation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Activities at the national and international level are aimed at improving the skills of African women legislators, lawyers and advocates. The ultimate purpose of these programs is to build the capacity of influential leaders to create an enabling environment that fosters economic, social and political participation for all women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last year in Uganda, for example, all 52 women members of Uganda's Constituent Assembly attended a USAID-sponsored workshop on the &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; of effective legislation. And in Malawi, 100 women participated in a political empowerment workshop. These women have been key in the adoption of a new constitution that reflects women's issues and in the publishing of a standard guide and resource entitled Women and the Law in Malawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Further examples of these activities are discussed in reprints from the USAID-funded African Voices newsletter. Madam Chairwoman, I request that these newsletter articles be made a part of the record for this hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At another level, USAID encourages and promotes significant women's participation in all of our sectoral development programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Up to two-thirds of our micro-enterprise loan recipients are women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women are central to our activities in the health sector; with obviously strong roles to play in child survival, nutrition, family planning and HIV/AIDS prevention. Surveys clearly demonstrate the strong desire of many women to have the ability to space, or limit the number of children they have. There is growing demand by women for family planning services. Also, with the high level of HIV prevalence in many countries (e.g., some 30 percent of urban women visiting ante-natal clinics in the most heavily affected countries are testing HIV positive), African women are leading the charge to improve HIV/AIDS education and control programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I think that because of the central role women play in Africa's development, our activities that fully incorporate gender concerns show a unique tendency to generate positive multiplier effects and program synergies. An interesting example comes from Namibia, where an association of women traders or hawkers had been working with our program to help Namibian NGOs strengthen their institutional capacity. On their own the women decided that what they really needed to do was to use their institutional strength to help fight HIV/AIDS in the rural areas where they had come from and where many of their future customers would come from. Knowing well what types of practices and behaviors needed changing, the women developed their own educational and informational program and used a grant from the USAID activity to take their campaign throughout rural Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is now well established that an educated women is likely to have a higher income as well as a healthier and smaller family. Efforts to improve and promote girls' schooling are fundamental to our successful approach to basic education. In our eight major basic education programs in Guinea, Mali, Ghana, Benin, Ethiopia, Uganda, Malawi and Namibia, USAID and its partners are working to enact reforms that remove barriers at the national level while simultaneously working directly with communities to give them more say in dealing with the constraints that have kept girls out of school in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> USAID's concentration on girls' education is beginning to pay dividends.  In Malawi, for example, USAID pilot tested a Social Mobilization Campaign to elicit the support and participation of parents, teachers and communities to educate girls. The results of the pilot were outstanding. There was a marked increase in girls' enrollment in the 1995/96 school year, the drop-out rate for girls was lower than for boys (for the first time ever), and of the 239 pupils in that district selected for secondary school, 106 were girls. The participatory approach is now active in 72 villages and communities around Malawi and further expansion will take place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Malawi model is indicative of our approach to girls' education. Our programs focus on what is needed to improve access and quality for girls.  Girls' needs are additive to the needs of boys given the traditional bias against girls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Education is the key to the future for African women, but there is still much more we can do to encourage and help African women deal with the problems they face today. Because of our field presence, USAID officers have numerous opportunities to hear directly from African women. A recurring theme is the desire for greater economic participation and security, particularly in agriculture, the predominant occupation of most women in Africa and where many of them see the greatest hope for improvements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have many successes in promoting women's opportunities in agriculture. In Malawi, women now have access to the more lucrative smallholder burley market. And in Francophone West Africa, USAID support for the women delegates working on the formulation of the Charter of Internal Rules for the CILSS-sponsored Rural Communities' Platform on Grassroots Participation and Policy Dialogue led to the inclusion of significant gender-conscious language and the stipulation that one of the two national delegates to serve on the Regional Council will be a woman. And in Kenya, agricultural policy reforms have resulted in increased farmer income, while simultaneously lowering food prices for the urban poor, most of whom are women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many individual women benefit from USAID programs to promote non-traditional exports. In Uganda, rates of return for rural labor have increased substantially through participation in the non-traditional agricultural program. For example, mushroom growers, the majority of whom are women, now earn an annual net rate of return of $1,500 per growing unit, which means more resources for families to meet their school fees, medical care and food needs. Likewise, vanilla producers, 75% of whom are women, have seen incomes rise over 25%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And in Ghana, female-owned and -managed producer export firms increased by 31 percent. The first Global Women Entrepreneurs Trade Fair and Investment Forum will be held in Ghana this summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These programs are very encouraging and we'd like to do more if the resources were available. Working with African women is a true joy and very rewarding. I'm sure you will hear that message repeated by others addressing you today. I'd like to thank you again for providing the opportunity to discuss this extremely important topic. I know that all of us in the Africa Bureau at USAID hold African women in the highest regard and given the positive changes of the past few years, we anticipate great things to come in the future.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - The Church in Africa should use its lay training centres to promote human rights and civil society on the African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It should also use these centres to promote a just community of men and women as people created in God's image with equal responsibilities in His service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These were some of the recommendations passed during a training seminar on leadership in lay training, held here from June 6 to 25.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The course was organized by the Nairobi-based Association of Christian Lay Centres in Africa (ACLCA), a continental fellowship of Christian lay centres, academies and movements of social concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ACLCA training workshop brought together 30 participants from Egypt, Kenya, Madagascar, Tanzania and Uganda. They came from various centres in the Eastern and Northern Africa sub-region. Also present were representative of the ACLCA Youth Network from Ghana, Uganda, Malawi and South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deliberations were based on the theme, Leadership Training for Building a Just Community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview with APS, ACLCA Executive Secretary Rev. Jonah Katoneene also disclosed that the organization will celebrate its silver jubilee from October 6 to 13 in Harare, Zimbabwe, under the theme Celebrating in Hope: Restoring Just Relationships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The course participants condemned corruption and tribalism, saying the practices affected several countries in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We commit ourselves to be agents of creating a just and ecumenical community, where people accept and respect each other as members of the human community regardless of their differences in tribe, race, culture and traditions,&quot; a communique released at the end of the course stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the ACLCA statement, course participants committed themselves to work for justice, peace and reconciliation and &quot;in particular we commit our centres to be places of healing and reconciliation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The communique also urged churches in Africa to educate their members and called on African governments to pressurize for the cancellation of Africa's external debt, estimated at more than $300 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This pressure should not be left to the churches alone, urged the ACLCA workshop which also called on the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations to add their voices and pressurize for the cancellation of Africa's debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Further on economic justice, course participants promised that they will particularly address themselves to the evils caused by the debt crisis in Africa, saying they do not believe that Africa is indebted to the West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Five hundred years of exploitation of the human resources (slave trade) and the mineral resources of our continent, has made the West rich. The exploitation has continued through other forms of domination such as the imposition of World Bank/International Monetary Fund (IMF) Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs) and debt servicing,&quot; noted the Kampala training workshop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We affirm that the debt has been over-paid. We demand for reparation in the name of justice and Christian love,&quot; participants stressed in their communique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Established in 1970, the ACLCA, currently groups together more than 60 centres in 16 African countries and contact groups in another five countries on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The organization's objectives are to promote contacts and the development of a common purpose between lay training centres in Africa; to encourage common planning and deepen the church's responsibility in the world, and to stimulate the production of materials and information related to lay training among others responsibilities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Niamey - Niger's military ruler General Ibrahim Bare Mainassara claimed an outright victory in the first round of the country's presidential election held on July 7 and 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An announcement by the National Election Commission (CNE) on July 10 said that Mainassara, who seized power in January, had won 1,262,308 (52.22 per cent) of the total vote, beating the man he overthrew, former president Mahamane Ousmane, said to have polled 477,431 votes (19.75 per cent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They were followed by Mamadou Tandja of the National Movement for the Development Society (MNSD) - the country's main party - who polled 372,322 votes (15.65 per cent) and two other candidates, Mahamadou Issoufou and Moumouni Djermakoye Adamou, who garnered 183,826 (7.6 per cent) and 115,302 (4.77 per cent) votes, respectively.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The results will be handed to the supreme court which has 15 days in which to endorse or invalidate the outcome under the country's new electoral code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The election was marred by logistics problems and on July 8, the junta leader dissolved the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI) which had unsuccessfully pressed for more time to organise the poll and appointed another body, the CNE, to replace it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The junta said CENI members had illegally given early results to political parties, thereby influencing the second day of voting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mainassara said the CENI had &quot;manipulated&quot; and &quot;knowingly created a certain disorder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the night of July 8, telephone lines to the opposition candidates as well as those connecting the country to the outside world were cut off, shortly after police had used tear gas to disperse political party supporters who were preparing to stage demonstrations outside party headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The following day, the junta imposed a nationwide ban on demonstrations and public gatherings after threats from the country's Trade Union Federation (USTN) to launch an &quot;unlimited general strike&quot; unless the CENI was reinstated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The abolition of the CENI, the suspension of international telephone lines and rumours of arrests, immediately heightened fears that Mainasassara was staging a second coup to stay in power, which the military strong man immediately denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is not a coup d'etat. I want to tell you the (electoral) process will not be interrupted,&quot; he said, pledging that &quot;I will abide by the verdict of the ballot boxes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mainassara, who seized power on January 27 called the elections under international pressure to restore democracy and in the hope that it would legitimize his position as head of state and offer a viable alternative to traditional politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the month leading up to the poll, the commission repeatedly said it would not be ready in time but the junta twice rebuffed moves by CENI for a postponement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All four challengers sought in vain an audience with Mainassara early last week to complain about the poll's poor organisation. They were also prevented from meeting international observers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yaounde - Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu strongly criticised a decision by African leaders to support Boutros Boutros-Ghali in his bid for a second mandate as United Nations Secretary-General.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing a news conference here on July 10 at the end of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) summit, Bizimungu said that Rwanda, the only one of the 60 countries represented here at the OAU summit to openly express its non-support for Boutros-Ghali, believed that the outgoing UN Secretary-General did not deserve the post again because he had failed to perform to the expectations of Africa during his first five-year term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two other African states present at the summit, Ethiopia and Eritrea, are said to have voiced the opposition to Boutros-Ghali's second tenure of office .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Bizimungu declared that &quot;Rwanda has not supported Ghali because he has not delivered the goods to the expectations,&quot; and castigated the UN chief for his proposal to withdraw more than 2,000 UN troops from Rwanda at the onset of the killings in April 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reduction of the UN presence in the central African state was a betrayal of the Rwandans who were massacred during the pull-out, he charged, declaring: &quot;He has betrayed not only the people who were massacred, but he betrayed the African people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bizimungu said that while other African leaders had supported Boutros-Ghali in the spirit of African solidarity, solidarity had to go with accountability and an evaluation of Boutros-Ghali was negative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bizimungu was also of the opinion that it made sense to support another African who stood better chances of winning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think Africa can find somebody else. I don't think we are short of people who can take up that position,&quot; he said, refusing to mention any possible candidates. Koffi Anan of Ghana is widely tipped to be a potential candidate for the top post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, United States Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs George Moose, who attended the summit to lobby for support from African countries present against Boutros Boutros-Ghali's candidature, told newsmen on July 10 that the US government &quot;understand the support Boutros-Ghali has in Africa and it is entirely appropriate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But I don't think that the declaration is a firm ... and final endorsement&quot; of the candidacy, Moose added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On July 8, Boutros-Ghali defended his record, and pointed to a UN initiative launched in March to improve food security for Africans, diversify Africa's food production and facilitate access to world markets for African agricultural products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tongue-lashing came only five days after Rwandan ministers received sharp reactions from ministers from neighbouring Tanzania and Zaire when they refused to allow the OAU Council of Ministers meeting here to discuss their country's plight, arguing that it was a normal country that did not need any special attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers said the move triggered anger from ministers from the two countries, which are still hosting hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees who fled the 1994 genocide, where between 500,000 and one million people were said to have been slaughtered in the 1994 ethnic violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rwanda's two neighbours argued that the situation could not be normal in Rwanda if so many of its people were still refugees, coupled with persistent reports of continuing ethnic massacres in the war-torn country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was only July 9, that the Rwandan state radio reported that at least 14 people, including a municipal leader, a prosecutor and a school principal, had been killed in two attacks in a north-western Kigali region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many other attacks, either by majority Hutu militants or in reprisal by the minority Tutsi-army, have continued in different parts of Rwanda, leading to hundreds of deaths this year alone.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mogadishu - Continued fighting between rival militias in the Somali capital, Mogadishu left at least 12 dead and 18 wounded overnight, witnesses said on July 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hundreds of families could be seen fleeing the capital, and sporadic shooting was continuing throughout July 10 between forces of General Mohamed Farah Aideed and militiamen supporting north Mogadishu strongman Ali Mahdi Mohamed and those of Osman Hassan Ali &quot;Atto&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fighting was mostly around the south Mogadishu district of Medina, inhabited by Abgal clansmen loyal to Ali Mahdi, the self- styled Somali interim-president.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The battle for Mogadishu has continued since April 4, with no peace negotiations in sight, and some of the shooting last week was across the &quot;Green Line&quot; which divides the capital -- the north controlled by Ali Mahdi and the south by General Aideed and Ali Atto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aideed and Ali Mahdi officials both claimed the capture of one battle-wagon during the overnight fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On July 8, warring militias had been seen gearing up for a battle for overall control of the capital, with fighters from four separate factions taking up defensive positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sporadic shooting had then continued at the &quot;Green Line&quot; dividing the city and in the south Mogadishu enclave of Medina, after three days of fighting which left at least 45 killed and around 100 wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Four of Somalia's many faction leaders appeared to be shaping up for a fight over who is to control this shattered city -- General Aideed, who already commands much of south Mogadishu, Ali Mahdi, who controls the capital north of the &quot;Green Line&quot;, Medina commander Musa Sudi Yalahow, who is allied with Ali Mahdi, and Ali &quot;Atto&quot;, Aideed's former financier but now his bitter foe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aideed's forces pushed several kilometres into Medina in the earlier fighting, but witnesses said they had retreated by July 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yalahow told reporters his men had captured one double-barrel anti- aircraft gun and two &quot;technicals&quot; -- pick up-trucks with heavy weapons mounted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In north Mogadishu, meanwhile, Sheikh Ali Sheikh Mohamud, the powerful chairman of the Islamic court there, said sharia courts would be set up in any territory captured from Aideed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Medina officials meanwhile said 43 per cent of their wounded were dying as a result of lack of medical supplies, adding that equipment promised by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and Somali Red Crescent Society had so far failed to materialize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Somalia has been ruled by warlords since the overthrow of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. UN troops pulled out in March last year after failing to bring peace to the Horn of Africa nation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - A delegation of three women from the Sudanese Women Voice for Peace (SWVP) recently returned to Nairobi after a one-month tour of seven European countries namely France, Britain, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Norway, and Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During their tour to these countries which are interested in developments in the Sudan, the SWVP advocated for peace in what the women termed a &quot;forgotten war&quot; because of the atrocities suffered by fellow women, children, the aged and disabled particularly in southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The team's visit was sponsored by a Catholic church movement for peace, Pax Christi International, CAFOD, a Catholic relief agency and Norwegian Church Aid (NCA).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs Teddy A.D. Lotto, the head of the SWVP delegation told APS the group is intensifying efforts to appeal to the international community to continue advocating for an end to Sudan's 13 year-old war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On their month-long mission, the SWVP team appealed to the host countries to consider the participation of women in all peace initiatives for the Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also appealed for financial support for the girl child education and the youth in southern Sudan, saying the on-going civil war has denied this group the chance to go to school. Most of the youth mainly boys are recruited into the armies of the warring factions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For fellow women, the SWVP team called for support to help their colleagues set up income generating activities that would go a long way in making them economically independent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Sudanese women further asked those countries manufacturing arms, personnel mines and landmines to stop supplying weapons to the warring parties, both the Sudan government and the Sudan Peoples's Liberation Army/Movement (SPLA/M), saying these arms are finishing the population of the people of the Sudan, especially southern Sudan where 1.5 million have been killed since the current civil war began 13 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SWVP also called on the international community to intervene in stopping the ongoing slavery being practised by the Khartoum government in the Nuba Mountains and Northern Bahr El-Ghazal region. &quot;We need to have a just and ever lasting peace in Sudan,&quot; Mrs. Lotto emphasized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The international community is rushing to Bosnia, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Burundi and Somalia but the Sudanese case has not been given its due attention,&quot; observed the head of the SWVP delegation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During their European tour, the women met women groups, church representatives and Members of Parliament in the countries visited, and drew their attention to the suffering in Sudan as a result of the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We want them to appreciate that we are also human beings who need to be assisted. We want our values to be recognised. And this can only be done by ending the war so that we go back to our country and join in nation building,&quot; Mrs. Lotto told APS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, 20 women from Ethiopia, Somali, Somaliland and Sudan met here from June 25 to 30 to discuss the subject, Community Conflict Resolution Management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The six-day training of trainers (TOT) workshop was a forum for women from these countries to share experiences about their role in conflict resolution at the family level and in armed conflict as is the case in Sudan's current civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The workshop also discussed community-based mediation and negotiation in which local chiefs have the authority to resolve any conflict arising either in the family or at neighbourhood level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The workshop was sponsored by the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and facilitated by the South African Institute of Conflict Management.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - A human rights body operating in southern Sudan has accused the Khartoum Government of dropping cluster bombs in the region with the aim of causing death among the civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a press conference here on July 10, a team of Christian Solidarity International (CSI) said; &quot;On June 17, 1996, a total of 12 bombs, at least half of them of the cluster bomb type, were dropped on Chukudum and its population of 5,500 people (20,000 in the surrounding areas), scattering bomblets, which can and do detonate at any given time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bomblets fell next to the local primary school and the Roman Catholic church, whereas a bomb of a different type exploded 300 metres away from a hospital run by the Norwegian People's Aid, said Mr. Gunnar Wiebalck, who addressed the international press conference on behalf of the team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quoting the headmaster of the local school Mr. Joseph Ahileng, Mr.  Wiebalck said; &quot;One of the cluster bombs came down only 500 metres away from his school, in which about 475 children were present.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bombs are also scattered in front of the Roman Catholic church, putting church-goers at great risk, Mr. Wiebalck further said. This has been confirmed by the local priest, Fr. Maurice, who said &quot;we are running like chickens or a rat chased by a cat, we are so vulnerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Khartoum government knows that we have a church here, they want to kill all of us. This has been the 17th time they have bombed our village since August 1993,&quot; Wiebalck further told the press conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quoting the local Catholic priest, Wiebalck said many people feared leaving the village but a good number of them had already fled to the mountains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And referring to information from a local commander of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA), Kuol Deim Kuol, Mr. Wiebalck said...&quot;The government soldiers had intended to disrupt a peace conference between all the tribal chiefs of the area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the SPLA, escalated cattle rustling in the area prompted elders and chiefs to come together to resolve the issue but the government soldiers deliberately targeted the June 17 peace talks. &quot;The Government wants the people of southern Sudan to remain divided. They also know that there is a clinic here. They are after our clinic. Please come to our rescue here in southern Sudan. We are being annihilated,&quot; Wiebalck quoted the local SPLA commander appealing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result of fear brought about by the bombs' dropping, local people have stopped cultivating the affected fields and many are frightened that children will be killed by hundreds of still un- exploded mini-grenades (or bomblets), which the cluster bomb released over wide areas of Chukudum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Displaying some bomblets they had flown to Nairobi from Chukudum, the CSI team said they had already forwarded some of these to military experts to analyze their contents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But addressing the same press conference to which several foreign missions, including those from the member states of the Inter- Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD), and non-governmental organizations working in the Sudan were invited, Ali Sadiq, Counsellor at the Sudanese Embassy in Nairobi, vehemently denied the accusations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Khartoum government is in no way involved in this kind of business.&quot; He also denied that the said site of attacks, Chukudum, is inhabited by civilians and that it has a school and a church. The embassy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> official said contrary to the information availed by the CIS team, Chukudum is a training ground for the SPLA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Everybody is entitled to his/her own opinion, but I wish you could visit the said place and see for yourself the reality we are talking about here,&quot; observed Wiebalck in response to Sadiq. In a statement issued to the press, the CIS team condemned the use of such weapons against civilians, saying such were outlawed by the Geneva convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A member of the CIS at the press conference described cluster bombs as small in size, like toys and wrapped in plastic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On February 8 this year, two American church pastors working in southern Sudan, in their report to the New Sudan Council of Churches (NSCC), accused the Khartoum government of dropping from the air approximately 40 plastic TNT landmines near a community water supply in Ikotos, Eastern Equatoria, southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This marks an escalation of what appears to be a concerted effort to target the civilian population in southern Sudan, said pastors Philip Rieman and Louise Rieman in their report.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oslo - Norway will not apologise to Africans in the Nordic country after officials warned Norwegians not to have unprotected sex, i,e sex without using a condom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About 100 people of African origin living in Norway demonstrated in the streets of Oslo on July 8, terming the Ministry of Health advisory &quot;a racial slur&quot; on people of African descent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a spokesperson for the Ministry of Health of Norway, Ms. Anne Alvik said here that the government was unrepentant. &quot;We do not intend to apologise. Our warning to people to desist from unprotected sex goes for everybody including Norwegians. We simply do not understand why many people from Africa are so resistant to the use of condoms,&quot; she observed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms. Alvik said the whole world was concerned, because the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) pandemic was not just an African problem but a global tragedy. She doubted that the condom warning would stigmatize Africans living in Norway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said most people of African descent living in Norway were HIV- negative. &quot;The problem is that they visit their countries of origin and this may pose a health problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Early this year, the former Israeli Prime Minister Mr. Shimon Perez was forced to apologise to the Ethiopian-Jewish community in Israel (the Farashmura) after an Israel newspaper, the Maariv, reported that blood donated by Jews who came from Ethiopia was routinely destroyed by the Israeli Blood Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thousands of Ethiopian Jews stormed the then Prime Minister's office in Tel Aviv and turned the whole demonstration into an explosion of anger for a litany of grievances against the Jewish state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Prime Minister conceded that the Blood Bank episode was racial and promised that there would be no such generalization in future. Each donation of blood would be treated on its own merit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile the head of the United Nations AIDS Agency (UNAIDS), Dr. Peter Piot has painted a gloomy picture about the spread of the disease that has so far claimed 6 million lives since it was first described in 1981.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at the 11th International AIDS conference in Vancouver, Canada Dr. Piot said 14 million people now carry the virus worldwide, 25 per cent of whom acquired the infection in the last two years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - Cecilia Ogwal, Member of Parliament for Lira Municipality, has appointed her own &quot;Task Force&quot; effectively masterminding a coup within her own Uganda People's Congress Party (UPC) of former president Milton Obote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ogwal's announcement of a task force follows a letter from the exiled former leader who lives in Zambia announcing the appointment of Dr. James Rwanyarare as the new Chairman of the Presidential Policy Commission (PPC) and the de facto leader of the UPC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over the last 10 years since Obote was overthrown, it is Cecilia Ogwal's tenacity that has sustained the spirit of the UPC which earned her the name &quot;Iron Lady&quot;, likening her no-nonsense qualities to those of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a letter dated July 5, Obote instructed that Dr Rwanyarare would be the de facto leader of the UPC in Uganda and &quot;therefore be responsible to the PPC for the management, control and direction of UPC headquarters as well as structures in the countryside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rwanyarare was also appointed chief party spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In another letter to Mrs Ogwal also dated July 5, Obote told her &quot;your actions and statements show that it is your utmost desire to put the UPC in disarray and therefore make it easy prey for the National Resistance Movement (NRM) dictatorship to kill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NRM is led by incumbent President Yoweri Museveni who was recently re-elected by a landslide to another five-year term in office under &quot;a no-party system&quot; of democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs. Ogwal has been bitterly criticised by Obote and Dr Paul Ssemogerere for contesting a parliamentary seat in the parliamentary elections of June 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After he was trounced in the presidential round held on May 9, Ssemogerere said the Inter Party Coalition (IPC) that brought together his Democratic Party (DP) and the UPC would boycott any further elections including parliamentary elections, charging that the Interim Electoral Commission in Uganda was partial. He claimed that the presidential elections were rigged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both Ssemogerere and Obote advised their supporter not to participate in the elections to choose parliamentary representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Cecilia Ogwal defied both men and went ahead. She was elected MP in her Lira constituency. A number of other IPC supporters also participated in the elections which gave the &quot;multipartists&quot; (as the opposition is called in Uganda) about 20 seats out of 260 seats in Uganda's new Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, inaugurating Uganda's new parliament on July 8, President Museveni warned ministers against flouting government financial regulations.  He warned that henceforth he will deal firmly with any cases of malpractises by civil servants and ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am not a puppet of ministers. You should remember I came from the bush, and this time I have come directly from the people...&quot;said the President.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harare - The Zimbabwean government plans to introduce an open prison system which will allow all convicts to interact with their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A general amnesty to cover some classes of prisoners will also be announced by President Robert Mugabe as soon as sufficient ground work has been completed. A parole board has been set up to make recommendations on those who could benefit from the open prison system.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The programme will help prisoners to keep in touch with their families and reintegrate into society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, Mr.  Emmerson Mnangagwa declined to elaborate on the type of prisoners who are earmarked for the parole, it appeared that murder, rape, armed robbery and treason might be excluded from the amnesty which is designed to reduce overcrowding in prisons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At present, nearly all Zimbabwe's 40 prisons are overcrowded, with some of the institutions holding up to one-and-a-half and upwards of their normal capacities in each cell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chikurubi Maximum Security prison in the north, near Harare has a capacity of 1,900 but is currently holding 2,400 prisoners. A cell designed for 23 prisoners is now holding as many as 40.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This overcrowding is also taking its toll on inmates, some of whom are suffering from respiratory diseases, diarrhoea, HIV/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) etc, brought about by poor diet, lack of ventilation and the general unhygienic conditions the prisoners are exposed to among other things. In 1995, about 500 prisoners were reported to have died in the country's prisons from &quot;unknown&quot; ailments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Around the middle of June 1996, minister Mnangagwa toured some of the prisons gauging the general disposition of prisoners before the new system is introduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We intend to introduce the open prison system soon. As I make my tour, I am observing attitudes of prisoners, their co-operation with prison officers and the general disposition to see the type of system we can introduce,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During his tour, he interacted with prisoners, some of whom appealed to the minister to look into their cases for possible review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The minister considered the effects of reduced budgetary allocations to prison services. Most of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inmates' clothes were in tatters and Mr Mnangagwa promised that resources would be made available to ensure that prisoners were adequately clothed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was established that about 370 women and teenagers, who had been convicted of serious crimes such as car-jacking and drug-peddling, were locked up at the female section.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chikurubi is the country's largest prison comprising three sectors - farm, medium and maximum. Most of the food like mealie-meal(maize meal), vegetables, milk and meat supplied to the country's prisons comes from there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One should acknowledge that the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace (CCJP), Zimbabwe's oldest and most influential human rights group, has been vigorously campaigning for all forms of human abuses in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although founded by Catholics, the CCJP is in fact, now an umbrella body for all Christian churches in Zimbabwe. Started at the height of Zimbabwe's liberation war in the 1970s, the CCJP is a strong advocate of political, social and economic rights of the people of this Southern African country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At issue is the Press Trust, Banda's former business conglomerate. The Malawian High Court ruled on July 1 that parliament had failed to follow laid down procedures when it passed a bill last year to restructure the trust, which accounts for up to 40 per cent of Malawi's economy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwaungulu said procedures followed by parliament to restructure the trust were flouted and that the bill did not pass under normal circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Temwa Nyirenda, a lawyer for Banda, had argued that the bill to restructure the conglomerate violated the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The bill was proposed and passed in parliament in bad faith. The motive of the government was solely political and not to benefit the legitimate beneficiaries of the trust,&quot; Nyirenda argued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said banda's rights were violated because the bill effectively expropriates the Press Trust, incorporated by Banda in 1982 when he transferred his shareholding of 500,000 shares in Press Holding to the trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Banda owned practically all the shares in Press Holdings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On July 3, the Malawian government announced that it would immediately lodge an appeal to the Supreme Court over a court ruling against its takeover of the Press Trust, and said that it was &quot;shocked and surprised&quot; at the ruling by the High Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Banda on the other hand maintained in a statement issued on July 2 that it was his personal enterprise, he was pleased with the court ruling and called on the new trustees appointed under the invalid legislation to immediately cease performing their duties and operating the bank accounts of the trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Banda's main MCP party last year walked out of parliament in protest, saying the legislation was passed to restructure the business conglomerate by former coalition partners, the United Democratic Front (DF) of President Bakili Muluzi and the Alliance for Democracy (AFORD).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The MCP charged that parliament had introduced the bill without observing a rule calling for 21 days notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The party also said MPs of UDF and AFORD did not form a quorum and depended on their former parliamentary majority to flout the rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the government had claimed that the business empire was established to benefit the people of Malawi and therefore belonged to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Banda, 97, demanded US dollars 16.6 million for it, if it was going to be taken over by the Malawians, but the government turned down the offer as unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muluzi's government, which ousted Banda in democratic elections in 1994, last year ordered a police probe into the activities of the conglomerate, charging that some 41 million kwacha ($2.7 million) had been diverted from Press Trust to fund Banda's cash-strapped MCP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government wants the company to be free of political influence and no longer accountable to individuals but operate in a transparent manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers say the government was likely to table the bill again, following proper procedures.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - All over Africa, food scientists and technologists are striving and succeeding in developing low cost weaning foods for the growing child based on crops traditionally grown in Africa such as sorghum, millet, yams, sweet potatoes, soybean and pumpkin leaves among many others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the recently concluded Africa-wide Food Technology workshop held in Nairobi, Kenya from June 24 to 29, participants emphasised that growth in food production within the African region has been lower than population growth over the past two to three decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Actual per capita food and energy intake levels declined over the same period. A second significant problem contributing to declining food availability in the African region is the post-harvest loss of food to rats, insects, fungus, etc.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A third important cause of decreased availability of food has been the shift from traditional crops in Africa. A 1994 World Bank document observed that the per capita consumption of products like cassava had declined by as much as 50 per cent during the period 1961 to 1991. In the same period however, the per capita consumption of &quot;foreign&quot; crops like wheat had increased by as much as 35 to 50 per cent. In Botswana, traditionally a sorghum country, the consumption of maize has outstripped that of sorghum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the food technology workshop, it was emphasised that if Africa was to get out of the current food deficit gap, Africans will have to go back to their indigenous crops that are well adapted to the region such as sorghum, millet, cassava and yams. The food scientists lamented that research programmes had not given adequate priority to these crops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Dr. Omozoje Ohiokpehai, National Project Coordinator of the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) training programme for women entrepreneurs in food processing based in Botswana, many African nations could learn from the experience of the South African nation which took decisive steps to produce a traditional cereal based food substitute for its children. The cereal, tsabana, caught on so well that adults began to eat it as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With a population of 1.4 million people, Botswana suffers incessant drought problems. Crop production was seriously affected, particularly from 1982 to 1987, necessitating the importation of large quantities of food into Botswana by donor agencies and commercial importers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The donations were being gradually phased out when the government of Botswana started to prepare for the development of a weaning food to replace previously donated soya milk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A task force was set up to oversee the activities of the project coordinated by the Ministry of Health with the participation of other ministries including Finance and Planning, Agriculture and the Botswana Technology Research Service. A United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and World Food programme (WFP) consultant was attached to the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The American consultant recommended the use of maize and soya in the mixture but quite wisely, the government of Botswana insisted on using sorghum. Consequently several mixtures were made and the most successful turned out to be red sorghum plus soya at the ration of three parts of red sorghum to one of soya flour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mixture went through rigorous research before a local company, Foods Botswana, was engaged to produce tsabana commercially.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Tsabana provides 42 per cent energy, 98 per cent protein and 100 per cent vitamin needs of infants in the (age) range between four and 36 months,&quot; says Dr. Ohiokpehai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tsabana is distributed free of charge from clinics once a month. During drought years, up to 80 per cent of the children are fed on tsabana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation with a population of more than 100 million people, is also paying attention to the development of infant foods based on traditional crops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Olatunji of the Federal Institute of Industrial Research (FIIRO) at Oshodi near the capital, Lagos says a number of commercial food items on the market in Nigeria are the result of local research efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Staple foods like gari and fufu are predominantly energy (carbohydrate) foods with less than two per cent protein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Gari is a convenient ready-to-eat food that can be soaked in water and eaten as a meal especially now that the majority cannot afford protein rich foods,&quot; says Dr. Olatunji.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In order to make it suitable for the growing child, the FIIRO and the Ibadan-based International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) have succeeded in blending it with locally produced soy flour to make soy-gari with a protein content of 10 to 14 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For weaning infants, Olatunji and his colleagues at FIIRO have developed the Ogi-soy based on traditional cereals that have undergone partial fermentation to further boost nutritional and storage properties. Mass production of the product relies on the use of locally made machinery for milling and drying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. A.C. Mosha of the Gaberone Technology Centre says the process of fermentation - for example of porridge in gourds - is one of the oldest food preservation technologies in Africa. &quot;In addition, fermentation is known to contribute to the flavour and nutritional richness of the food,&quot; he explains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Studies have shown that the fermentation process has significant positive effects on the nutritional quality of root/cereal porridge preparation. The protein there-in is rendered more digestible while some minerals like iron become more assimilable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Kenya, scientists at the Kenya Industrial Research and Development Institute (KIRDI) have produced a nutritious fermented porridge suitable for children called uji. It is available in supermarkets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The KIRDI has also developed techniques for censuring absolute hygienic production, particularly in order to ensure that aflatoxin, a harmful fungus does not thrive in a product.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - In May this year, the General Secretary of the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC), Rev. Jose Chipenda, challenged churches in Africa to consider seriously ways and means that can boost self- reliance in their operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Angolan clergy raised this concern against the background that funds that used to flow smoothly to churches in Africa for pastoral programmes from the &quot;mother&quot; Church mainly in Europe are dwindling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The wells are somehow drying up and we need to think seriously about possible alternatives for the church in Africa,&quot; Rev. Chipenda, told some 100 delegates who from May 21 to 22 met at Limuru on the outskirts of the capital, Nairobi to deliberate on Self-Reliance in the African Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But like other theologians, who have spoken on the issue before, Rev.  Chipenda was quick to acknowledge that &quot;the kind of self- reliance we are talking about, would not be achieved easily.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Mr. MacMillan Kiiru, who coordinated the church consultation, churches in Africa, would have to think seriously about being good stewards and managers of what God has already endowed them with.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Many times, we have gone astray in managing what we have been generously given by others for God's work on our continent. We therefore have to think seriously how we can take care of what God has given other people to give to us for His work on our continent, before we move to the next step of becoming self-supporting,&quot; he argues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Kiiru, who has in the past conducted various consultations, workshops and meetings on stewardship and management for church leaders and workers in various parts of Africa, notes; &quot;Sometimes churches, like other institutions, such as governments, have become victims of corruption and mismanagement, giving a bad name to the Church.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commenting on the same subject, Dr. Mercy Oduyoye from Ghana, formerly deputy Secretary-General of the World Council of Churches (WCC), says; &quot;Let us not fuss about it. We have to make it work for time is overdue. While the missionaries have comfortably supported us in the past, we need to stand on our own feet today. We have gone many miles away from being heavily dependent on our &quot;mother&quot; church in Europe for financial needs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;While we were children, we behaved like them (children) but when we grew up, we behaved like adults, so says the Bible. And likewise, we should now accept to stand on our own feet, since the early missionaries did everything for us when we were toddlers spiritually,&quot; pointed out Mrs (Dr) Hannah Kinoti, a lecturer at the department of Religious Studies, University of Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prof. Patrick Matsikenyiri, a Zimbabwean teaching music and culture at the Methodist Church University in Mutare, emphasized on the need to talk more about self sufficiency; &quot;We still have a number of 'doubting Thomases' who need preaching on the need to be self- supporting; a reality that the entire church in Africa should hear about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Teresia Hinga, a Kenyan, who lectures at the DePaul University in the USA cautions that &quot;the same Europe that has generously helped churches in Africa to pursue their pastoral programmes in the past, is today paying greater financial attention to the new foundland in the Eastern Europe after the collapse of Communism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former Presiding Methodist Bishop in Kenya, Lawi Imathiu says; &quot;We simply need to urge the Church in Africa to move one or two steps up. We are not at a zero point in this aspect. We have already taken off the ground. One only needs to look around in Kenya for example, where Christians raise alot of money through harambees (kiswahili - pooling resources to meet a common need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In our churches for example, there are times when, we have raised more money in a given period than what is received from our church donors in Europe,&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Douglas Waruta, a lecturer in religious studies at the University of Nairobi proposes a structural overhaul for the Church in Africa if self-reliance is to be realised on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have built our Christian faith on structures that are too expensive to run. We might have to overhaul some of them to enable local churches to stand on their own feet,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing the May consultation, former Moderator of the Presbyterian Church of East Africa (PCEA), Rt. Rev. John Gatu said self-reliance, must take the form of the Exodus Experience. The Hebrews in Egypt, could not appreciate the leadership of Moses or Aaron and many others of their own kith and kin until they left Egypt, he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unless the African leadership accept the challenge of self-reliance in order to undo the yoke of dependence and be able to set examples in training personnel, trusting one another regardless of the evils of ethnicity that seem to have raided not only Africa but the entire world today, the Church in Africa will remain poor, weak and will be unable to engage in her missionary calling to evangelize to all mankind, Rev. Gatu pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former PCEA Moderator pointed out that self-reliance should not only be seen in terms of financial stability. &quot;It also embraces the total life of the Church to be able to become the real Church of Jesus Christ, commissioned to carry the message to the utmost parts of the earth,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rev. Gatu also had some advice for church leaders. For churches in Africa to achieve the intended goal of self-reliance, the church leaders will have to &quot;strip themselves naked&quot; before the Lord in terms of allowing Jesus to deal with their spirituality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He further suggested that the same church leaders will also have to &quot;strip themselves&quot; of the comfort of salaries and benefits received from their relationships with overseas donors, and allow Jesus to direct the operation instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his paper, Economic Challenges Facing the Church in Africa, a senior lecturer at the Institute of Diplomacy and International Studies, University of Nairobi, Dr Gerrishon Ikiara, told the consultation participants that while demands on the Church in Africa have been rising rapidly, the ability of the Church to provide or supply the required services has been hampered by various factors, among them, inflationary pressures, economic stagnation, poor tithing and other church collections, lack of business acumen by church leaders, bureaucratic or government obstacles and the dependency syndrome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While it is said that the high rate of Christianity growth being experienced in Africa is a blessing in terms of the spread of the Word of God, Dr. Ikiara warned that &quot;there are inescapable financial costs that are associated with this growth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He cited the need for upgrading and infrastructure that the church operates in, church buildings, schools, hospitals etc; the impact of socio-economic crises, rapidly worsening poverty situation, the refugees, new epidemics such as the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), involvement of churches in the democratisation process and the creation of new social-economic institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his book, Hope for Africa and What the Christian Can Do, Kenyan scholar, George Kinoti, argues that &quot;our extensive dependence on the Western Church for ideas, theology, personnel and money is unhealthy for the Church in Africa and unhelpful to the African people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And this is true whether the imports come from liberal, evangelical, Pentecostal or some other Western source, says Kinoti, adding, that the dangers of mistaking Western culture, philosophy and psychology for Christianity are not sufficiently recognised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishop Njeru Wambugu, the head of the National Independent Church of Africa (NIPA) in Kenya, sees the move by the mission-oriented churches in Africa to aim for self-reliance in their pastoral programmes as a clear sign that &quot;they (churches) have realised the right gospel -- that they need to stand on their own feet, not only financially, but in other areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He reminds them of the famous Kiswahili saying, &quot;Mwacha Mila ni Mtumwa&quot; (One who fails to live up to his/her culture remains a slave).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - As African leaders met for their annual summit in Yaounde, Cameroon, fears were fast rising that another ethnic bloodbath would erupt in Burundi amid calls for African peacekeeping troops to be sent into the impoverished, tiny former Belgian colony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The spectra of a repeat of the savage violence which tore Rwanda apart two years ago was top of the agenda for the 53-nation Organisation of African Unity (OAU) at their three-day summit in Yaounde.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burundi's low-level civil war between extremists from the Hutu majority and the minority Tutsi-dominated army threatens to degenerate into carnage as moves to find a peaceful solution founder amid escalating ethnic hatred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Providing security to the country of 5.5 million people, however, ran into difficulty early this month when its Tutsi prime minister and Hutu president fell out publicly over what role an international peacekeeping force would play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burundi's neighbours, fearing unrest could spill over into their territory, had suggested a force composed initially of troops from Ethiopia, Tanzania and Uganda, but the OAU has yet to decide how it will be financed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Countries bordering Burundi and Rwanda are afraid an explosion of violence, similar to the ethnic violence in Rwanda in 1994 when between 500,000 and one million people were reported to have been killed, could engulf the entire Great Lakes region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Plans to send African troops to strife-torn Burundi foundered on July 3 when President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, a Hutu and Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo, a Tutsi disagreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The split came as Hutu rebels accused the Tutsi-dominated army of having killed more than 1,000 Hutu civilians the previous week with the aid of Tutsi soldiers from neighbouring Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Council for the Defence of Democracy (CNDD), the biggest rebel group, said in a communique issued in Brussels, Belgium, that the soldiers, with &quot;massive back-up&quot; from Rwandan troops, had massacred more than 1,000 Hutu civilians in the north- western province of Cibitoke on June 27 and demanded an international inquiry into the alleged bloodbath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No independent confirmation of any massacre has been obtained, as no international organisation has been working in Cibitoke since the assassination of three Red Cross delegates there on June 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But an army spokesman in Bujumbura said on radio that &quot;not one Rwandan soldier has set foot in Burundi to help us,&quot; and in Kigali, a senior Rwandan Defence Ministry official dismissed the allegation as &quot;nonsense....propaganda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president and prime minister had joined other regional leaders at a summit in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha on June 25 to seek military assistance, but Nduwayo on July 3 accused the president of wanting to &quot;neutralise&quot; the army, which is battling Hutu rebels in the conflict, whose casualties were mostly civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both men returned from the summit to accusations of treachery and back-pedalled fast, saying the force would be under Burundian command, with its missions defined by the Burundian military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the OAU Council of Ministers' draft resolution to the summit expressed strong support for a regional conference on peace, security, stability and development in the Great Lakes region, although ironically Rwanda, which has been a main topic for the last two OAU summits, was skipped from a list of countries to be discussed this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is in apparent response to Rwandan officials who, at a meeting of foreign ministers laying the summit groundwork, objected to being bunched together with states such as Burundi, saying everything was normal in their own country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a rapporteur's report from the ministers meeting on July 5, Rwandan Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana, stressed that the problems of Rwanda and Burundi which have the same ethnic make-up of 85 per cent Hutus and 14 per cent Tutsis, should not be confused as they were &quot;different&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Expressing grave concern at the deteriorating situation in Burundi where Hutu rebels opposed to sharing power with the influential Tutsi minority are fighting an escalating guerrilla war, the African ministers expressed support for a peace initiative undertaken by Tanzania's elder statesman, former President Julius Nyerere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The resolution &quot;strongly supported the important (peace initiative) of Nyerere&quot; and urged the country's political leadership, the military and the civilians to show a greater will for a negotiated and peaceful settlement to their conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, the ministers deplored the continuing bloodshed in this tiny Central African state, saying: &quot;The OAU Council of Ministers deplores and strongly condemns the brutal and bastardly murder of innocent people as well as humanitarian and aid workers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> United States envoys had also warned recently in Bujumbura against any coup d'etat after Tutsi extremists said that the arrival of foreign troops would unleash a full-scale civil war, with Tutsis forming guerrilla bands after accusing Ntibatunganya of being in cahoots with the Hutu rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two US negotiators, special peace envoy to Burundi Howard Wolpe and US special coordinator for Burundi and neighbouring Rwanda Richard Bogosian, said they fully supported the appeal for military assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Belgian envoy Yves Haesendonck also expressed support for an African force after talks in Bujumbura with Ntibantunganya. Belgium administered Burundi under League of Nations and UN mandates from 1919 to 1962.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Liberia, the ministers warned the warring faction leaders that the OAU would recommend imposition of severe UN sanctions on them, including the possibility of setting up a war crime tribunal to try faction leaders on gross human rights violations, if the next meeting of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) on Liberia was a failure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other conflicts up for discussion included Angola, Sierra Leone and Somalia, which have left Africa with millions dead and refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A total of 19 draft resolutions were presented for debate by OAU heads of state and government at the summit, hosted by Cameroon from July 8 to 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> High among the draft resolutions is the deadly Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and its spread, which casts a long shadow over the proceedings of the pan-African body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The resolutions called for more international assistance to fight AIDS, which affects Africa more than any other continent, with statistics showing that some 11 million out of the 18 million people in the world infected with the HIV virus, the precursor to AIDS, are found in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The number of draft resolutions was, however, slashed by half from the original 38 to 19, with Rwanda being one of those to be dropped, according to a copy of the draft resolutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among them was their decision to give their support to UN Secretary- General Boutros-Ghali to seek a second final term as head of the world body, despite vehement opposition by the United States that has pledged to support any other African candidate, but not Boutros- Ghali, an Egyptian national.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ministers, whose countries, have a total external debt expected to reach 320 billion dollars this year, also renewed the mandate of a sub-committee tasked with finding ways of resolving the burden of external debt. The continent's increasing indebtedness and debt- servicing have led to a deterioration of socio-economic conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ministers also deplored the attitude of France, United States and Britain towards Libya which is under UN sanctions because of its alleged involvement in terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Algeria and Mauritania called for the OAU to implement UN resolutions on a referendum on self-determination for the Sahara. The question has been a bone of contention between Algeria and Morocco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conspicuously absent from the list of resolutions was the Bakassi peninsula conflict between the conference hosts, Cameroon and neighbouring Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at the end of the Council of Ministers' session, OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim summed up Africa's troubled situation with a warning that the continent's hope on Burundi lay in the ongoing peace efforts by former Tanzanian leader, Julius Nyerere, although these efforts were apparently being rejected by the country's opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The renewed clashes between Liberian clans and Somalia's factions respectively, have been equally frustrating, Salim said, pointing out: &quot;The untold and extreme suffering and hardship imposed on the people of Liberia defies all description and reason.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The tragedy in Somalia continues to haunt the international community,&quot; said Salim, adding that the sporadic fighting and humanitarian crisis continued to pose a serious challenge to the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the London-based human rights watchdog, Amnesty International (AI), commended OAU for giving priority to the Burundi conflict, warning that the worst could still come unless the OAU provided bold leadership to the international community on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amnesty's warning comes as ordinary Burundians were becoming more and more cynical on the possibility of success of current regional efforts to resolve the Burundian ethnic debacle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AI notes that it was at Arusha that a peace treaty for Rwanda was signed in 1993, eight months before the outbreak of the civil war there which saw Hutu extremists slaughter more than 500,000 men, women and children, most of them minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Durham, NC - Previewing what could be intense Olympic competition between athletes from Africa and the United States, South African sprinter Hezekiel Sepeng bested American Johnny Gray in a down-to-the-wire 800 meters race during the &quot;Gold Rush&quot; track-and-field meet here on Saturday.<BR> Vida Nsiash of Ghana came in first in the women's 100-meter hurdles, and South African Joha Morapedi won the men's 3,000 meters in the only other top finishes for African athletes in the meet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the women's 1,500 meters, South African Gwen Griffiths lost a close race to American Stephanie Best, a non-Olympian who bested U.S. teams members Lynn Jennings (3rd) and Kate Fonshell (4th).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The competition was held at Duke University, which has a track very similar to the one that will be used for the Atlanta Games, and was the final pre-Olympic test for the participants.<BR> For his victorious run, Sepeng set a stadium record of 1:43:47 and posted the third fastest time in the world this year. Gray finished third at 1:43:96, the fastest for an American this year, behind Einars Tupuritis of Latvia. Nsiash's winning time in the 100 meter hurdles was 13:57.<BR> A large crowd of more than 28,000, most of whom remained in the stadium in spite a brief but heavy downpour, was deprived of seeing one highly touted U.S.-African match-up. South African pole vaulter Okkert Brits, a leading world contender, was a 'no-show,' leaving that event to the top American, Lawrence Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A large South African contingent did take part, with South African men chalked up third place finishes in the 4x400 meter relay and in the 300 meter steeplechase (Shadrak Mogosti), the 1500 meters (Johan Botha) and the 400-meter hurdles (Llewellyn Herbert).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lofti Khaida from Algeria placed fourth in the triple jump and fifth in the long jump, which was won by American Carl Lewis, a three-time Olympic gold medalist. Two African runners placed in the men's 100 meters, Abdul Zakari of Ghana (12th) and Jean-Oliver Zirignon of Cote d'Ivoire (14th).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meet was organized by Duke track coach Al Buehler and Dr. LeRoy T.  Walker, a Durham resident and president of the United States Olympic Committee. The two men have teamed up to bring a series of major meets to this city over the past two decades, including two with strong Pan-African representation in 1971 and 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Walker, a long-time track coach at North Carolina Central University in Durham who coached the U.S. Olympic team in 1976, trained 12 U.S. medal winners and numerous African champions, including Kenya's 4x400 gold medal team at the 1972 Munich Games.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Foreign zoos are reluctant to buy lions captured in the Kruger National Park because new research shows eight out of every 10 Kruger lions may be infected with the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), a viral agent similar in structure to HIV but not transferable between human and cat species.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Research conducted by biologists and veterinarians on a sample of lions drawn from all regions of the park shows 80% responded positively to tests for FIV.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is no evidence the virus has caused an outbreak of FAIDS (Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency) -- the cat world's equivalent of full-blown Aids -- or any other symptoms of fatal infectious diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A research report published in the Onderstepoort Journal of Veterinary Research shows antibodies indicating the presence of FIV -- or a virus closely related to that which afflicts domestic cats -- were found in the vast majority of male and female lions that were captured, sedated and tested during the two-year study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A comparative survey on a sample of lions from the Etosha National Park in Namibia found no evidence of FIV. However, epidemiological studies have established that 57% of lions sampled in European zoos and 73% of Asian lions at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago also have the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although there is little evidence FIV in lions causes any serious pathological consequences, some zoos in North America say they will not buy lions from Kruger because it is unlikely they will pass obligatory Faids tests with a clean bill of health. The disease does not, however, affect the park's ability to sell wild lions to other game reserves in South Africa as FIV is not listed as a &quot;notifiable disease&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Ever wondered why the beast roaring out of the screen at the start of every MGM movie doesn't really look like the cats you see in the Kruger National Park? It is because the ferocious lion with a long black mane which features so often in popular iconography is now extinct in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Or is it? Eleven animals which look remarkably like the magnificent Cape or Barbary lions -- subspecies resembling the near-mythical &quot;biblical lion&quot; that is thought to have died out in Africa decades ago -- have been &quot;discovered&quot; by a South African researcher at a forgotten zoo in Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hym Ebedes, specialist wildlife researcher at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute, spotted a group of lions with distinctive long, wide black manes that reach under their bellies at a zoo in Addis Ababa during a research expedition into Ethiopia's wilderness areas late last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The scientist says the male cats in the pride, descendants of a group of lions kept by Emperor Haile Selassie at the royal palace in Addis before he was toppled in a 1974 coup, have the physical features of the North African Barbary lion or South Africa's Cape lion. Both were shot out of existence by white hunters and settlers during the colonial period.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Over the past 35 years I have seen hundreds of wild lions in game reserves, lots of captive lions in zoos all over the world, as well as photographs of lions in wildlife books from all over southern, western and eastern Africa, but I had never before seen anything so impressive, majestic and magnificient,&quot; Ebedes told the Mail &amp; Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The sight of a black-maned lion pacing around his cage just before feeding time in a zoo in Addis Ababa last October had an indescribable spine-chilling effect on me. This animal was exactly as I had always visualised and pictured the Cape lion, which became extinct about 150 years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barbary lions from the Atlas Mountain region in present-day Morocco were imported from North Africa into the Roman Empire. They were used in gladiator contests and featured in legendary accounts of Christians being persecuted by the Romans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The last of the North African animals was shot dead in the Atlas region during the 1920s. Their ferocious features and beautiful black manes appear frequently in Greek mythology, biblical literature (the lions of Judea and the animal that Samson killed with the jaw of an ass), popular Western iconography (MGM movies and Simba cartoons), as well as the folklore of many African cultures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Cape lions, which had a strong resemblance to their North African cousins, were hunted by colonial farmers in the 19th century and were thought to have become extinct in the 1850s. Cape (Leo melanochaitus) and Barbary (Leo leo leo) lions -- each a subspecies of the same cat family (Panthera leo) -- probably developed similar features because cool winter climates and the absence of dense bush on each tip of the continent allowed their manes to grow longer than other types of African lions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A 19th century account describes males of the extinct Cape lion as having &quot;large manes that reach far behind the shoulders; belly mane developed; the yellowish colour of the mane around the face contrasts sharply with the blackish, or pure black colouring of their mane on the neck, shoulders, throat and chest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are three male lions, four lionesses and four cubs in the Ethiopian zoo. Mystery surrounds their history and presence in the East African country. It is known that they came from the private collection of Hailie Selassie, whose dynasty called itself the Lions of Ethiopia and always kept the wild cats to help cultivate its image of power.<BR>The last of the Selassie families was overthrown in a military coup and was replaced by the Marxist government of Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1974. The lions were transferred to the zoo in Addis Ababa. Ebedes is the first Western veterinary scientist to have visited the zoo since the dictatorship was replaced in the early 1990s by an elected government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Given their enthusiasm for collecting lions, it is possible that Selassie obtained the animals from a private collector or a zoo in Europe that had, in turn, acquired them from the Cape or North Africa before these types of lion became extinct,&quot; says Ebedes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Selassie is dead, while Mariam is living in exile in Zimbabwe. Ebedes has consulted Ethiopian historians to see if they know how the lions came to Addis, but these inquiries have drawn a blank. He says the best way to begin unravelling the riddle is to conduct comparative genetic tests on the live Addis animals and the skins of Barbary and Cape lions that exist in European museums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Petri Viljoen, a biologist who specialises in research into the genetic features of South African lions, says the Ethiopian discovery offers intriguing prospects for breeding and possibly reintroducing into the wild a species that has disappeared from record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he warns that the excitement in zoological circles is based, so far, only on the physical characteristics of the animals found in Addis. Viljoen says captive lions are known to develop large torsos and long manes because they do not have to hunt in hot and dense bush. This, rather than genetic membership of a subspecies, could explain the physical characteristics of the Ethiopian lions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Professor Fritz Eloff, renowned for his research into the lions of the Kalahari desert, says he has studied video footage taken by Ebedes of the Ethiopian pride. &quot;I have seen lions from all over Africa, but never such lions. They look exactly like the pictures and sketches of the Cape lion that I have seen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eloff says DNA analysis is the only way to determine whether the Ethiopian lions come from the two extinct types of African cats. &quot;The other important question that needs to be answered is, where the lions come from?  Are they Ethiopian lions, or do they come from further north -- for example, from Morocco?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eloff says there are records of lions that resembled the extinct Barbary lions living at a zoo in Rabat, Morocco, during the 1970s. He agrees that private collectors in Europe may have kept Cape or Barbary lions and then supplied the offspring to the Selassie family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vratislav Mazak, a European zoologist and lion specialist, reports that the Cape lion was the first of the African subspecies to become extinct. It died out too soon for scientists to study it properly -- making it difficult to compare it to the pride in the Addis zoo. Mazak's scientific reports say there are only eight mounted skins in natural history museums in England, the Netherlands, France and Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the owners of the Kapama private game reserve in South Africa are negotiating with the Ethiopian government to buy some of the Ethiopian lions and bring them back to this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ebedes has suggested the Cape Public Works authorities rehabilitate the historical lion enclosure at the old zoo at the Rhodes Memorial in Cape Town so that it can house these animals which strongly resemble the legendary cats who once roamed freely on the slopes of Table Mountain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - Give him a wig and black silk gown, and Napolean Agbedetse could have walked back into the south London courtrooms where he used to practise as a barrister. He is on the bank of the Abadino river, deep inside the mosquito-infested mangrove swamps of the Niger delta. Despite the shirt-soaking humidity, Agbedetse is immaculately dressed in a heavy black pinstripe suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Standing on the jetty amid a welter of gawking young boys, he cuts an incongruous figure as he courteously greets representatives of the Shell oil company and prepares, yet again, to do verbal battle on behalf of the Omadino people. This is only one of the hundreds of remote rural communities in Nigeria who feel they are being cheated out of their birthright by foreign oil companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This issue has rarely been out of the headlines since the country's military government late last year outraged international opinion by proceeding with the hanging of environmental activist Ken Saro-Wiwa -- a campaigner for the the Ogoni people, who live in the east of the delta.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shell, which operates a consortium responsible for drilling more than half the country's oil reserves, has been widely criticised for not doing more to oppose the execution. Shell is perceived by many in the West to have huge influence with the authorities as oil now accounts for as much as 90% of the government's revenue. But within the subsistence-level fishing communities like the Omadinos near the oil town of Warri, anger is steadily growing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month, 60 protesters forced Shell to shut down its drilling rig in nearby Jones Creek -- the latest of a string of incidents throughout the Niger basin, where local communities' dissatisfaction has boiled over into direct action against Shell activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Six million people live in this 70 000km2 province. These are rural communities, eking out their living from the brown waters of the Niger and its fast-running tributaries snaking out across a massive expanse of rain forest and mangrove swamp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But their living standards have plummeted: wildlife is scarce, and fish yields are down. How much this is due to the pressures of population growth, lack of land management or oil industry-related pollution depends on which lobbyists you listen to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All of which raises the question of to what extent any international company operating in a deprived country should be held responsible for functions which are, or should be, the preserve of the national government.  In the case of Nigeria, the debate is clouded still further by the failure of the national government to redistribute hefty oil revenues to the producing areas, and by the myriad local tribal tensions which make it almost impossible to get an accurate assessment of the views of local people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet the debate that took place last week between Agbedetse and Shell's local general manager, Steve Ollerearnshaw, in front of an audience of villagers down the Abadino river does, in simplified form, highlight the underlying conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although he had cut out a career for himself as a British-based barrister, Agbedetse says that he was driven by his conscience to return to help his native Itsekiri tribe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Waiting until the contingent from Shell has sat down in the corrugated tin-roofed meeting hall, Agbedetse drops to his knee before Chief Sunday and the other tribal elders, some wearing bowler hats and all seated at differing heights to reflect their varying degrees of seniority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Waiting until his guests have been served Star beer or cola, he lulls them into a false sense of security, praising Shell for its &quot;sheer hard work&quot; which has &quot;opened up the unknown hidden wealth of our country&quot;. And then he turns the knife. Listened to attentively by dozens of stony-faced villagers, Agbedetse accuses Shell of &quot;dictatorship&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;On paper, they dialogue with the community on what developments are needed, but in reality Shell operatives dictate what they want, irrespective of the needs of the people,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not only do communities like the Omadino get little back from local oil exploration, but also Shell, he asserts, is decimating the region's staple occupation of fishing, through oil spills. He adds: &quot;The plight of those of us in the rural operation areas is one of depression, neglect and poverty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As they sit in their green overalls, several Shell officials have clearly heard this all before. Ollerearnshaw gets to his feet, pointing out that the company has given the community a block of classrooms and public toilets and will shortly be donating a health centre -- the latest items from Shell's $30-million-a-year community assistance programme for the Niger delta region. A further $100-million is allocated for the environment annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He tries to raise the point that Shell is a company, and cannot take on all the functions of central government. But one angry young man, wearing blue and white robes, attempts to hijack the meeting, angrily shouting that the company must do more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Back in Nigeria's capital city, Lagos, the company's managing director Brian Anderson admits that adverse publicity surrounding its involvement in Nigeria has been &quot;very bad&quot; for the company's image, particularly the controversy surrounding the Saro-Wiwa hanging. But Shell insists that the situation in the Niger delta is far more complex, and Anderson claims that its influence on the hardline national government is far less than the West supposes it to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shell's stance is that it is, after all, a commercial company with a 30% stake in a consortium in which the state-owned Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation has a majority holding. The group, which includes Elf of France and Italy's Agip, pumps more than half of Nigeria's output of two million barrels a day, giving the country oil revenues worth $7-billion, of which the government keeps 75%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least 3% of this revenue should flow back to the people of the oil-producing areas, according to the terms of a government decree. This is to increase to 13%, although the higher figure has yet to be ratified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In practice, it appears that government aid has all but broken down, and Shell says that the administration is in arrears with its payments. That puts even more pressure on the funds Shell and its other partners have for community projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The problem is that for many of the rural inhabitants of the Niger Delta, Shell has effectively become the government. It may protest that it does not aspire to become a 21st century version of the East India Company; yet the more it seeks to pacify local people by taking over the role of building hospitals and providing schools, the more it replaces Nigeria's military dictatorship as a target for civil dissent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And yet Shell has been extracting oil here for 50 years. It may play the role of the community-minded Western oil company, but why is it only now making such a fanfare about its perfectly laudable programmes to replant the mangrove swamps and bury its pipelines if not to improve its public image?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of course attitudes change, but Shell cannot ignore the fact that it has drained billions of dollars of profits out of Nigeria during the past five decades. Its payback to the community has hardly been consistent over that period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And as with all oil explorers, it has inevitably contributed to the pollution of the environment, although there is no obvious sign of any significant spillage within its operating areas in the delta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Shell is now having to pay in full. It has played such a pivotal role in Nigeria's economy that it must bear some responsibility when the going gets rough. But the company's predicament may be useful, too, for Nigeria's leader, General Sani Abacha: the controversy diverts attention from the country's fundamental problem -- the corruption and inefficiency in its own military government.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bujumbura - There is a difference of opinion in Burundi about the cement factory manager who burnt 22 of his workers to death, and sold tickets to their fellow employees to watch. The manager is a Tutsi, his victims were Hutus. Today there are many in Burundi's capital, Bujumbura, who refuse to condemn him. Some even argue that the killings were a blow against genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On a typical day, 100 people are killed in Burundi. In the three years since it began, the death toll has risen to over 100 000. Most are not killed in conventional combat. The Hutu rebels and Tutsi army, backed by their militias in the cities, rarely confront one another. Mostly they attack those unable to resist. Each side accuses the other of genocide. Each has a point.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Genocide haunts the nations dotted around Lake Tanganyika. Rwanda witnessed the swiftest and most comprehensive mass murder of modern times.  Survivors and witnesses are still being killed to prevent them telling what they know. In the refugee camps in Zaire and Tanzania -- where the West feeds and protects the killers -- the genocide hangs over the guilty and innocent alike, imbuing a fear of retribution that keeps two million people from going home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But today the fear of genocide lives most openly in Burundi where it is used to justify mass murder, and where it threatens to kindle a larger war that could engulf the whole region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two weeks ago, faced with an escalating death toll, a war it cannot win and an economy close to collapse, Burundi's government bowed to pressure from its neighbours to accept foreign troops on its soil in an effort to quell the killing. The shape and mandate of the intervention force is to be decided by regional leaders who believe more than Burundi's future is at stake. If the nation descends into full-scale civil war, it is likely to drag Rwanda into the fray, plunge eastern Zaire into conflict and possibly embroil Uganda and Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dawn chorus in Bujumbura is provided by the young Tutsis singing as they jog through the capital. Gripping sticks and Kalashnikovs, they are members of the &quot;civil defence units&quot; formed over the past few weeks at the Tutsi prime minister's behest after Hutu rebel attacks on the electricity supply shattered the illusion of security created by ethnic cleansing. They are reminiscent of the youths who pounded Rwanda's streets before the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dilapidated heart of Bujumbura bustles for a few hours a day with citizens in a hurried search for necessities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some fear to walk the streets, especially close to the market, a target for random grenade attacks. The 9pm curfew killed Bujumbura's nightlife.  Power cuts occur daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most people prefer to get home by dusk and huddle in homes tucked into the hillsides sloping down to the edge of Lake Tanganyika. Even there, the war encroaches. Fishing boats are no longer permitted to scour the lake -- an attempt to prevent weapons being shipped across the water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the government first tried to enforce the curfew, the joke was that it applied to Hutus and foreigners. But that could not allay the growing sense of fear among Tutsis. So the army decided the Hutus had to go all together. Kamenge, a large township in the capital, was the first to be cleared with the enthusiastic assistance of the Tutsi militias. Its houses were wrecked in the army raids and its people massacred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Certainly there was some support for the rebel cause. The Kamenge malcontents were run by a young man known as &quot;Savimbi&quot; who was as much into organised crime as liberation. But when it came to driving township residents out, the army did not discriminate between guilty and innocent, men and women, young and old. They left behind hundreds of dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the Hutus forced out tramped into the nearby hills. Some still venture into the city in the mornings to sell food. Bujumbura needs the supplies, so they are tolerated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it is outside the capital where the real terror lies, and where the scale of murder is overshadowed only by its routine brutality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Typical of the military's contribution to the murderous cycle was the massacre of at least 70 Hutu civilians in hills around Gitega a fortnight ago. Witnesses said six truckloads of soldiers armed with guns and bayonets drew up. Over five hours they hunted down their victims across four hills. A survivor described seeing men, women and children shot or bayonetted and their bodies tossed in a river.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Hutu rebels respond in kind. Last week, they murdered as many as 100 people at Burundi's largest tea plantation, about 50km from the capital. They claimed that the only victims were soldiers. But of the 22 bodies I saw outside the factory, 16 were women and children. Some were babies, their skulls crushed even as they clutched their mothers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If there is no intervention by the international community -- very tough and very rapid intervention -- the conflict is going to get worse and it will not only affect Burundi. It will have a direct impact on Rwanda, Zaire, Uganda and even Tanzania. The whole Great Lakes subregion will burn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This prediction was made by Jean-Marie Ngendahayo, Burundi's former foreign minister, who fled to South Africa. The warnings have sounded ever since Rwanda erupted in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African elder statesman Julius Nyerere, UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Jimmy Carter, senior American officials and Tanzania's President Benjamin Mkapa have all warned that Burundi is perilously close to the edge. &quot;There is an almost frantic amassing of weapons of all kinds by each group. We must not let a replay of the 1994 Rwanda tragedy take place,&quot; Mkapa said at the regional summit two weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former American ambassador to Burundi, Robert Krueger, fired a parting shot in an official cable before his reappointment to Botswana, probably for being too outspoken in his demands for Western action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He drew a comparison with the Oklahoma bombing. In proportion to its size, Burundi is suffering a death toll equivalent to that at Oklahoma each day, but few take notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'This cable is a reminder that in an obscure country in the heart of Africa, the killing is proportionately vastly heavier than what the cameras are covering; or, indeed, than in almost any place else in the world,&quot; he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Boutros-Ghali's appeals to the UN Security Council for an international force for Burundi have fallen on deaf ears. The memories are fresh of the US's debacle in Somalia under UN auspices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rwanda provided an unmitigated UN failure which counted among its victims the deaths of Belgian peacekeepers beside the hundreds of thousands of Tutsis. So far as the UN is concerned, Africa will have to look after itself.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Revelations that South Africa continues to import hazardous chemical material -- even though the Cabinet has assured the public it will ban such consignments -- appears to have thrown government policy on the international toxic waste trade into confusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Green Party politicians in the European Parliament this week informed local environmentalists that Pretoria's embassy in Brussels had acknowledged South Africa still imports &quot;hazardous waste for recycling from a number of countries in the region&quot; and that its government was reluctant to endorse clauses in the Lome Convention that would outlaw this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If true, this would fly in the face of repeated commitments by former environment minister Dawie de Villiers that the government would not allow industrial waste from other countries into this country. The African National Congress, along with its labour allies in the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), have also adopted official policy against the import of industrial waste.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet officials in the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) were this week unable to supply the Mail &amp; Guardian with a coherent explanation for their recent reluctance to accept a ban on movement of wastes between African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. Nor were they willing to provide details about the trade in industrial waste that appears to be continuing in Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A South African negotiating team has recently been in Brussels to negotiate the terms of this country's access to the Lome Convention, which governs trade and development relations between European states and ACP countries, and the Green Party politicians say it was these talks that revealed South Africa is involved in an ongoing trade in industrial poisons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Diplomats from the South African embassy in Brussels reportedly told European officials they were disturbed by sections of Article 39 of the Lome Convention, which stipulates &quot;the ACP states shall prohibit the direct or indirect import into their territory of such waste ... from any other country&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They added that South Africa currently imports waste for recycling from a number of countries in Africa and that a viable industry would be destroyed if Pretoria endorsed this article of the Lome Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John Mare, counsellor at the South African embassy in Brussels, told the M&amp;G the negotiating team had, indeed, been reluctant to endorse the anti-toxic trade clauses of Lome but that this was not a final position. &quot;We are still negotiating the terms of South Africa's entry into the convention and this stance could change. It is a negotiating position and not fixed policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Environmental Justice Networking Forum (EJNF) -- made up of civic, trade union and green organisations in South Africa -- is outraged by the revelations made during the trade talks. The organisation is especially angry because a recent commission of inquiry into the activities of British-owned multinational Thor Chemicals has revealed shipments of overseas toxins into South Africa have caused massive environmental and health damage to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The South African officials are arguing that we have the facilities here to recycle and handle hazardous wastes in a responsible manner,&quot; said Shirley Miller from the Chemical Workers' Industrial Union. &quot;If that is true, then they must show us where that facility exists because we have been looking for some way of dealing with all the toxins that are still stored at Thor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The EJNF has approached Cosatu's executive to take up the issue in a move that could further complicate relations between the labour federation and its old allies now in government -- including Trade and Industry Minister Alec Irwin -- over the Cabinet's new liberal economic policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials in Irwin's ministry and the DTI showed signs of confusion over the issue of importing hazardous materials this week. Repeated requests from the M&amp;G for clarity on the revelations that trade in industrial poisons was still taking place were left unanswered during the last two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DTI officials were also unable to say what kinds of dangerous materials were coming into the country or where they were being recycled or disposed of. The department appears to have inherited the previous government's insistence on bringing dangerous materials into the country while stating publicly it is opposed in principle to these measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa has signed the Basel Convention, which will ban all movements of toxic waste from industrial to developing countries from January 1998 but this international agreement does not prohibit trade in toxins between countries in Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> EJNF officials fear overseas waste is being routed into South Africa via neighbouring states and that DTI officials are reluctant to accept the Lome clauses because they would close this backdoor route for bringing in the lucrative materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile the Green Party in the European Parliament is preparing a resolution that will demand Spanish and British firms who exported tons of mercury toxins still stockpiled at the Thor Chemicals plant in KwaZulu-Natal take the material back and dispose of them in their own country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Contamination from this waste is suspected to have killed three workers and seriously damaged the health of at least 20 others. Soil covering the entire hill where the drums of mercury have been stored is now permeated, to a depth of some 50m, with mercury and underground aquifers show toxic readings that oscillate between 200 and 1700 times the safety levels laid down by the World Health Organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> EJNF co-ordinator Chris Albertyn said: &quot;The Thor tragedy shows that government officials never checked their facts and allowed such material into the country simply because industrialists told them that it would be safely recycled and disposed of. It appears that government officials are still simply the ventriloquist voices of big business.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Threat of exposure at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and in the media was hanging over the head of author Mark Behr when he confessed to having spied for the South African Police at Stellenbosch University in the Eighties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several journalists knew he was a spy prior to his confession last Thursday at a conference in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SABC journalist Jacques Pauw has been planning to include Behr in an upcoming regular Sunday television programme on the truth commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Behr, the award-winning author of The Smell of Apples, was chair of the Stellenbosch branch of the National Union of South African Students (Nusas) in 1988.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Behr never intended confessing to his spy activities at Stellenbosch, believing the issue could be more fully explored in his writing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The truth was so big it could be described better and interrogated better through fiction,&quot; Behr said this week, speaking to the press for the first time since his confession last week. &quot;It is not possible to speak about culpability in a single statement or confession.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Behr is currently working on his second novel, which he says is on the theme of &quot;betrayal&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Behr made his confession only with extreme reluctance, after friends persuaded him the truth would sooner or later come out anyway. He did so in the course of his keynote address to a conference entitled &quot;Faultlines -- inquiries around truth and reconciliation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pearlie Joubert, a close friend of Behr during his student days, said she had known for five years of Behr's spy activities. After the offices of Vrye Weekblad were bombed in 1991, Joubert, then employed by the newspaper, went to make a statement to the police. She recalls that one of the policemen recognised her as a friend of Behr, and told her, &quot;Mark Behr used to work for us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Behr told the Mail &amp; Guardian he started talking to friends about his spying activities shortly after his receipt of the M-Net award for fiction earlier this year turned him into a public figure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;With my novel becoming successful, the likelihood of it (his spy activities) being talked about in public became greater and greater,&quot; Behr said, adding his friends had persuaded him to come clean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One close associate said Behr had been motivated partly by conscience, but also by fear of exposure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I did not speak earlier because I did not know how to begin speaking,&quot; Behr said. &quot;At the beginning, I did not know what to say because it would have been so damaging to Nusas and Sansco (the South African National Students' Congress).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Behr's confession in Cape Town raised more questions than it answered. He left for Norway, where he holds a research post, on sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the telephone from Oslo, Behr would divulge little more, though he said he had promised more details to Pauw for the television documentary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said he had &quot;some non-commissioned rank&quot; in the SAP, but would not say what. He said he reported to the Security Police in Stellenbosch and that the information he passed on was &quot;mostly analytical stuff -- analysis of national politics and how student organisations fitted into that&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked whether his activities had ever caused the arrest of fellow activists, Behr replied, &quot;I don't think so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He would reveal nothing about the nature of his police work at Stellenbosch, and on his claims to have supplied information to the ANC, he would elaborate no further than saying he gave the organisation &quot;bits of information I had access to&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He would not name the member of his family who he says introduced him to the job with the Security Police, and would not reveal whom he reported to either in the Security Police or later in ANC intelligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He hinted he had never been serious about his work for the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;From very early on I realised what I was doing was wrong. I thought I would do less damage if I continued and manipulated the situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Once elected to the Stellenbosch SRC, Behr gained a high profile on campus by organising trips to visit the then-banned ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I thought those things would send signals to the state and to National Party leadership about discontent among white South African youth,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Behr said he was not going to say any more &quot;because of this accusation I am trying to gain the centre stage&quot;. He has been lambasted by former activists for using the conference platform to make his confession, thus drawing attention to himself and creating publicity for his next novel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Behr dismissed this suggestion, saying, &quot;I will be working on the novel for at least two years still.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He believes the scale of his activities does not justify going before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, though he says he will supply information to the commission if requested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Behr's confession is the latest manifestation of a maverick political style which has often aroused the suspicions of his associates. In the paranoid atmosphere of the Eighties, doubts about Behr's agenda went as far as Nusas head office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Head office was suspicious, and acted accordingly,&quot; said Helen Perry, who was Nusas's Western Cape regional organiser in 1989. &quot;We also made it clear to the ANC we were not happy with his security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But nothing was absolutely conclusive -- if there had been, we would have been down on him like a ton of bricks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perry said Behr's over-willingness to have the SRC meet the ANC was among the things that aroused Nusas's suspicions. Nusas's suspicions were widely shared in the Stellenbosch branch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is also unlikely Behr was very effective as a spy. Stellenbosch University itself did an excellent job of suppressing Nusas on campus, banning its activities and expelling then-chair Leslee Durr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I can't see how he could have had much impact. Nothing was discussed behind closed doors,&quot; said former activist Theo Erasmus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another activist from the time said she knew of at least one instance of someone in Behr's circle doing ANC underground work, and Behr knowing nothing about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police spies were hardly necessary on a campus where the university establishment kept a close eye on Nusas activities. Behr's former comrades cannot point to any particular act by the police which they could pin directly on his activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where Behr did have an impact on the organisation was encouraging its shift in a direction more acceptable to the Stellenbosch establishment. In 1988 Behr was elected to the SRC on a Nusas ticket, an unprecedented and controversial move. Before Behr's arrival, Nusas at Stellenbosch did not even try to engage with the political mainstream on campus, concentrating instead on its relations with the broader democratic movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Activists recall Behr tried to steer Nusas in a direction that would make it more acceptable on campus. These attempts were greeted with mixed reactions. Many in Nusas thought there was nothing to be gained from engaging with the right-wing administration and mainstream student organisations. Yet Behr was an eloquent speaker and a powerful advocate for the organisation, who stayed clear of the radical image Nusas had acquired on campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some see his attempt to change the image of Nusas as a deliberately divisive strategy -- others see it as the work of a flamboyant individual interested only in self-promotion, accusations which were echoed when Behr confessed from the conference platform last week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC's concerns have been fuelled by the realisation that, technically, the entire constitution would be open to review if referred back for amendments on the grounds that clauses did not comply with the 34 constitutional principles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC also knows that the political landscape has changed radically since the constitution was passed by the CA in May. Of particular interest to the ANC are the movements of its chief oppositions: the Inkatha Freedom Party and the National Party. The latter, which left the Government of National Unity as the constitution was adopted, has more muscle to flex to prove its points as chief of the opposition.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NP secretary general Roelf Meyer, however, is taking a supportive line.  &quot;I don't think that our position on the constitution would really change, although technically speaking the constitution could be re-opened. We would analyse the approach of the judge and concentrate on that. I don't think it would be responsible to open up the whole thing again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it is the Nat back-benchers, not Meyer, that the ANC is worrying about. Sources say the more conservative element of the NP, which has been pushing to define the NP in opposition, will see a second chance of negotiating the constitution as an opportunity for a public brawl on political principles, and possibly a stand-off. Their support for the passing of the constitution was lack-lustre in the first place, and the prospects of watching Meyer co-operate with the ANC a second time could raise the temperature within the party higher than ever before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Freedom Front's Corne Mulder thinks the NP would try to get extra mileage out of such a referral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They are desperate to demonstrate their strength as an opposition party ... but I really hope that it's not necessary because it is a chapter I want to close,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Certainly, the temptation for the NP to exploit a constitutional court referral to their political ends will be enormously tempting, given that the ANC will still need their support to get a two-thirds majority to pass the constitution a second time, within an allotted three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And while the ANC is watching Meyer's back with one eye, they have the other on Inkatha, which seems to have found a taste for national constitutional politics all over again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Loose talk in the Constitutional Court indicates that the party's hard-line constitutional advisor, Mario Ambrosini, believes it would be ideal for the IFP to make a dramatic return to the negotiating table, with a fresh deck of demands, should the constitution fail certification. The likelihood that the Kwazulu-Natal constitution will not be certified by the court means the IFP could want to shift their demands back from the provincial to the national negotiating table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IFP MP Walter Felgate has denied that any decision on a return has taken place, saying it would be discussed at the end of the month by the IFP' central council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, he ruled out any possibility of a negotiated alliance with the NP, if it did happen. &quot;The IFP makes its own decision. We will not run after (FW) De Klerk -- anything he does will not be anything more than posturing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC MP's say, off the record, that a return to the CA by the IFP was a possibility in the light of recent talks with Inkatha over co-operation in KwaZulu-Natal. While denying that the Constitution was on that agenda, they said that it was something that could flow from discussions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, ANC MP Pravin Gordhan says there is a &quot;gentleperson's&quot; agreement that negotiators would not tamper unnecessarily with the constitution should it be referred and that only those aspects not complying with the process will be looked at.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Where an issue is in isolation, it will be easy to negotiate, but where an issue has a ripple effect on other agreements, the renegotiation will be more difficult,&quot; he acknowledged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Part of the problem is that nobody is quite sure exactly how the Constitutional Court would refer back the constitution, and what its instructions would be. The process would have to be managed politically to prevent the delicately stitched constitution from falling apart at the seams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What makes the ANC even more anxious is that it is unlikely that the Constitutional chair Cyril Ramaphosa would be available to steer the process through to its final version, because of business commitments. There is nobody in the ANC with the experience or authority to replace him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many of the constitutional administrative staff have organised new jobs and will not be available to see the process through to its conclusion, should it be extended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The DP's veteran negotiator Colin Eglin agrees with Gordhan and Meyer that it would be unlikely that senior politicians would want to unravel all the knots tied during the late hours and long months of negotiations.  However, he does not think the constitution will be passed first time round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We produced a constitution of 241 clauses, and we did not have a bunch of high-powered lawyers testing the clauses as we went along to see whether they would conform with the 34 principles. If, as a result of our effort, every single one of those clauses complied with the principles we would be super-people. I'd be very surprised if we hit our jackpot,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Police have finally accepted the argument that there may have been a conspiracy to attack the African National Congress's headquarters in Johannesburg, which led to the shooting of eight Zulu marchers by ANC security personnel at the headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Andrew Leask, head of the police unit carrying out special investigations for Gauteng, said his office was now prepared to look into the claims and report its findings to the Witwatersrand attorney general, who has to make a decision on possible prosecutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He argued that documents filed with the Pretoria Supreme Court this week are the first &quot;factual evidence&quot; put before the police of a plot to destabilise the country by killing senior ANC members on March 28 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have had allegations slung from both sides during our two-year inquiry, but no one has brought us any proof before now,&quot; Leask explained .</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is the first solid thing we have had on the table and we will investigate it vigorously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the Mail &amp; Guardian has information that Transvaal Attorney General Jan D'Oliveira's office has been in possession of statements about these allegations for the past two years. The information was first obtained during the debriefing of former Vlakplaas operative Andries &quot;Brood&quot; van Heerden by investigators of the Goldstone Commission in Denmark in early 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The information was passed on to D'Oliveira's special team investigating &quot;third force&quot; activities, established to continue investigations not completed by Judge Richard Goldstone's commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Included in the information given by Van Heerden to investigators was that the march would be routed past the ANC's headquarters at Shell House in central Johannesburg. In the expected commotion, it was planned that an armed group would enter the building pretending to seek sanctuary, then try to kill as many people as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC is being sued for R10-million by 101 people, some of whom were injured on the day, and others who are dependents of those killed. A total of 54 people died during numerous incidents of violence which erupted during the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inkatha Freedom Party MP Themba Khosa (already implicated in gun running to the IFP during the trial of former Vlakplaas commander Eugene de Kock) along with several of his party's Gauteng leaders -- including Humphrey Ndlovu, Victor Ndlovu and James Ndlovu -- have been named as co-conspirators.  Their police partners are said to include Van Heerden, Willie Nortjie, Charlie Chait and De Kock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Vlakplaas had been disbanded in 1993 De Kock was still its de facto commander. He apparently continued to work informally for the SAP, was a regular visitor to Pretoria police headquarters and could even be contacted on his police pager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to papers before the court, the group held secret meetings at which it was decided to use the IFP's anti-election march as a cover for storming Shell House. The aim was to kill senior ANC leaders including Thabo Mbeki, Walter Sisulu and Winnie Madizikela-Mandela, who were holding meetings in the building at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC deputy secretary general Cheryl Carolus described the Shell House tragedy as a &quot;desperate last stand&quot; by people who were prepared to use innocent Zulus and IFP members as &quot;cannon-fodder&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said the ANC knew beforehand about the alleged plot and that was the reason Nelson Mandela, then party president, ordered security guards to defend the building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We got information from hostel members and from our own intelligence people within the IFP. That was why Madiba asked President de Klerk for extra police protection -- which we were promised but never got.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the day of the march, Carolus said people in the building became particularly worried when reports reached them that 30 people had been killed in Soweto as the marchers made their way to Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite several frantic calls to senior police officers by ANC members including Winnie Madizikela-Mandela, no police reinforcements arrived. The handful of officers on duty fled in the face of the marchers armed with an assortment of &quot;traditional weapons&quot; and chanting, &quot;Today someone will die, you dogs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I was at Shell House and can tell you that I was very scared,&quot; said Carolus. &quot;Although we very much regret the loss of life, those of us within the building on the day were in no doubt what would have happened had the guards not fired when they did,&quot; she insisted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC has, however, failed to convince many people and much of the media that its guards acted in self-defence and the shooting was not just a &quot;massacre&quot; of innocents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have definitely not been winning the propaganda war,&quot; said one ANC spokesman, who described the incident as a dark shadow which has loomed over the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He recalled that the shooting came about during a backdrop of paranoia and fear as the general election approached and the country seemed poised on the brink of widespread violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You must remember that only two weeks earlier the Goldstone Commission had announced the existence of &quot;third force&quot; activities headed by senior police officers, including the then deputy commissioner Lieutenant General Basie Smith,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Goldstone later looked into shooting and other public violence which took place on the day of the march. Although his inquiry made no findings, it rejected a submission from the IFP and the KwaZulu government that the gathering had been on behalf of the Zulu people and was apolitical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There can be no doubt that the purpose of the gathering was party political and for the purpose of launching its anti-election campaign,&quot; the commission said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A spokesman for the Witwatersrand attorney general said this week everyone connected with the criminal case surrounding the march was away.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - It is only 12 years since the apartheid regime began tentatively conferring with the imprisoned Nelson Mandela. It is only 10, to show how much times have changed, since the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group flew out of South Africa in protest after PW Botha ordered military raids on African National Congress bases outside the country. It is only seven since the ANC's Harare Declaration opened up the possibility of serious negotiations, and only six since Mandela was released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now he is the guest of the Queen and the toast of Brixton. But his visit has another significance, marking the transition, internationally, from a time of celebration to a time of hard bargaining and hard choices for South Africa. The completion of the Constitution and the withdrawal of the National Party from the government earlier this year ended a period during which the basis for a new state was worked out between former opponents without notable violence, except in KwaZulu-Natal, and without crippling disagreements.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But these achievements are already yesterday's work, and Mandela himself is already, in some sense, history. The generation of which he is a part has already gone. His longevity, his will, and his qualities mean he will for some time longer play an important role, but inevitably the work to come will be done by men and women who are young enough to be his children and grandchildren. Difficult though the political settlement has been, the problems that now have to be tackled will be more difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa has to engage again with the formidable inter-related issues of internal stability on the one hand and of its place in the world economy on the other. Again, because these are old problems in South Africa, whose economic life has always been managed politically and yet whose political life has always been buffeted by economic changes, sanctions being only the most extreme case of such pressures. That is why Mandela is accompanied on this trip by 100 businessmen and economic negotiators. South Africa has to bid for investment and trade in a world where capital can pick and choose much more widely than in the past, and it has to bid for it in a way that does not lead to political and social catastrophe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are two views about the South African economy. One is that it is a wealthy country whose wealth just needs to be divided more fairly. The other is that it is a potentially poor country, a country on the edge, a place where political mismanagement could lead on to economic disaster. The latter is closer to the truth than the former. The new government inherited a protected economy with some distant similarities to Russia. The old regime had always seen self-reliance as a virtue, even more so as sanctions came in.  Now, as the tariff barriers come down, many firms are threatened, and with them the jobs needed to meet the aspirations of the black urban population.  Investment from abroad is needed to upgrade South Africa's capacity to supply its own market and stop job loss, even though the government's plans, of course, assume that major increases in jobs are going to be possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Battle has already been joined between the unions, which want to preserve and extend to new workers the relatively reasonable wages some workers receive, and the business community, which argues that investment will not materialise unless there is a two-tier labour market, with one tier largely unregulated. It has also been joined on privatisation, with the government edging closer to an option which would bring it considerable income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But privatisation, if it follows the pattern elsewhere, would strip out jobs and reduce the wages of those who remain. Both the two-tier and the privatisation options run against the political grain. The ANC did not make a revolution in order to turn South Africa into a low-wage labour camp. It is dedicated to narrowing the gap between white relative wealth and black poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the land, similar choices have to be made. More than four-fifths of agricultural land is owned by 55 000 commercial white farmers, with 1,2-million micro-farmers on the rest. There is a landless rural population, which wants land -- but if it gets land at the expense of the commercial farms, food production and some rural jobs, could be undermined. Similarly, tourism, a big source of jobs, depends to some extent on features to do with the politics of the old regime, basically the hiding away of population and poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It must sometimes seem as if everything that is economically dictated, or demanded by business or outside investors, is politically dangerous or involves a betrayal of the people. Or that everything that is politically desirable constitutes a step on the road to economic ruin. The broadest choice of all is between a &quot;southern&quot; approach to the economy, emphasising small businesses, small capital requirements, and limited regulation, and a &quot;northern&quot; approach which tries to incorporate black workers into a high-income European and American model, a model which also gives advantages to the big, highly organised firm. South Africa already has both models in different sectors. The difficult answer may be that the &quot;southern&quot; emphasis is the right one, while a &quot;northern&quot; economic sector is nevertheless preserved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The skilled compromises that policy will involve over the years will demand a high quality of leadership, both in the technical sense of good judgment and in the capacity to inspire people and get them to endure hardships and disappointments. Undoubtedly South Africa has a much larger, better-educated leadership in the ANC than any other African liberation movement or party had or has. The consequence is a diverse and well-educated political class; but it has weaknesses. Ministers of great quality contrast with far lesser men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But more important than the question of individual talents is whether the overall organisation of government maximises or minimises ability and engages loyalty. Policy now sometimes seems to wait on decisions from above, and those ANC members who recall the extended debates of the past, from which they emerged, as one put it, feeling that the decision was &quot;common property&quot;, wonder at the direction of events. South Africa has a resilience which all races display. It will undoubtedly need it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The gumboot slappers were getting kind of frisky as they emerged from a heaving sea of leopard and lion skin, root-dyed cotton and bangle jewellery. They were dressed in white shirts, blue trousers and wellie boots carefully daubed in the rainbow colours of South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A shimmy here, a shouggle there, then up came the boots and -- slap.  Around them the harmony: Nel-son Mandela. Then higher, Nelson Mandela. Down again, Ne-elson Mandela, before it rolled away, Nelson Mandela. Shouggle, shimmy, shouggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I can't call him God,&quot; said George Mughovani, the Pavarotti of South Africa according to his press agent. &quot;But he is everything to us, he is our saviour.&quot; As if to prove his claim Mandela walked into St James's Park just as the early morning sun broke through the clouds and showered him in pure white light.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A tree stood in the middle of the park, a London plane tree, its roots still exposed besides a large pile of earth. &quot;It's special in a world of pollution,&quot; said Neville Labovitch, chairman of the Prince of Wales' Royal Parks Tree Appeal. &quot;It thrives, it's strong, and it's dependable. It will live for a very long time. It is a Mandela tree.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A crowd, close to a thousand strong, cheered as they craned to see Mandela secure it. &quot;This is very symbolic,&quot; said Mandela. &quot;I wish I had the resources to come here and water it every week.&quot; He picked up a spade and attacked the pile of earth, scooping up dirt and dropping it in the hole.  After the fifth spadeful it became apparent that he took the task seriously, no little bit of dust and then let the gardeners get on with it. When Mandela plants a tree it stays there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And so it is with the man. Having arrived in Britain late on Monday, he has taken London with a great grin and pure, undiluted honesty. In a cynical city the South African is king, exploding the bigotry and twisted politics of Britain's establishment with sheer force of character. The unpleasantness will return of course, flooding in when Mandela's plane lifts off from Heathrow. But for the moment, the boss class really seem to like him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Once the tree had been secured, Labovitch tried to speak but was interrupted by the singing and dancing from a small pavilion. The performers came from nine different regions of South Africa but were playing together in a unity that mimicked what Mandela stands for. Finally the president had to dance, the 78-year-old facing off a man in full tribal costume, ostrich feathers and all. The dancer stomped and the president gently swayed in perfect time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A few hundred yards away, 20 hours before, a 6 000 strong crowd had packed the Horse Guards parade for the first glimpse of the prisoner turned president. Snipers, binoculars hard pressed on their faces, scanned the crowds below while horses skittered on the gravel floor to the the chant of the crowd. &quot;Nelson, Nelson, Nelson.&quot; In days gone by a crowd calling for Mandela might have expected the horses to charge, their riders swinging batons. But on Tuesday the cavalry had come to honour, not to bury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still, as the the Rolls-Royce passed the statue of King George and turned on to the parade ground, Mandela might have looked up at the shooters in the sky and thought of Tory MP Teddy Taylor's comment of the 1980s: &quot;Nelson Mandela should be shot.&quot; But maybe not, it is unlikely that Mandela has ever heard of Taylor -- more interesting men have said and done much worse to him over the years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From the back door of Downing Street John Major strode across the ground to meet the visitor, joining the bright yellow Queen and suited defence minister Malcolm Rifkind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A cheer went up to meet Major who turned and waved. It was strange to hear the prime minster feted until the force of the roar that greeted Mandela drove all in front of it. The distinct differences in volume saying all that needed said of the difference in stature between the two men. As Major stood amid the pomp and circumstance, jealousy must have gnawed at him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela and Prince Philip walked slowly through the bear-skinned troops of the Irish Guards, their combined age disappearing back towards the charge of the Light Brigade, their shared experience a mere suckling babe. Mandela didn't look at the well turned-out troops, just wandered through the line as if it was his duty. It wasn't, one assumes, his sort of gig.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The crowd was beside itself with joy. &quot;The kids are so excited, so very, very excited,&quot; said Carol Chin, a teacher at Stockwell Park school. &quot;He's a living legend.&quot; She unravelled a banner her horde of tots had painted. &quot;They wrote letters, we're going to try and give them to him.&quot; So it was Mandela and not the Queen they had come to see? &quot;You can take that for right,&quot; she grinned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The name &quot;Nelson&quot; was handed to Mandela by his first teacher, Miss Mdingane, at missionary school in Qunu. &quot;Why she bestowed this particular name upon me I have no guess,&quot; he wrote in his autobiography. &quot;Perhaps it had something to do with the great British sea captain Lord Nelson.&quot; It has been a long trip from the South African countryside to the great offices that surround the towering column where Horatio now stands, a journey made by fighting the people that laud Nelson, often in the form of the English government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Margaret Thatcher summed up her government's policy on South Africa and its refusal to impose sanctions on the racist government in 1987. &quot;The ANC is a typical terrorist organisation,&quot; she said. &quot;Anyone who thinks it is going to run the government is living in cloud-cuckoo land.&quot; As yet the only sign of bitterness that has ever been shown by Mandela is his refusal to meet Thatcher, a move that provoked &quot;black terrorist&quot; shouts from the Tory backbenchers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is impossible to do anything but stand open-mouthed at a man who is prepared to forgive those who locked him up for 27 years, and by proxy the foreign governments that did not stand in their way. To see him alongside Philip, the man who told students in China that they would develop &quot;slitty eyes&quot; if they stayed too long, makes him tower leagues above the physically bigger man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet on Wednesday Mandela had nothing but praise for the Queen's hospitality. &quot;The hospitality of the royal family, the government and the people of Britain is beyond words,&quot; he said. &quot;I expected a very warm reception -- but nothing to the standard I've received.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The serious part of Mandela's trip was played out in the hours when the president was not being feted by the royals. He addressed a large conference of businessmen on Wednesday morning in an attempt to bring more investment to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The central message that I bring to you this morning is that we should build on what exists,&quot; he told the conference. &quot;It is a message infused with urgency precisely because, beyond the profound political changes, the iniquitous system that we set out together to destroy is still alive and well. The poverty, decay in the social fabric, and profound inequality that are the product of the past can only be eradicated with your cooperation.&quot; At lunchtime, in a joint press conference with John Major, the British government pledged a further Pounds 60-million of aid in support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unlike the leaders who come cap in hand to the cynical governments of Europe, Mandela is asking for an investment in his dream and it appeals.  &quot;There is a real will and desire in the city to see South Africa succeed,&quot; said Sir Robin Renwick, ambassador to South Africa in the dying days of apartheid and now a senior member of investment bankers Robert Fleming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cool, calm of Westminster Abbey was broken by the cheer exploding from its gates as Mandela turned up to honour the Unknown Soldier. Wearing a stylish gold shirt, he moved into the sanctury to meet the Dean, Reverend Michael Mayne. It is standard practice for visiting heads of state to lay a wreath, the visitors' book boasts names from Clinton to Chirac, but Mayne was beaming. &quot;Of all the ceremonies I have attended this one gives me the most pleasure,&quot; he said. &quot;His calibre is self-evident.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After he had been given a tour and a book to show him the parts he had missed Mandela spent nearly 10 minutes chatting to the people outside. &quot;I'll see you on Thursday and Friday,&quot; Glen Bushell, a 21-year-old student from Ashford in Kent shouted as the president finally stepped into the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Later that night, at the grand state banquet which the Queen, who has had enormous affection for Mandela since her state visit to South Africa 18 months ago, toasted her guest. &quot;You have provided the leadership and, by your willingness to embrace your former captors, have set the course towards national reconciliation and freedom for all the people of South Africa,&quot; she said in her small, high voice. Then they clinked glasses. Earlier, she had given him a 1768 edition, eight-volume set of Shakespeare, an extraordinary present among the many he has been receiving (Prince Charles gave him a lithograph of one of his own watercolours).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sun is shining, people are dancing and singing, and Mandela is smiling. As the tour of London continued on Thursday Mandela addressed both Houses of Parliament in Westminster Hall, an enormous venue that was last used by Charles de Gaulle in 1960. On Friday he is visiting Brixton to thank the people for their support during the long, gruelling years of apartheid.  Everywhere he travels, the bow-wave of happiness spreads out in his wake, engulfing those caught up in the turbulence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From under the monuments of those who fought to keep Britain free, Mandela moves, exposing the shallow evil committed in the name of so-called astute foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Out of jail and over here, Mandela is a symbol of freedom -- and he exists in our time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Deputy President Thabo Mbeki played a key role in promoting the &quot;miracle deals&quot; between the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party which have a real chance of ending low-level civil war in KwaZulu-Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IFP Secretary General Ziba Jiyane this week told the Mail &amp; Guardian that reports last weekend of an imminent coalition or merger between the rival parties were premature. But he confirmed that a range of peace initiatives at provincial level had created a spirit of rapprochement which could lead to &quot;various stages of future co-operation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other IFP sources say that, while the peace deals were driven by the provincial leadership of both parties, Mbeki's pragmatic style &quot;helped lower the political temperature&quot; in Cape Town. This ensured that old enmities between President Nelson Mandela and Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi were not able to disrupt the delicate negotiations taking place in Durban.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC provincial leader Jacob Zuma, who played a major role in bringing both parties to the table, approached Mbeki earlier this year to complain that bellicose statements from Mandela about the Inkatha leaders were interrupting progress and low-key parleys being held in the province between proponents of peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because the president had adopted a lower leadership profile in recent months, Mbeki was able to step in with a low-key diplomatic approach that was more in tune with developments on the ground in the province. The deputy president had a series of face-to-face talks with Inkatha's Correctional Services Minister Sipho Mzimela, and this helped to ensure that Inkatha's national leadership in Cape Town supported the peace talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The M&amp;G has established that the big breakthrough for people in the embattled province came at a series of secret parleys held over several months between the provincial leaders of the ANC and the IFP, first at the home of Inkatha-supporting businessman Arnold Zulman and then at the government's Bourquin House in Durban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The thaw in relations began with each party exploring the reasons for the schism in the 1970s that led, in later years, to violent confrontations between their members. This, says KwaZulu-Natal Premier Frank Mdlalose, involved &quot;going back into the past and finding out where we went wrong. We presented our version. They presented their version and, yes, we have come to some sort of agreement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the end of May, the delegations from both parties went to Cape Town to discuss plans for a provincial peace summit in June. Mandela was away at the time and Mbeki hosted talks with provincial leaders from both parties, giving further impetus to the new diplomacy and stress on common experiences and philosophies of the two groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It appears the emerging consensus revolves around an Africanist strand of political thinking that is shared by most of the politicians who brokered the deals that have given KwaZulu-Natal its first prospect of real peace in years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zuma and Mbeki on the ANC's side are said to share Africanist sympathies, while Jiyane, Mdlalose and former KwaZulu MEC Celani Mthetwa, also a key player, have similar convictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A crucial development was that both Ziba Jiyane and the ANC leaders in the province are sympathetic to the idea of converting their movements into political parties in an Africanist way, rather than in the style of Western parties,&quot; said one source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The upshot is that hard-line white rightwingers who took over senior leadership posts within the IFP after the 1994 elections are now being marginalised by a centrist African bloc emerging within the Zulu nationalist party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is reflected in the way IFP central committee member Walter Felgate and party adviser Mario Ambrosini, now squabbling with each other over the party's recent setbacks in the Constitutional Court, have taken a backseat role in recent developments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources in Inkatha say there is strong grassroots dissatisfaction with white rightwingers who got comfortable jobs after the 1994 elections, and that pressure to remove them will increase as Inkatha's branch and provincial party structures are strengthened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hard-line warlords in Inkatha, who rely on strong-arm tactics to rule over shantytown and rural communities in the province, rather than modern civic systems set up after last month's local government elections, are also likely to be shifted sideways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An early indication of this is the way Inkatha last week suspended the controversial mayor of Lindelani, Thomas Tshabalala, reportedly for leading the recent march through Durban that led to a violent shoot-out with police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This week's announcement of a power-sharing deal between the IFP, ANC and minority parties in the Durban Metropolitan Council is another portent of of an emerging Africanist consensus in KwaZulu-Natal's politics.  Significantly, the NP has been left out of a pioneering agreement in the province's strongest local government forum that will act as a powerful stimulant for co-operation at other levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dennis Nkosi, executive director of the Peace Committee that helped facilitate the peace deals, says there are three issues that have to be dealt with for the process to consolidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First, the cut-off date for amnesty needs to be renegotiated (and there are recent signs of flexibility on this from the ANC) so that IFP and ANC officials involved in political violence after the 1994 elections can be lured into the peace process with promises of immunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then the IFP needs to reconsider its refusal to participate in the truth commission. By making use of the institution it could present its version of what happened during the 1980s, thus allowing the breakthrough which took place behind closed doors between the parties' leadership to be extended into a broader form of reconciliation between rank-and-file supporters of the rival organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And ANC leaders at national and provincial levels need to &quot;revisit&quot; the question of Zulu culture and the role that traditional leaders play in local and provincial government. Hostility to the chiefs and their cultural authority on the part of some ANC activists has been the root cause of some of the most most violent community conflict.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York - The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) today urged the Algerian government to release an imprisoned political cartoonist and lift the suspension of his newspaper. And CPJ reiterated its call on the government to rescind its imposition of prior censorship on all independent reporting on security matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chawki Amari, a cartoonist with the independent, French-language daily La Tribune, was arrested at his home in Algiers on the morning of July 4. He is charged with desecrating a national emblem for drawing a cartoon, published on July 1, which depicted the Algerian flag in a satiric manner. If convicted of this offense, Amari could be sentenced to up to ten years in prison. On July 10, an examining magistrate denied Amari's request for bail.  He is being held at Serkadji prison</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On July 3, La Tribune's offices were sealed and Kheireddine Ameyar, its publisher, and Baya Gacemi, the editor in chief, were placed under judicial supervision and ordered to appear before the court twice a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Algerian editors and journalists have called a newspaper strike for Monday, July 15, to demand Amari's release and the reopening of La Tribune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We support our Algerian colleagues' demands,&quot; said William A. Orme, Jr., CPJ's executive director. &quot;The Algerian government's censorship policies and the continuing terrorist campaign against journalists put the press in an untenable position. Journalists who face a constant threat of assassination by terrorists are put even more at risk by being forced to print government propaganda as news.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since May 1993, 59 journalists have been murdered in Algeria. This is the most lethal assassination campaign against the press documented by CPJ in the last ten years. The shadowy Armed Islamic Group (GIA) has claimed responsibility for the bulk of journalists' slayings in Algeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the army interrupted the electoral process in January 1992 to prevent a victory by the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in parliamentary election, dozens of independent journalists have been dragged to court, newspapers have been suspended, and the state's monopoly on printing has been used to intimidate publishers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CPJ is a nonpartisan organization of journalists dedicated to the defense of press freedom and journalists' rights throughout the world.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> United Nations - The Security Council July 11 extended the mandate of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) until 11 October.  It urged the Government of Angola and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to move ahead with formation of a government of unity and national reconciliation and with the seating of all elected members of Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Through its unanimous adoption of resolution 1064 (1996), the Council urged both parties to take all necessary steps to complete the formation of the national armed forces, the planned movement of UNITA troops out of quartering areas, and the orderly transition of demobilized troops to civilian life. It also urged them to move constitutional issues forward in a spirit of national reconciliation, and to incorporate UNITA personnel into the State administration, Angolan Armed Forces and natio</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While acknowledging recent progress in the peace process, the Council expressed regret that implementation was still behind schedule. It encouraged Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi to meet at the earliest opportunity, within Angola, to resolve their remaining differences.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Council welcomed the progress made by the registration of over 52,000 UNITA troops in quartering areas and called on UNITA to complete the process. It also urged UNITA to hand over to UNAVEM III all arms, particularly heavy weapons, ammunition and military equipment, without which the quartering process would not be complete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Angolan Government was commended for the promulgation of its Amnesty Law, for the quartering of its rapid reaction police, and for the continuing withdrawal of its Armed Forces to barracks. It was urged to take the required corrective measures regarding those withdrawals, as agreed with UNAVEM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Council reminded the parties to cease the dissemination of all hostile propaganda. The Government was urged to provide facilities for establishment of independent United Nations radio, while UNITA was urged to complete the transformation of its radio station Vorgan into a non-partisan station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By other terms of the text, the Council demanded that all concerned take steps to ensure the safety of United Nations and other international personnel and premises, and to guarantee the safety and free movement of humanitarian supplies. It also condemned the use of mercenaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Member States were strongly urged to provide promptly the financial resources needed for the demobilization and social reintegration of ex- combatants. The international community was urged to speedily fulfil its pledges to aid in the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Angola's economy and the resettlement of displaced persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Council also asked the Secretary-General to report by 1 October on progress made by the parties in meeting their agreed timetable, and to report by the third week of August on whether they had completed formation of the government of unity and national reconciliation. It reminded the parties that UNAVEM III is expected to complete its mission by February 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Statements were made by the representatives of Angola, Portugal, Algeria, Malawi, Brazil, South Africa, United Republic of Tanzania, Tunisia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Cape Verde, Germany, Egypt, Botswana, Chile, Republic of Korea, China, Italy, Guinea-Bissau, Russian Federation, United Kingdom, Honduras, Indonesia, Poland, United States and France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the outset of the meeting, Council President Alain Dejammet (France) expressed the Council's deep sympathy to the Government and people of China for the loss of life and property suffered during the recent floods in that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following is the text of Resolution 1064:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Security Council,</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 12.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The text of the secretary general's report to the Security Council:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Security Council meets this afternoon to consider the situation in Angola. It has before it a 27 June report of the Secretary-General (document S/1996/503), in which he recommends the mandate of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) for a further three months, until 11 October. Stating that the coming weeks will be critical, he says the Angolan parties, especially the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), must implement their commitments in good time if the peace process is to succeed. The General Assembly has appropriated funds for maintenance of the Mission at a monthly rate of $28,186,410 gross ($27,664,010 net), should the Council decide to extend its mandate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The parties have not fulfilled the time-frame agreed upon between Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi at their Libreville meeting on 1 March, the report states. If the peace process is to retain credibility, urgent corrective action is required in a number of areas. These include the continuing delays in the quartering of UNITA troops, the high number of desertions from quartering areas, the unsatisfactory quality and quantity of weapons and ammunition handed over, the failure to quarter UNITA police personnel, and the incomplete withdrawal of the Angolan Armed Forces form forward positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under a timetable agreed by the Angolan Government and UNITA, the quartering of all UNITA troops was to have been completed by the end of June, the report states. As at 25 June, 51,597 of a declared total of 62,500 UNITA troops had been registered in United Nations-run quartering areas and only 26,150 personal weapons and 3,368 crew-served weapons had been handed over.  More than 18,000 troops have arrived in the camps without any weapon and only a very small quantity of ammunition has been brought in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UNITA has also not handed over any of its heavy weapons, rocket launchers, anti-aircraft artillery, armoured personnel carriers and tanks, communications and engineering equipment, or vehicles used for military purposes, the report states. Desertion from quartering areas continue, with more than 5,628 persons having left as at 25 June. Although the Angolan Armed Forces conducted the second phase of its troop withdrawals from forward positions, 14 of the 47 redeployments were determined by UNAVEM to have been unsatisfactory. The Angolan Armed Forces is being urged to take corrective steps immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The picture is no more reassuring on the political front, the Secretary-General states. The parties have yet to take a number of steps towards the formation of the government of unity and national reconciliation.  in particular, it was essential that the question of the post of Vice- President to be occupied by UNITA be expeditiously resolved. &quot;If the peace process is to succeed, the parties, especially UNITA, must show greater readiness to implement, in good time, the commitments they have entered into.  Unless they do so, the international community is unlikely to make similar efforts that are required of it also.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although there has still been no progress towards the establishment of an independent United Nations radio, the Government has given additional time on the national radio and television to UNAVEM III, the report states. On the positive side, the framework agreement on military matters was adopted, an amnesty law was promulgated on 8 May, the incorporation of UNITA military personnel into the Angolan Armed Forces has begun, the quartering of the Government's rapid reaction police has been completed, and the Angolan Armed Forces have conducted the second phase of the withdrawal of their troops from forward positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Secretary-General says the military environment in the country has remained calm and that only minor troop movement and skirmishes were reported during the period since 30 April. However, the marked increase in violent crime is causing serious concern. The law and order situation has become particularly precarious in the areas from which UNITA troops have been withdrawn. Measures must be taken to improve security in those areas, including extension of State administration there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The general humanitarian situation is improving gradually, the report states. Despite lingering mistrust, joint teams of government and UNITA officials, with the participation of United Nations and non-governmental organizations, are expanding humanitarian activities throughout the country.  However, restrictions on the free circulation of people and goods in some areas continue to be a matter of concern. With respect to the observance of human rights, both the Government and UNITA have promised to cooperate fully with UNAVEM's investigations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Secretary-General says careful consideration must be given to future plans for those UNITA troops who will not be selected for service in the Angolan Armed Forces or the national police. The creation of reconstruction teams could become an important means of promoting social reintegration and overall economic rehabilitation. Noting that only $10 million of the $42 million required for the first year of demobilization and social reintegration has been received to date, the Secretary-General urges the donor community to fulfil the pledges made at the Round Table Conference in Brussels in September 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UNAVEM III has become the largest peace-keeping operation of the United Nations, the report states. As the February 1997 target for completion of the operation approaches, the Secretary-General has initiated contingency planning for the phased downsizing of its military component. That would be carried out as soon as the quartering process has been successfully concluded and the process of incorporating UNITA troops into the Angolan Armed Forces and forming the unified armed forces has reached an advanced stage. Specific recommendations on the matter will be submitted by the Secretary-General in a forthcoming report to the Council.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington DC - In a statement issued July 14 by EarthAction, an international network of citizen organizations has endorsed a world-wide embargo on Nigerian oil. The text of the statement, endorsed by 70 groups listed at the end of the document., reads as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than seventy campaigning groups around the world joined today in calling for an international oil embargo on Nigeria until democracy is restored there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The groups are supporting appeals from leading Nigerian democrats, including Nobel prize-winning author Wole Soyinka, who argue that only an oil embargo will apply serious pressure on Nigeria's military regime to encourage it to relinquish power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Sani Abacha, Nigeria's military dictator, seized power in a military coup in 1993, and has suppressed dissent by force.  President-elect Moshood Abiola, winner of a 1993 general election, has been jailed for &quot;treason&quot;.  Among other pro-democracy leaders jailed by Abacha is former President Olusegun Obassanjo, who restored democracy in Nigeria after an earlier period of military rule.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a joint statement, the groups warn that &quot;not only have the people of Nigeria been deprived of their basic human rights, but there is a danger of massive bloodshed unless the world heeds the calls of Nigeria's brave democrats for an international embargo on the purchase of Nigerian oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their statement continues: &quot;Ninety-six percent of Nigeria's foreign revenue comes from oil.  Much of that money goes directly into the pockets of the generals.  An oil embargo is the one step that would hit the dictatorship hard, and help to bring about the immediate restoration of democracy in Africa's largest nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the widely condemned execution of writer and environmentalist Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other campaigners in 1995, there have been growing calls for an oil embargo on Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Nelson Mandela of South Africa has called for an embargo.  A number of governments in the European Union have supported the proposal, but moves toward a European embargo have been blocked by the governments of Britain and the Netherlands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Clinton Administration has not ruled out an oil embargo, and there have been efforts to impose an embargo through the US Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Until now, governments have confined themselves to more limited steps, such as the three-year suspension of Nigeria from the Commonwealth, and restrictions on the supply of arms to the Nigerian military.  General Abacha has promised an eventual return to democracy, and many governments claim to be waiting to see whether his promise is serious.  Nigeria's democrats, however, are profoundly sceptical that, without strong international pressure, this latest promise of democracy from the military will fare any better than other broken promises in the past.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - For political correspondents who besieged the hotel suite of Samuel Ikoku, on June 28, they had gone to hear him speak on the recent meeting of the Nigerian delegation with the Commonwealth Minister's Action Group. As a member of that delegation sent to argue Nigeria's case for re-admission into the commonwealth, the reporters hoped to get an insider information on what transpired at the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the reporters came away with an even bigger story. As vice-chairman of the Transition Implementation Committee, TIC, to monitor the administration's transition programme, Ikoku was asked of the possible implications of the failure of the government to keep to the schedule of creating more states and local government councils in the second quarter of this year. Without pausing to think the matter through, Ikoku shot back that in the event, the TIC would ask for an alteration to the programme. He said the late submission of the report of the Mbanefo committee on states creation and boundary adjustment by one month has put the government in an awkward position, and that with the carry-over of plans for second quarter into the third, the schedule has to change. The only alternative, Ikoku said, was for the government to abandon states creation, an option he said the administration would not consider. &quot;In fact, it is one of the things that has delayed the final draft of the constitution,&quot; Ikoku revealed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to all this, Ikoku said the TIC was considering the short tenure given to councilors elected on non-party basis in March this year.  According to the transition time-table, another council polls, to be contested on party platforms has been slated for the fourth quarter of the year beginning in October. This gives only a seven-month tenure to the councilors. Still, Ikoku sought to allay the fears of Nigerians that an alteration of the programme will result in an extension of the handover date: &quot;I am not saying we are not going to make changes here and there in the body of the transition programme because when you come to implementation, you may be forced by circumstances to make one or two changes. But October 1, 1998 is inevitable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From all appearances, Ikoku was only a forerunner. The following day, Mamman Nasir, the TIC chairman himself, told reporters that the head of state was angry at the delay in the submission of the report of the States Creation Committee as it might unhinge the transition time-table. With that kite from the two principal policemen of the implementation of the transition programme, Nigerians were once more rudely reminded of the Babandiga era when the handover date kept moving further away with every gust of that administration's whims. By Sunday when Ikoku's statement made the front page headlines of all the major newspapers, it blacked out the monstrous guidelines for the registration of political parties as the focus of general discussion, if not apprehension. Those who read a sinister omen into Ikoku's kite have a point; his antecedents are far from comforting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An old political war horse, Ikoku started his political career well before the first republic as a Marxist, spawned by the Kwame Nkrumah ideological School, Winneba, Ghana. A member of the left of centre Action Group in the First Republic, he became the leader of parliamentary opposition in The Eastern Region and the party's secretary-general. Ikoku's atonishing metamorphosis occurred in the Second Republic when he swung from the leftist Peoples Redemption Party to the extreme right with the conservative National Party of Nigeria. After the collapse of the Second Republic, he wrote a book titled Fourth Coup D'etat: Options for Modern Statehood. In it, he advocated for a permanent place for the military in the governance of Nigerian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He attempted to put his theory into practice, when he and other old politicians formed the Committee of Elder Statement and Concerned Citizens, a group whose only visible agenda was a campaign for former president Ibrahim Babangida not to handover power to civilians after an eight-year transition programme. Against the run of domestic and international opinion, the group, consisting of Tola Adeniyi, then chairman of Daily Times, Kalu Anya, a retired Chief Judge of Borno State, Margaret Ekpo and Jane Mokalu, both legislators in the old Eastern region, Austin Ezenwa, a former deputy governor in the Second Republic, Cyrus Nunnieh, a Second Republic senator, as well as others stated that &quot;the on-going political process of that time would not promote a climate conducive to national unity, political stability and the welfare of the Nigerian people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the exit of Babangida from office, Ikoku found new outlet for his obstructionist antics to a quick return to democracy. As a government nominee to the constitutional conference under the government of Sani Abacha, he emerged as the touchstone for the defence of the military establishment. When the delegates voted overwhelmingly for the government to handover in 1996, Ikoku issued a statement to flail the delegates. Titled &quot;Our March to Political Reconstruction,&quot; the statement condemned the 1996 handover date as unrealistic. In an argument more remarkable for its sophistry rather than its logic, Ikoku said that &quot;The national constitutional conference has tended to bury its head in sand over the issues of putting an end to military intervention in the political arena while there is the tendency to confuse a terminal date with the termination of military intervention in politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given his background, it was clear that Ikoku was being used as a catspaw for a pre-determined position by the administration. It was not surprising that contrary to its stated procedure, the conference revisited the issue of an exit date and ended up giving a blank cheque to the administration to relinquish power in its own time. This time around, Ikoku's blinding smoke on states creation may burst into an incandescent flame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like the many hurdles to Babangida's transition train, the report on states creation seemed to have been primed for a delay. That tardiness was planted way back in the last quarter of last year when the implementation of the transition time-table commenced. At the time, it was the government itself that failed to act on all the items listed for the very first quarter which included the inauguration of the states creation committee and other agencies of the transition programme. In fact, it was public outcry that the programme was already getting derailed that prompted the government to action. By then, the first quarter had lapsed leading to a spill over of first quarter agenda into the second.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Joshua Ogbonnanya, a member of the constitutional conference pointed out, the State Creation Committee was not given enough time to carry out its assignments. It had five months to receive memoranda, study them, make verification of the claims by agitators and write a comprehensive report on its findings and recommendations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus by May 31 when the committee was expected to submit its report, the panel had not agreed on what the recommendations should be. Thus, with only two weeks left in the quarter slated for the entire state creation exercise to be completed, the presidency had to issue an order for the committee to round up its work and submit a report to the head of state. The committee eventually did so on June 20, one month after the deadline. In the meantime, senior government officials and agencies had resorted to statements capable of undermining the work of the committee even before turning its recommendation in. Nasir was one such official. On several occasions, the TIC chairman openly condemned the agitation for states, thereby casting doubt on the sincerity of the government to go ahead with the exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That doubt was heightened by a position paper believed to have been sent to the presidency by the Economic Intelligence Monitoring Committee of Samuel Aluko, arguing that the nation's economy was incapable os sustaining additional states. To compound the situation, the FRCN and NTA, two governmental broadcast stations joined in the campaign of denigration against state creation. With such discordant tunes from the government camp itself, it became apparent that the exercise could in fact hamstring the transition programme. Such fears were hardly helped by yet more reports that the administration is again considering setting up a panel of inquiry to investigate allegations that members of the committee were bribed by state agitators during their nationwide verification tours. The obvious conclusion is that the government may take time to see its way through the miasma of states creation. At any rate, the delay in laying the exercise to rest has been held responsible for the postponement of the promulgation of the 1995 constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> States creation aside, the issue of tenure for councilors now being bandied by Ikoku and company as a possible barrier to the exit date is even more inexplicable. When the administration announced the time-table of October 1 last year, Nigerians expressed dismay at the logic of conducting two local government elections in one year, the first one on non-party basis.  Part of the criticisms then was that it would amount to a waste of resources: encourage graft in the elected officer; and help to distract attempts at party formation and registration. Several alternatives were suggested to the government. In fact, at the all-politician summit in December, the positions unequivocally rejected the plan to conduct council elections in March and December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the government rebuffed all suggestions. In reply, its officials argued that any alteration to the time-table will portray the government as unserious. Now the chickens are coming home to roost. The only apparent benefit seems to be that the non-party elections have provided a crop of loyalists to the administration at the grassroots level. As foreseen, the councilors are now importuning the state administrators and the presidency pleading for more time to enable them implement their programmes. Even now, many of the elected council officials are yet to settle down to business since they were inaugurated last March. They are still embroiled in election petitions against them at various tribunals, with many of the results being overtuned. Yet, the chaos in the third tier of government is now being cited as one of the compelling factors for a possible change in the handover date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the flows and ebbs in the transition programme, nothing seems to evoke the Babangida era more than the guidelines for party registration. Any hiccup arising from this part of the programme would appear to have been a wll orchestrated rehash from that past. Ironically, that is the major assignment for this quarter even as it seems doomed totatality. According to the requirements released three weeks ago, the associations have only four weeks to register a membership of 1,215 million each spread across all the states of the federation. The upshot is that the 23 associations which have procured their application forms at a cost of N500,000 each must recruit some 28 million Nigerians as card carrying members within this short period.  Coming in the midst of the apathy created by the annulment of the presidential election and the clamp down on party formation until only recently, no honest association can be expected to fulfill this portion of the guidelines. Even in the last presidential election that was open to all adult Nigerians, only 14 million votes were recorded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As if to make matters worse, the total population in some areas is less than the number of card-carrying party members required by the electoral authorities, Baba Galadima, an official of the All Nigeria Congress, has identified the federal capital territory, Abuja, as one such area. Says he: &quot;The 1991 census figure for Abuja was about 300,000, so if you ask all the associations to produce 15,000 members each, all that population put together is more than 40,000 above the population.&quot; Taraba State is another. Yet, the ultimate Everest that the parties must surmount lies elsewhere: it is the crippling requirement that they must submit passport photographs of all their members. This is one venture that will consume huge finances from the parties, and impose impossible logistic problems. Galadima again: &quot;I am not sure we have photographic materials worth N3 billion in this country even if the associations have the means and money to do it, the materials to perform that aspect cannot be obtained within the deadline.&quot; It is estimated that the political party would require N100 million to fulfill this requirement alone.  Along with other requirements, it is conservatively estimated that the financial burden on each party for meeting the deadline in a state is N16 million. That translates to about N480 million for an association. In the event, it is surperfluous to note that apart from merger talks, the associations are deeply confused as to how to begin to go about satisfying the monumental demands of the electoral authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like it was under the Babangida regime, the only recourse open to the fledgling associations is to falsify figures and documents for registration, a task that is equally arduous and financially demanding. Yet, such recourse provides the fertile ground for disqualification and labeling of the political class as fraudulent. Authoritative sources last week revealed that a task force of security agents has been set up to monitor the activities of politicians and members of the various associations. The reports of this task force will play a major role in government's decisions on the registration exercise. Theweek learnt that like in the Babangida days, a mass disqualification of political associations might recur. The government, it is believed, might not go the whole Babangida hog of disqualifying all the associations and creating its own parties as it was done in 1989. What Abacha may do, according to sources is to demand for a second registration exercise with a modified set of guidelines. By then, the transition programme would have been off the course, with the ostensibly fraudulent politicians to blame for it. As a source sees it, the object is not only to stall the transition process, but to impoverish the political class to attenuate their influence on the programme. If that scenario plays out, only paperweight political aspirants who are more amenable to the administration's wiles would be left in the political terrain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That route had been well trodden by Babangida. Just as the Abacha regime set up the constitutional conference to formulate a transition agenda, the Babangida regime impaneled a political bureau in 1986 to do preparatory work for a purportedly enduring transfer of power to civilians. That bureau, under Babangida's manipulation, was split, with some members recommending 1990 and others, 1994, for the handover of power, A committee appointed by Babangida himself settled for the half way date of 1992. Following impossible conditions for party registration, the administration disqualified 13 political associations that applied for registration for not meeting the requirements. It then proceeded to foist two government-created and sponsored political parties on the politicians. In 1992 when the presidential election became due, the administration encouraged a stalemate within the parties and thereafter disqualified the 23 aspirants. This necessitated an extension of the transition programme to 1993. Before the new exit date, the government inspired campaigns by certain individuals for Babangida to continue to rule.  Such campaigns like those of Arthur Nzeribe's Association for Better Nigeria stated that &quot;it is abundantly clear from the evaluation and assessment of the Transition Programme and the &quot;newbreed&quot; political and economic actors that Nigerians have so far not succeeded in laying a solid foundation for the Third Republic.&quot; From there, the obvious way was that &quot;the presidential elections should be held in October 1996 and the civilian president be sworn in on January 2, 1997.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unable to have its way at the bar of public opinion, the ABN took to the law courts where it created a gridlock of litigations under which the administration hid to nullify the presidential election held on June 12.  1993. When it came to Abacha's turn in 1993, he avoided the pitfall of naming a handover date. Its refrain then was its tenure would be brief and to be determined by the constitutional conference. Yet, when the conference in 1995 set the following year as handover date, the administration maneuvered the gathering into reversing itself and giving a blank cheque on which the government could write whatever tenure that pleased it. It did so on October 1, 1995 given itself an additional three years to the two it has spent. That period was supposed to embody a transition programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now the chorus singers urging more years of military rule are back in business. To this group belongs Umaru Bukar Mandara of the National Solidarity People's Alliance, NSPA. And the Zanna of Borno. On June 8, Shehu Shagari, told the press that he had successfully midwifed an association consisting of 115 clubs across the country. He said the association was committed to the continued stay in office of Abacha as head of government after 1998. The NSPA, he said, is motivated by the good policies of the administration. &quot;Nigerians,&quot; he said, &quot;have never had it so good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After his well-reported speech, there were reports that he was arrested.  However close family sources said he was never arrested. Is Mandara and his NSPA then Abacha's equivalent of Nzeribe's ABN? Like Nzeribe, Mandara received only a slap on the wrist from information minister Walter Ofonagoro, who warned him to desist from his campaign. According to the minister, the government was not prepared to have another type of ABN which disrupted the transition programme of ex-president Babangida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Curiously, Mandara's association was among those that picked registration forms for intending political parties. Also sharing Mandara's goal is Nzeribe. The former ABN chief is sponsoring another political group with the name of National Democratic Alliance, NDA. The NDA has declared that it is offering a platform for various categories of Nigerians, including serving military officers to aspire to elective offices. While the NDA was the first association to pick up registration form, Mandara's NSPA was the last, thus symbolically sandwiching all the other associations between them.  An omen? Like other politicians who are also routing for Abacha not to go on the appointed date. Hyde Onuaguluchi, a former gubernatorial aspirant of the defunct National Republican Convention, NRC, in Enugu State, is one. In an interview with Theweek, the reverend-businessman said: &quot;I think what we should ask ourselves is whether the time is ripe for a civilian president (or not).&quot; He further added that &quot;I think that the masses are happy with the sweeping changes going on in the society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These orchestrations raise the spectre of David Mark, a brigadier-general retired by Abacha in its first attempt at consolidating his hold on power. Mark in an interview with Newswatch in 1994 had claimed that while making plans to seize power from the interim government of Ernest Shonekan, Abacha and Oladipo Diya, the chief of general staff, had preferred a prolonged stay in power by the military. &quot;They wanted the regime to remain in power for a minimum of five years and a maximum of eight years.&quot; He said to fulfill his ambition, the Abacha government was adopting dilatory tactics such as &quot;the conference, probe panel et cetera.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even if the regime were stealing ideas from the Babangida regime, then it is doing so with added value of ingenuity. For example, instead of banning politicians as the Babangida regime did with Decree 25 of 1987, the Abacha government has continued to use security screening to preclude its &quot;enemies&quot; and their cronies from political power. Besides, the government has created policies which give it the twin advantage of clipping off the wings of over-ambitious politicians as well as winning public support. One such plan is the Failed Bank Tribunal Decree. The decree is aimed at restoring sanity to the finance sector by forcing individuals and corporation concerns who took loans and defaulted on the terms of payment, thereby contributing to the failure of many banks, to pay up or go to jail. The measures have sealed the fate of so many otherwise wealthy Nigerians who would have shown interest in politics or sponsored political parties. The seemingly undiscriminating application of the rules have won the government a lot of supporters. This policy-plan is one of the ostensible reasons why Onuaguluchi is pleading for more years for Abacha. Hear him: &quot;The masses are happy with the Failed Banks Tribunal and the idea that there is no sacred cow in the society. The looting process is being stopped. Why are we in a hurry for any change? But we shouldn't change for changing sake, the economy is stabilising. The government should be allowed to conclude its programme.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government is believed to have initiated such populist programmes to achieve exactly this kind of effect. The success of the Failed Bank Tribunal and the acceptance it has won the administration is encouraging it to set up another tribunal, this time around, to probe failed contracts and parastatals. Could the administration have synchronized this bold initiatives with the burgeoning campaign slogans of the Mandaras and the Onuaguluchis for such an exigent period as now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All said, such domestic clamour for Abacha's tenacity of office is unlikely to jell with the international community. And probably with local politicians and oppostion groups who are already up in arms. From Ibadan where Layi Balogun, a former SDP presidential aspirant and Lam Adesina, a member of the Peoples Progressive Party, PPP, spoke, to Kaduna where Umaru Dikko, former minister of transport, expressed his view, to Enugu, where Chekwas Okorie, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Congress, PDC, vented his spleen, they all saw the Ikoku signal as an ominous sign of things to come. To them, the 1998 date was sacrosanct. Bristles Balogun: &quot;The delay in the submission of reports on state creation is not enough a reason to alter the handover date.&quot; Ibrahim Mantu, a member of the Nigeria Centre Party warns: &quot;if it becomes absolutely necessary for the transition programme to be amended, such an amendment should be restricted to the (date of) creation of states, local government and approval of the draft constitution.&quot; He warned against tampering with the exit date and programme for the formation of political parties. For him, &quot;there is nowhere the creation of states or local governments can affect the transition process because what it involves is simply moving people into geographical boundaries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apparently jolted by developments, politicians have been canvassing among themselves for representatives of all the associations which took registration forms to meet with the government on the issue of guidelines and handover date. This idea was mooted by Dikko when he said that &quot;unless politicians advise government on grey areas of the guidelines and the reason to allow people to form parties in a simple way, money politics cannot be eliminated.&quot; The idea has now caught on with all the associations. That same concern is growing in international circles. Just last week, Shinsuke Hirai, Japan's ambassador to Nigerian said that his country is closely monitoring the transition programme and declared that its completion on schedule is &quot;the only antidote to the current stigma on Nigeria in the international community.&quot; Like Japan which has suspended all aid to Nigeria since 1993, the American government which hailed the recent releases of political detainees also expressed hope that the government will &quot;continue to take such steps to improve the credibility of its commitments to the transition to civilian democratic rule.&quot; The Americans have refused to give the government a breathing space even after the transition programme was unfolded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps, it is from the Commonwealth where Nigeria has only recently stanched the spate of sanctions against it that the government should expect the greatest resistance. While narrating the experience of the Nigerian delegation to London, Ikoku said other member nations showed outright aversion for continued military rule. He said &quot;we have been reminded again that the outside world is disgusted with military rule.&quot; As Ikoku said, though the Nigerian delegation returned home beating its chest for having scored a big diplomatic victory, the CMAG members were distrustful of all the promises of smooth and timely transition to civil rule made by the delegation. Ikoku again: &quot;Everywhere we go, they will say how are we sure it will not happen as it happened before (annulment).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some members of the commonwealth even took their suspicion to the level of proposing to finance and monitor the transition programme, an offer that was rejected by the Tom Ikimi-led delegation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In all this, the ultimate Abacha surprise might come from elsewhere. As he continues to make the political waters murky, he has taken corresponding pains at trying to score a bull's eye on the economic front. If he succeeds before the exit date in applying the brakes to the hemorrhaging economy and turns it back to health, he could rightly expect a grateful nation to allow him have a change of clothing. It is perhaps in that direction that Nigerians and indeed the international community, should read Abacha's lip, like that of the former American President George Bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What is more, he has examples aplenty on the West Coast - from Jerry Rawlings of Ghana through Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso to Mainassara of Niger. More are on the way.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - It was the continuation of the battle from another front. When last Monday, Dan Etete, minister of petroleum resources, hosted officials of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association, of the Department of Petroleum Resources branch in Lagos, Etete, for the umpteenth time, used the opportunity to assure the agitated unionist that he was solidly behind them in their agitation against the move to invite foreign inspectors for the nation's crude oil exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources at the closed door meeting called at the instance of the minister informed Theweek that Etete told the union members of his resolve to fight against the duplication of the functions of the department as such a move amounts to monumental waste of funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The controversy over the appointment of foreign inspectors to monitor crude oil exports came to a head early in the year when Ani claimed that he nation was losing about 150, 000 barrels of oil per day to buyers as a result of lapses of officials of DPR and those of other agencies charged with monitoring exports at the nation's terminals. The 150,000 barrels per day amount to eight per cent of the nation's total export of about 1.8 mbpd. Ani claimed to have had as his authorities the General Emmanuel Abisoye Panel of Enquiry on NNPC's report and that of the Major General Tajudeen Olanrewaju's panel which reviewed the report. Both reports are yet to be made public.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ani's pronouncement was, however, greeted with cynicism as officials of DPR and many oil analysts disputed the figure, insisting that there was no way Nigeria would have lost that much to overloading without adverse effect on producing companies and even the nation's budget. They insisted that contrary to Ani's pronouncement, the complaint from buyers has always been under loading, and that if there was overloading at all, it was nothing near Ani's figure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ani did not share this view and he made this clear. He went ahead last month to appoint two foreign firms - Global Inspection Services and Robinson International Agencies - to inspect the exportation and invoicing of crude oil at the terminals. Ani said their appointment would last two years at the first instance. Should the deal get the nod of the presidency, insiders claim that Nigeria would be poorer by about $330 million as payment for the two companies. Ani said the decree was in the offing to back up the new development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Etete, however, has not taken this move, which he sees as undue interference in his ministry's affairs, lightly. Last October, long before Ani went ahead to appoint the foreign inspectors, Etete, in a letter to Ani, made exclusively available to Theweek, had said: &quot;The appointment of any pre-shipment products inspection agent would be completely unnecessary. Such a measure would in fact be wasteful and only result in duplication of functions.&quot; He advised that &quot;the funds earmarked for such misadventure should be better used to adequately equip the technical arm of my ministry (the Department of Petroleum Resources) in order to improve the discharge of its statutory obligations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Theweek's investigations revealed that as at last week, the presidency was yet to make up its mind on who to support between Ani And Etete.  Impeccable sources told Theweek that because of Etete's strong protest Sani Abacha, the head of state, has written two letters to Etete asking for further clarification on the issue. Etete himself confirmed this last Monday when he told the unionists that Abacha himself is interested in the matter and that he has written to ask for more details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Information pieced together by Theweek shows that two weeks back, Etete and top officials of his ministry finalised a comprehensive policy proposal, which has been presented to the presidency. The presidency, according to sources, may have approved the proposal. One of the policy measures enumerated in the proposal is to make DPR a stronger, more responsive and well-funded outfit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Etete promised the unionists last Monday that DPR, in line with the proposal will also soon answer a new name. He, however, did not promise them the autonomous status which they have been demanding since 1988 when they were merged with the ministry of petroleum resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Etete, according to sources at the meeting, also assured the unionists that a number of governmental agencies and commissions are behind DPR and are convinced that the department, give all the necessary tools and right incentives, would perform efficiently. One of such commissions is the National Economic Intelligence Committee. Theweek's investigations revealed that the committee has remained a formidable opponent of Ani's invitation of the two foreign agents to the nation's oil terminals. The agency is said to hold strongly to the view that a foreign inspector working with multinational oil companies who are selling Nigeria's crude oil to foreign buyers may not necessarily protect the nation's interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This view tallies with that of officials of DPR, who in a letter to Abacha last month revealed that for the department to function effectively, it requires just about 10 percent of the $330 million which was likely to be paid to the two foreign firms. The department complained of non-availability of basic tools like helicopters and vehicles. The DPR had told the presidency in a memo last year that it required about N1 billion to function effectively. The department believes that this bill is not outrageous given the fact that it generates about N40 billion annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, it seems like the vital department is deprived of funds given the fact that for 1996, only N67 million is allocated to it as capital expenditure, an amount it says is hardly enough to meet its basic needs. More troubling is the fact that half-way into the year, only a paltry N6 million has been released to the department. So serious is the department's financial predicament that the staff have not been paid their salaries in the past three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Funds apart, the department insists that given the procedure for the exportation of crude oil, it is not possible to lose about 150,00 bpd through topping. Topping is used to describe any further loading of crude oil in any available space in the export ship after loading the nominated and approved quantity of crude oil at designated and approved terminals. Asked the unionists: &quot;Which terminal owner (i.e. oil producing companies) would allow her crude oil production to be given free to charge to a buyer?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Disputing the logic behind Ani's invitation of foreign inspectors to combat the alleged collaboration of government agencies with foreign buyers, the union raised a poser in their letter to Abacha: &quot;What will now happen under the wise men arrangement of appointing foreign inspecting agents to verify foreign oil producing companies, foreign terminals, foreign buyers, and foreign ships under the control of foreigners at the terminals?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The department's seemingly brilliant argument does not seem to have convinced Ani. Sources at the ministry of finance told Theweek last Thursday that Ani is pushing ahead for the promulgation of the decree heralding the arrival of the two foreign inspectors. He is also said to have continued the negotiations with the two foreign firms. Ani is said to be convinced that even if the overloading is not as high as 150,00 bpd, there are still cases of overloading and that only experts, in this case foreign ones, can set the records straight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Ani is working real hard to push his policy through, Etete too is said to have intensified lobby to make the presidency reject Ani's measures.  It is yet to be seen who among the two men will carry the day.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - It was a peculiar setting, not one of those coup plot stories already common in places like Nigeria and Ghana before 1984. For the first time since The Gambia became independent in 1965, the peace and tranquility of that tiny West African country was shattered that cool early morning of September 2, 1981 with the news that some junior military officers led by one rather obscure 28-year old called Koikoi Sambo Sanyang had sacked the 16-year old government of the revered President Dauda Jawara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Koikoi, a brave revolutionary, had seized the opportunity of the absence from home of Jawara, who was attending the royal wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana in London, to stage his coup. And his was successful until the Senegalese military intervened and drove away the rebels. Compared to the French-trained Senegalese troops, the Gambians were more or less boys' scouts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the end of the putsch, Jawara returned home to continue his reign while Koikoi fled into exile. Since that night when he left, he has been living in different countries in the West Africa sub-region: Ghana, Burkina Faso, Togo, Ivory Coast and Liberia, doing what he know best; supporting anti-government struggles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Theweek recently tracked down Koikoi in Ivory Coast and then met his close aides in The Gambia and Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Koikoi, according to sources, assisted in the revolution which brought Jerry Rawlings, then a redundant flight-lieutenant in Ghana, to power in 1981. But after the success of that revolution, Rawlings dumped Koikoi, who had to move to Burkina Faso, which was then brewing its own revolution under the leadership of Thomas Sankara, a captain the Burkinabe army. There, Koikoi met with Foday Sankoh, now the Rebel United Front of Sierra Leone, and Charles Taylor, leader of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia. The three men joined hands in organising their rebel forces to seize power in their different countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Koikoi's close aides, things didn't work out too well between Sankara and these three rebels, who believed that the only way to get to power was through the barrel of the gun. Given the cold shoulder by Sankara, the three teamed up with Blaise Compaore, a captain and Sankara's deputy and, assisted by the late Houphet-Boigny of Ivory Coast, eliminated Sankara, whom they considered a stumbling block to their ambitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After Compaore seized power, he compensated Koikoi and co by providing a base for them at Po in Burkina Faso for the training of their commandos.  According to the master plan of Taylor, Sankoh and Koikoi, three neighbouring countries were to be the target of the armed struggle. Sierra Leone was listed as the first to be attacked, but the rebels found a problem in late Samuel Doe who refused to give them a base to operate. They were to change their plans when in 1989, Houphouet-Boigny provided a base for them to attack Liberia under the banner of the NPFL. Koikoi became the artillery commander for the NPFL and lived in Buchanan, Liberia, as Taylor's second in command, with his Gambian troops heading various wings of the NPFL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in Liberia, like in Ghana, Koikoi's contributions were not adequately rewarded by Taylor, Koikoi soon left and returned to Burkina Faso, where he later had problems with Compaore over some ideological differences.  Frustrated, Koikoi had to go back to Ghana, to live with friends in a bungalow in Lapaz, a surburb of Accra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In frustration Koikoi later left for Togo, where things got worse for him. He fell sick and almost died. Miraculously, he survived. Some diplomatic moves were later made by the Nigerian government to get him to meet Yayah Jammeh, the new military leader of The Gambia and the second revolutionary to stage a coup there. Koikoi, however, suspected foul play in the initiative and refused to turn up in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, for the proposed meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For now, he lives a good lie in Danane, supported materially by friends who live abroad and from spoils from his men in the battle-fields of Liberia.  He is described as a devout family man though separated from his Burkinabe wife.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BANJUL, Gambia (PANA) - Gambia's military-led government will be two years in power on July 22, amid some apprehension over when exactly civilian rule will be restored in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although developments towards that goal have been in line, the military government has not yet made a clear move to liberalize the political system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those who say progress is being made were emboldened in their belief by the statement of the Commonwealth Action Group that its meeting in June with the Gambian leader, Capt.Yahya Jammeh, in Banjul, was a good one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group, comprising Canada, Ghana and New Zealand, is to review the progress Gambia and Nigeria are making towards civilian rule.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers of the Gambian political scene now say the remaining task for government is to lift the ban on political activity, imposed when it seized power July 22, 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In spite of the Commonwealth's positive statement, some detractors hold a different view and have pointed to various factors to support their cautiousness. Among them is a statement Jammeh made, at a recent rally, that the holding of elections depended on the Gambian people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On June 28, Jammeh, who heads the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council (AFPRC), was quoted by the state-owned newspaper, The Gambia Daily, as telling a traditional chief that &quot;there will soon be elections, as scheduled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Head of State said it is in the hands of the people of The Gambia, not the AFPRC -- just as the people had asked the AFPRC to rule for two years, not for the period of four years the Government had previously announced,&quot; the newspaper said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Skeptics saw contradictions in this position because the wishes of the people were expressed clearly when they objected to a four-year military administration proclaimed by Jammeh in October 1994. The feelings of Gambians on this issue were expressed in a January 1995 report by a National Consultative Committee, whose chairman was Lenrie Peters, a surgeon and poet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The four-year program Jammeh announced in October 1994 had engendered adverse reaction within and outside the country. It plunged many people into despondency and, by November 1994, mutinous soldiers engaged the AFPRC government in a futile and bloody counter-coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soon there were more political casualties: The government accused ousted Finance Minister Bakary Dabo, the only member of the former regime allowed to retain his cabinet post, of being the chief civilian co-conspirator in the foiled coup. He fled the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Next came a crippling economic measure taken by Britain. It issued a travel advisory warning British nationals to stay away from Gambia because of what it said was the unstable political and security situation there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Overnight, Gambia's tourist industry, which receives the majority of its visitors from the Britain, grounded to a halt as travel agents pulled out en masse. Most hotels closed operations, throwing at least 10,000 Gambians out of jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was during this period of national disquiet that the government, in December 1994, set up the National Consultative Committee to ask Gambians whether or not they agreed with the four-year transition timetable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two-year transition period preferred by Gambians caused division within the ranks of the AFPRC. Subsequently, the council's much disliked vice-chairman, Capt. Sana Sabally, and the Interior Minister, Sadibou Haidara, were arrested and detained for allegedly attempting to assassinate Capt. Jammeh. Haidara died in detention while Sabally was tried and sentenced to nine years in prison by a military tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the government accepted the consultative committee's report, it rejected recommendations for the installation of an interim government and for a National Consultative Committee on a new constitution, to be adopted after the proposed review of the country's 1970 constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, it appointed a Constitutional Review Commission under the chairmanship of a Ghanaian judge. Subsequently government was to hold a referendum at which the population would decide on whether or not to adopt the new constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nonetheless, the adoption of a two-year timetable gave the AFPRC government some respite. Many Gambians relaxed all opposition to it, so as not to provide the military with an excuse to extend its stay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the government adopted a two-pronged strategy of compressing its four-year programme within the stipulated two-year limit. It embarked on programmes ranging from civic education to constitutional review, voter registration, the appointment of an electoral commission and promised to unban political parties by March, 1996 -- some three months before elections in July, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nothing worked according to plan and problems piled up. Financial assistance from such traditional donors as the European Community, the United States and British governments were cut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Jammeh's government cultivated new friends in Libya and Taiwan.  Quickly, funds began to flow in for various development projects. These ranged from a new airport terminal to a national television service as well as to an up-country referral hospital and various middle and high schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A university extension programme was also developed with some Canadian institutions (Gambia has never had a university). Construction of a million dollar arch in commemoration of the July 22 takeover was also started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Various anti-corruption commissions were set up to probe the record of the ousted government. Initially meant to complete their work within a six month period, some of these commissions are still grinding on, even though the public no longer appears shocked by the revelations which had won many of them over to the military government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Belatedly, the constitution was finally reviewed by a Constitutional Review Commission. An official version has been published for public debate and input, prior to the presentation of a final version to a referendum scheduled for Aug. 7, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Provisional Independent Electoral Commission was also set up, late, and has been engaged in implementing the transition process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After consultation with the Government, it set the date for the referendum and for presidential elections at September 11, 1996, and parliamentary elections for December 11, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also embarked on the registration of voters, an exercise which was concluded June 22, 1996. But its Chairman, retired educationist Gabriel Roberts, has said that the lifting of the ban on party politics would have to be done by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gambians however wonder what the government's next move will be. They note the failure to meet past datelines and the activities of the July 22 Movement, which has been campaigning in favor of government policies and the extension of military rule under Jammeh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There feelings among Gambians that, like a good soldier, Jammeh could be seriously preparing for some other eventuality. Developments in the next few days will certainly show whatever eventuality, if any, that may be.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> YAOUNDE, Cameroon (PANA) - The Organization of African Unity has come out strongly on the side of Libya in its crisis with the United States, Britain and France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a draft resolution passed Saturday night, the OAU Council of Ministers meeting here called on the United Nations Security Council to lift the sanctions imposed on Libya.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The council warned that the continued imposition of sanctions against Libya &quot;may compel African states to look into possible means of sparing Libya further suffering&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The council also said it supports Libya in its demand for &quot;appropriate compensation&quot; for the loss of human lives and material damage inflicted as a result of the &quot;unjust sanctions&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Libya is under economic sanctions, including a ban on international air travel, imposed by the Security Council, following accusations that it harbored two men suspected of being involved in the bombing of an American airliner which crashed over Lockerbie, Scotland, several years ago. The sanctions were sponsored by the U.S., Britain and France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The council said it was convinced that the proposal made by Libya that the suspects be tried in the Hague by Scottish judges in accordance with Scottish law was acceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The proposal has enjoyed wide international support as &quot;a practical solution of the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ministers called on the US, Britain and France to consider this proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In brief statement to the council earlier, the head of the Libyan delegation said his country had never opted for confrontation with the three western countries and wanted to arrive at a quick solution acceptable to all the parties.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However the assassins, who managed to escape, killed a security officer and a policemen, Addis Ababa radio reported.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hussein, the transport and communications minister, was wounded in the arm, the radio said, quoting a government spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The gunmen opened fire as Hussein was stepping out of his car to go to his office in the ministry building in central Addis Ababa. The incident took place at about 8.30 a.m. (0530 GMT).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two assailants were reported to have escaped in a car they seized at gun point. They were described as young men with Somali features. The hijacked car was later found some three kilometers from the scene of the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hussein is chairman of the Ethiopian Somali Democratic League, the ruling party in the Ethiopian Somali region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A number of Ethiopian Somali opposition groups accuse the league, and Hussein, of rigging Ethiopia's 1995 federal and state elections. Prominent among the accusers has been the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which has been at odds with the league and the federal government. The Ogaden front has launched occasional attacks on government forces in the vast Ogaden area of eastern Ethiopia. Hussein has been closely identified with the ruling Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front, since the fall of Ethiopia's Marxist regime in May 1991. He served as external relations and cooperation minister until a multiparty federal government was formed in Ethiopia in August 1995.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at a Maputo news briefing, Mocumbi said he thought &quot;it would be unjust not to allow Boutros-Ghali a second term.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States administration is said it will not support a second term for Boutros-Ghali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mocumbi declined to comment on the United States position. However, he noted it was normal practice to allow a UN Secretary-General serve a second term of office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said there would have to be &quot;very strong reasons&quot; -- such as the death of or an incapacitating illness -- for a change to occur only at the end of the first term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mocumbi doubted that within the next two or three months a new candidate could appear &quot;with a serious plan for restructuring the UN.&quot; He feared that any new plan produced would have been drawn up in haste, and would be worthless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We defend the interests of Africa, and we have to assess what Boutros-Ghali has done for Africa, how he has carried out his promises, and what proposals he has for a second term,&quot; said the prime minister.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria's military government has accused Cameroon of rejecting peace overtures and opting for a military solution to the dispute over the oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An official statement issued late Sunday accused Cameroon of preparing to launch a major military offensive against Nigeria.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tom Ikimi, Nigeria's foreign minister, said in the statement that &quot;Cameroon is actively engaged in a massive troop build-up and mobilization of heavy military equipment along our frontier.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Cameroon was doing this with the &quot;full support and involvement of international collaborators and professional mercenaries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement came ahead of the annual summit of African leaders that opened Monday in the Cameroonian capital, Yaounde. It was also in response to a letter dated June 19, 1996, from the Cameroonian foreign minister, Ferdinand Oyono, alleging that Nigeria had been amassing troops along the border since May 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oyono also said the Nigerian government was constructing structures, including a police station, in parts of the of peninsula in the Gulf of Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ikimi dismissed the allegations as &quot;baseless&quot; and accused Cameroon of constantly showing total disregard for international law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria and Cameroon have been engaged in a longstanding dispute over ownership of the Bakassi Peninsula, rich in oil and maritime resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both countries have stationed troops on their sides of the peninsula and have constantly blamed one another for breaking the uneasy cease-fire established in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two countries have referred the matter to the International Court of Justice for a solution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BANJUL, Gambia (PANA) - Gambia's military-led government will be two years in power on July 22, amid some apprehension over when exactly civilian rule will be restored in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although developments towards that goal have been in line, the military government has not yet made a clear move to liberalize the political system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those who say progress is being made were emboldened in their belief by the statement of the Commonwealth Action Group that its meeting in June with the Gambian leader, Capt.Yahya Jammeh, in Banjul, was a good one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group, comprising Canada, Ghana and New Zealand, is to review the progress Gambia and Nigeria are making towards civilian rule.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers of the Gambian political scene now say the remaining task for government is to lift the ban on political activity, imposed when it seized power July 22, 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In spite of the Commonwealth's positive statement, some detractors hold a different view and have pointed to various factors to support their cautiousness. Among them is a statement Jammeh made, at a recent rally, that the holding of elections depended on the Gambian people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On June 28, Jammeh, who heads the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council (AFPRC), was quoted by the state-owned newspaper, The Gambia Daily, as telling a traditional chief that &quot;there will soon be elections, as scheduled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Head of State said it is in the hands of the people of The Gambia, not the AFPRC -- just as the people had asked the AFPRC to rule for two years, not for the period of four years the Government had previously announced,&quot; the newspaper said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Skeptics saw contradictions in this position because the wishes of the people were expressed clearly when they objected to a four-year military administration proclaimed by Jammeh in October 1994. The feelings of Gambians on this issue were expressed in a January 1995 report by a National Consultative Committee, whose chairman was Lenrie Peters, a surgeon and poet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The four-year program Jammeh announced in October 1994 had engendered adverse reaction within and outside the country. It plunged many people into despondency and, by November 1994, mutinous soldiers engaged the AFPRC government in a futile and bloody counter-coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soon there were more political casualties: The government accused ousted Finance Minister Bakary Dabo, the only member of the former regime allowed to retain his cabinet post, of being the chief civilian co-conspirator in the foiled coup. He fled the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Next came a crippling economic measure taken by Britain. It issued a travel advisory warning British nationals to stay away from Gambia because of what it said was the unstable political and security situation there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Overnight, Gambia's tourist industry, which receives the majority of its visitors from the Britain, grounded to a halt as travel agents pulled out en masse. Most hotels closed operations, throwing at least 10,000 Gambians out of jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was during this period of national disquiet that the government, in December 1994, set up the National Consultative Committee to ask Gambians whether or not they agreed with the four-year transition timetable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two-year transition period preferred by Gambians caused division within the ranks of the AFPRC. Subsequently, the council's much disliked vice-chairman, Capt. Sana Sabally, and the Interior Minister, Sadibou Haidara, were arrested and detained for allegedly attempting to assassinate Capt. Jammeh. Haidara died in detention while Sabally was tried and sentenced to nine years in prison by a military tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the government accepted the consultative committee's report, it rejected recommendations for the installation of an interim government and for a National Consultative Committee on a new constitution, to be adopted after the proposed review of the country's 1970 constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, it appointed a Constitutional Review Commission under the chairmanship of a Ghanaian judge. Subsequently government was to hold a referendum at which the population would decide on whether or not to adopt the new constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nonetheless, the adoption of a two-year timetable gave the AFPRC government some respite. Many Gambians relaxed all opposition to it, so as not to provide the military with an excuse to extend its stay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the government adopted a two-pronged strategy of compressing its four-year programme within the stipulated two-year limit. It embarked on programmes ranging from civic education to constitutional review, voter registration, the appointment of an electoral commission and promised to unban political parties by March, 1996 -- some three months before elections in July, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nothing worked according to plan and problems piled up. Financial assistance from such traditional donors as the European Community, the United States and British governments were cut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Jammeh's government cultivated new friends in Libya and Taiwan.  Quickly, funds began to flow in for various development projects. These ranged from a new airport terminal to a national television service as well as to an up-country referral hospital and various middle and high schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A university extension programme was also developed with some Canadian institutions (Gambia has never had a university). Construction of a million dollar arch in commemoration of the July 22 takeover was also started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Various anti-corruption commissions were set up to probe the record of the ousted government. Initially meant to complete their work within a six month period, some of these commissions are still grinding on, even though the public no longer appears shocked by the revelations which had won many of them over to the military government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Belatedly, the constitution was finally reviewed by a Constitutional Review Commission. An official version has been published for public debate and input, prior to the presentation of a final version to a referendum scheduled for Aug. 7, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Provisional Independent Electoral Commission was also set up, late, and has been engaged in implementing the transition process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After consultation with the Government, it set the date for the referendum and for presidential elections at September 11, 1996, and parliamentary elections for December 11, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also embarked on the registration of voters, an exercise which was concluded June 22, 1996. But its Chairman, retired educationist Gabriel Roberts, has said that the lifting of the ban on party politics would have to be done by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gambians however wonder what the government's next move will be. They note the failure to meet past datelines and the activities of the July 22 Movement, which has been campaigning in favor of government policies and the extension of military rule under Jammeh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There feelings among Gambians that, like a good soldier, Jammeh could be seriously preparing for some other eventuality. Developments in the next few days will certainly show whatever eventuality, if any, that may be.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a draft resolution passed Saturday night, the OAU Council of Ministers meeting here called on the United Nations Security Council to lift the sanctions imposed on Libya.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The council warned that the continued imposition of sanctions against Libya &quot;may compel African states to look into possible means of sparing Libya further suffering&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The council also said it supports Libya in its demand for &quot;appropriate compensation&quot; for the loss of human lives and material damage inflicted as a result of the &quot;unjust sanctions&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Libya is under economic sanctions, including a ban on international air travel, imposed by the Security Council, following accusations that it harbored two men suspected of being involved in the bombing of an American airliner which crashed over Lockerbie, Scotland, several years ago. The sanctions were sponsored by the U.S., Britain and France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The council said it was convinced that the proposal made by Libya that the suspects be tried in the Hague by Scottish judges in accordance with Scottish law was acceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The proposal has enjoyed wide international support as &quot;a practical solution of the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ministers called on the US, Britain and France to consider this proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In brief statement to the council earlier, the head of the Libyan delegation said his country had never opted for confrontation with the three western countries and wanted to arrive at a quick solution acceptable to all the parties.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - A senior Ethiopian minister, Abdulmegid Hussein, escaped assassination Monday, by two assailants in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However the assassins, who managed to escape, killed a security officer and a policemen, Addis Ababa radio reported.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hussein, the transport and communications minister, was wounded in the arm, the radio said, quoting a government spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The gunmen opened fire as Hussein was stepping out of his car to go to his office in the ministry building in central Addis Ababa. The incident took place at about 8.30 a.m. (0530 GMT).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two assailants were reported to have escaped in a car they seized at gun point. They were described as young men with Somali features. The hijacked car was later found some three kilometers from the scene of the shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hussein is chairman of the Ethiopian Somali Democratic League, the ruling party in the Ethiopian Somali region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A number of Ethiopian Somali opposition groups accuse the league, and Hussein, of rigging Ethiopia's 1995 federal and state elections. Prominent among the accusers has been the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which has been at odds with the league and the federal government. The Ogaden front has launched occasional attacks on government forces in the vast Ogaden area of eastern Ethiopia. Hussein has been closely identified with the ruling Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front, since the fall of Ethiopia's Marxist regime in May 1991. He served as external relations and cooperation minister until a multiparty federal government was formed in Ethiopia in August 1995.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at a Maputo news briefing, Mocumbi said he thought &quot;it would be unjust not to allow Boutros-Ghali a second term.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States administration is said it will not support a second term for Boutros-Ghali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mocumbi declined to comment on the United States position. However, he noted it was normal practice to allow a UN Secretary-General serve a second term of office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said there would have to be &quot;very strong reasons&quot; -- such as the death of or an incapacitating illness -- for a change to occur only at the end of the first term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mocumbi doubted that within the next two or three months a new candidate could appear &quot;with a serious plan for restructuring the UN.&quot; He feared that any new plan produced would have been drawn up in haste, and would be worthless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We defend the interests of Africa, and we have to assess what Boutros-Ghali has done for Africa, how he has carried out his promises, and what proposals he has for a second term,&quot; said the prime minister.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria's military government has accused Cameroon of rejecting peace overtures and opting for a military solution to the dispute over the oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An official statement issued late Sunday accused Cameroon of preparing to launch a major military offensive against Nigeria.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tom Ikimi, Nigeria's foreign minister, said in the statement that &quot;Cameroon is actively engaged in a massive troop build-up and mobilization of heavy military equipment along our frontier.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Cameroon was doing this with the &quot;full support and involvement of international collaborators and professional mercenaries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement came ahead of the annual summit of African leaders that opened Monday in the Cameroonian capital, Yaounde. It was also in response to a letter dated June 19, 1996, from the Cameroonian foreign minister, Ferdinand Oyono, alleging that Nigeria had been amassing troops along the border since May 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oyono also said the Nigerian government was constructing structures, including a police station, in parts of the of peninsula in the Gulf of Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ikimi dismissed the allegations as &quot;baseless&quot; and accused Cameroon of constantly showing total disregard for international law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria and Cameroon have been engaged in a longstanding dispute over ownership of the Bakassi Peninsula, rich in oil and maritime resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both countries have stationed troops on their sides of the peninsula and have constantly blamed one another for breaking the uneasy cease-fire established in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two countries have referred the matter to the International Court of Justice for a solution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Following is a statement issued by the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) July 8, 1996 on the country's continuing debate over a new constitution:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Business S.A. the National Party, the Democratic Party and the Inkatha Freedom Party, all parties with a track-record of opposition to the advancement of workers interests, are appealing to the Constitutional Court to find that South Africa's working people have been given too many rights under the new Constitution and that for this reason the new Constitution should be found not to comply with the principles agreed upon during the Codesa negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> COSATU is confident that the labour-related aspects of the new Constitution are in accordance with the Constitutional Principles and has instructed legal Counsel to defend these aspects of the Constitution. COSATU rejects the attempt by minority parties, who found insufficient support for their views in the democratically elected Constitutional Assembly, to use the certification procedure simply to take a second- bite at the cherry- hoping to misuse the certification process for political ends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The objecting parties have focused their attack on three areas;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * the exclusion of a lock-out right,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * the entrenchment of collective bargaining for employers organisation, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * a clause which deals with the validity of the Labour Relations Act in terms of the interim constitutions. and requires a process of consultation with business and labour before it may be amended (s241).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The legal arguments are summarised below in broad terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Business South Africa is amongst the objectors on the point it is noteworthy that significant business constituencies, namely lack business in the form of FABCOS( a BSA affiliate) and NAFCOC have made it clear that they do not support BSA'S application to oppose the certification of the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NO RIGHT TO LOCK-OUT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The objectors argue that a right to lock-out should be included in the new Constitution on the basis that it is necessary to enforce their right to collective bargaining (guaranteed in terms of Principle 28), that it is required in terms of the right to equality (Principle 5), that it is required in terms of the guarantee that all &quot;universally accepted fundamental rights&quot; would be included and that &quot; due consideration&quot; would be given to the rights in the interim constitution (Principle 2)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> COSATU's response is that none of the Principles placed an obligation on the Constitutional Assembly to include a lock-our right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Principle 28's guarantee to employers of their right to collective bargaining is included in the constitution at s23(4). COSATU reject the employers' assertion that they require the right to lock-out workers as part of their right to collective bargaining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Principle 5's guarantee of equality is relevant to the relationship between &quot;men and women and people of different races&quot;. Therefore, it cannot in law be used as a basis for justifying a lock-out right in order to bring equality between workers and bosses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Secondly, Principle 5 is a guarantee of substantive, not merely formal, equality. In other words, to give employers the right to lock-out merely because workers have been given the right to strike would have the effect of entrenching the power of bosses in the name of equal treatment. It would have the effect of neutralizing the impact of the right to strike which was recognised in order to bring creater parity in the worker- employer relationship in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Principle 2's guarantee that &quot;universally accepted fundamental rights&quot; should be included in the Constitution has not been breached because the lock-out is not a universally accepted fundamental right. In fact, very few countries include a right to lock-out in their Constitution's and, unlike the right to strike, no international legal instruments elevate it to the status of a universally accepted right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Secondly, Principle 2's guarantee that &quot;due consideration&quot; would be given to the rights contained in the Interim Constitution has also been fulfilled. The Constitutional Assembly's records of the deliberations over, and ultimate rejection of, a lock-out right bear testimony to the process of &quot;due consideration &quot;. Also it should be born in mind that the lock-out was treated as something less than a right in the Interim Constitution, i.e. it was treated as a &quot;recourse&quot; which should not be impaired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> COLLECTIVE BARGAINING FOR EMPLOYERS&quot; ORGANISATION.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The objectors argue that, in terms of Principle 28, individual employers should be guaranteed the right to collective bargaining and that the right should not be granted to employers' organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> COSATU responds to this argument by saying that the correct interpretation of Principle 28 is that it grants collective bargaining rights to employers as a class and employees as a class. Secondly, the fact that individual employers can assert their right to collective bargaining based on the guarantee of fair labour practices adds weight to the contention that Principle 28 should be interpreted to guarantee collective bargaining between trade unions and employers' organisations at a centralised level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Principle 28 were to be destructively interpreted as only providing the right to individual employers then centralised bargaining would be jeopardised as individual employers would be able to opt out of centralised bargaining on the basis that they had a right to bargaining at an individual level. On the other hand, protection of collective bargaining for employers organisations ( at a centralised level) does not preclude bargaining at the level of the individual level. On the other hand, protection of collective bargaining for employers organisations (at a centralised level) does not preclude bargaining at the level of the individual employers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> S241 PROTECTION OF THE LABOUR RELATIONS ACT (LRA) AND THE PROCEDURE OF ITS AMENDMENT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The objectors argue that this section breaches Principle 4 which states that the &quot;Constitution shall be the supreme law of the land&quot; in that the section immunises the LRA from constitutional scrutiny. It is ironic that the objectors should raise problems with s241 as it was inserted in the Constitution as a result their insistence that the lock- out provisions in the LRA would be vulnerable to a constitutional challenge if there was no lock-out right in the Constitution, hence the necessity to include a clause (s241) designed to protect the LRA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> COSATU's response to this argument is that as it is the constitution itself which is defining its scope and ambit the clause does not undermine the constitution's supremacy. In effect, all that the Constitution is setting out to do through s241 is to give its blessing to a set of provisions in the LRA until such are amended through a process of consultation. Such a mechanism is not unprecedented as almost identical provisions dealing with labour relations were included in the Interim Constitution at s33(5).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An alternative argument is that s241 means that the provisions of the LRA which are constitutionally valid in terms of the Interim Constitution &quot;remain valid&quot;, but that those that are not valid could be subject to Constitutional view.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York - Text of a letter from William A. Orme, Jr., executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) to Abdou Diouf, the president of Senegal, July 3, 1996:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) writes to protest the fines and sentences imposed on the Sud Communication media group and on five journalists with the independent newspaper, &quot;Sud Quotidien&quot;: Abdoulaye Ndiaga Sylla, Sidy Gaye, Bocar Niang, Mame Oll Faye and Ibrahim Sarr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sud Communication, the privately-owned Senegalese media company, was fined on June 27, 1996 CFA 500 million (US$1 million) for public defamation of the Mimran Group, a sugar importing company. Judge Abdoulaye Diouf of the court for petty offenses ordered Sud Communication to pay the fine to Jean Claude Mimran, president of the Mimran Group. In addition, Judge Diouf sentenced Ndiaga Sylla, first vice-president of Sud Communication and director of &quot;Sud Quotidien&quot;; Gaye, editor-in-chief of &quot;Sud Quotidien&quot;; and Niang, Oll Faye and Sarr, reporters for the newspaper, to one month in jail.  Babacar Toure, chairperson and president of Sud Communication, was acquitted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sud Communication was sued for an article in the 13 October 1995 edition of &quot;Sud Quotidien.&quot; The article revealed the Mimran Group's alleged fraudulent practices in importing sugar from Brazil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a nonpartisan group of journalists committed to the defense of press freedom worldwide, the Committee to Protect Journalists contends that the fines and sentences imposed on the journalists of Sud Communication are excessive and unjustified. CPJ opposes the use of criminal defamation as it is a blatant violation of the right to a free and independent press. We urge Your Excellency to intervene on the side of press freedom and call for the reversal of the convictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank you for your attention. We welcome your comments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Control the water flow, remove the fertile silt deposition of annual floods, and fragile ecosystems are broken. Ancient peoples are placed under threat. What way of life is left for a Marsh Arab with no marsh?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The villages of Lesotho are dirt poor. The &quot;white gold&quot; rushing across the contours of fierce streams has not filled the bank accounts of the blanket-clad Basotho.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, they have been forced to abandon the craggy compounds of their forefathers., to let their homes be swallowed by the rising waters of vast reservoirs behind concrete dams.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Engineers know there is an unwritten scale of political clout. Build a dam in the middle of Johannesburg and a lot of well-educated people living nearby equates to a lot of fuss and that's potentially expensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Build a dam amid the mountains of Lesotho and hell, you don't even have to make a thorough geological survey.

They can be scared half rigid because theirs is a silent scream on the dollar index. And so, as the media briefly noticed, half a dozen huts tumbled in a Lesotho village. But the ripple on the stock exchange pond was short-lived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When a crack tore through Mapaleng (90km south-east of Ficksburg), no one even knew there was an old fault there.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By early this year 1 600ha of arable land had been lost around Katse, as well as 3 200ha of grazing land, 3 000 trees and 17ha of gardens. Some of the 63 villages seriously affected will eventually be entirely relocated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in the meantime the hillsides are still quaking, especially after last summer's heavy rainfall. Unlike at the start of the project, the seismic stations are all working.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is just as well because authorities admit there are &quot;possibly hundreds&quot; of other faults around Katse reservoir. At least four other villages have been noticeably shaken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier this year, the level of earthquakes around Katse -- 16 of them in a month, 37 in the next - -- reached level VII on the internationally used Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harare - Zimbabwe's embattled gay community, the target of an abusive campaign last year by President Robert Mugabe and Zimbabwean church leaders, is bracing for another confrontation with the same opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A proposal by international Protestant umbrella body, the World Council of Churches (WCC), to hold its 1998 assembly in Zimbabwe has led to early skirmishing in which the president of the Zimbabwe Council of Churches (ZCC), Anglican bishop of Harare Jonathan Siyachitema, has repeated anti-gay remarks made last year when he supported Mugabe's view that gays and lesbians had &quot;no rights whatsoever&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This time, however, the country's small gay advocacy organisation, Galz (Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe), believes it has considerable leverage. The WCC is insisting on dialogue over the gay rights issue ahead of the assembly and wants gay delegates to be able to hold demonstrations on the University of Zimbabwe campus where the meeting will be held. Over 3500 delegates and 200 journalists are expected to attend.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ZCC has moved quietly behind the scenes to assure the WCC its delegates will not be harassed or barred from entering the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Siyachitema, however, continues to adopt a combative posture saying that while gay rights will be on the WCC agenda, &quot;homosexuality is a sin and there can be no compromise on that&quot;. He said he was grateful the government had taken a strong stance against homosexuality in accordance with church principles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The gathering at the University of Zimbabwe will be open for discussion on the topic but if people want to masquerade as homosexuals from the university we declare that the law must take its course,&quot; Siyachitema warned in remarks clearly directed at Galz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, other church spokesmen said the bishop had gone too far, and accused him of &quot;political appeasement&quot;. Siyachitema's remarks were &quot;most unfortunate and compromised the pastoral responsibilities of the church&quot;, said Jonah Gokova, co-ordinator of Ecumenical Support Services, a church-related non-governmental organisation helping to prepare for the WCC assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> David Hatendi, the former Anglican bishop of Harare, last week called for the government and ZCC to set up a commission of inquiry into homosexuality ahead of the 1998 meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Representatives of Galz met a church group last week to determine a basis for dialogue. Galz's organisational capacity has been boosted by the donation of Z$600 000 (nearly R300 000) from Dutch funding agency Hivos with more to come next year, a move that is bound to infuriate Mugabe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Galz can play a prominent role in building a plural and democratic society,&quot; said Hivos director Jan Vossen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mugabe's anti-gay campaign last year ran into strong opposition from foreign governments and South African civics. The president is however believed to be still looking for ways to promote Zimbabwe as an &quot;Africanist&quot; alternative to Nelson Mandela's rainbow nation. Asked recently about hostile global reaction to his gay-bashing, Mugabe said &quot;the world can go to hell&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last weekend Galz held a well-attended gay pride party in Harare, marking the anniversary of Stonewall.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - President Nelson Mandela's tendency to &quot;shoot from the hip&quot; on foreign policy matters -- a trait which is the despair of diplomats, but admired by others as straight talking -- was on display again this week when he panned the British prime minister on the eve of his state visit to the United Kingdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a briefing for British correspondents at his Houghton home, Mandela criticised John Major for failing to take more of a lead in applying international sanctions against Nigeria.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said United States President Bill Clinton was prepared to apply &quot;some measure of sanctions&quot;, but he was having &quot;difficulties&quot; with the British premier, who was stalling on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela said Major was insisting that Britain would only take such action if he was sure &quot;all other countries&quot; would follow suit. Major was also arguing that Britain's contribution to a sanctions campaign could only be nominal, because the UK purchased little oil from Nigeria. &quot;I couldn't get him to be up-front on the question,&quot; Mandela said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Protesting at the &quot;clamour&quot; for him to use his &quot;so- called moral authority&quot; with Nigeria, the president said it was up to countries like the US, Britain and France to force change on the military regime through their trade links.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said, however, that his government was not prepared to provide facilities and support in South Africa for Nigerian resistance groups, because &quot;it would not be consistent with efforts we are making to resolve this matter peacefully&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Traditions steeped in centuries of British history will change next week when Queen Elizabeth II pulls out all the stops to honour her guest for a week, President Nelson Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even Oxford University's ceremonial pomp will have to travel to Buckingham Palace to join seven other universities in the garden next Wednesday to bestow honorary degrees on Mandela. No less than 15 universities have offered Mandela degrees -- unprecedented for any visiting head of state to Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This will also be the first time in the history of the United Kingdom that degrees are bestowed at Buckingham Palace. The arrangements were made by the palace to spare Mandela trips to each university during his hectic visit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela will become the first head of state since John F Kennedy to address both British Houses of Parliament. He and daughter Zenani will be accommodated in Buckingham Palace's sumptuous Belgian Suite, an honour usually reserved for leaders of nations far more powerful in global terms than South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The royal family is playing a far more prominent role in Mandela's visit than it does when many other heads of state visit. The invitation to visit Britain was issued by the queen after she visited South Africa last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After his arrival at Heathrow, just before midday on Tuesday, Mandela will be met by Princess Anne and will be escorted to the Horse Guards Parade to greet the queen and Prince Philip. They will then set out along the most ceremonial of all parade routes, down the Mall to Buckingham Palace, with the stately avenue decked out in South African and British flags.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The queen will host a state banquet on Tuesday in honour of Mandela, who will reciprocate with a luncheon for the queen and Prince Philip at the Dorchester Hotel on Thursday. They will not be his only guests, though -- trade union officials and businessmen have also been invited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela will also visit the Queen Mother for tea at Clarence House on Tuesday, and Prince Charles will accompany him on a tour of the largely black suburb of Brixton on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela and the queen will not only meet on formal occasions. They will attend a concert titled Two Nations Celebrate at the Royal Albert Hall, where top international artists like Quincy Jones, Phil Collins and Hugh Masekela will perform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers in Britain this week said the royal family's personal admiration for Mandela was evident in the arrangements made for his official visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They added that the queen had had a long-standing interest in South African politics: &quot;She differed with Margeret Thatcher on South Africa, and what is emerging now is that she had firmly supported the Commonwealth's call for sanctions against South Africa during the mid-1980s at a time when Thatcher received PW Botha at Downing Street and branded the ANC a terrorist organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The one influential title the queen has retained is head of the Commonwealth. It was during the royal family's visit to South Africa in the late 1940s that she dedicated her life to the service of the Commonwealth at the tender age of 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;She sees her role in the Commonwealth as distinct from queen of England. After all, many countries entered the Commonwealth seeking protection of the British sovereign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a packed programme, Mandela will also meet Prime Minister John Major, Labour Party leader Tony Blair, Liberal Democratic Party leader Paddy Ashdown and Commonwealth Secretary General Chief Emeka Anyaoku.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He ends his visit next Friday with a walk through Trafalgar Square and an appearance on the balcony of South Africa House. He sets off for a state visit to France from July 13 to 16, at the invitation of President Jacques Chirac.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The young bull elephant that charged a group of tourists in the Pilanesberg Game Reserve last week and killed the professional hunter who went to shoot it the next day are the latest victims of a new set of economic and political problems troubling the managers of South Africa's burgeoning game reserve industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two years ago a German tourist was trampled to death by another rogue elephant in the Pilanesberg. Soon after that attack, a lion at a privately owned park called Phinda Izilwane (&quot;the return of the animals&quot;) stalked and killed a tourist inside the reserve's luxury lodge. Last month a rhino gored a young ranger to death in a Botswana reserve. This year a wounded giraffe kicked the life out of a conservation official in the Northern Province.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And a group of foreign tourists were recently involved in a near-fatal incident at the Hluhluwe Game Reserve when an elephant charged their open-air vehicle. It would appear humans are not the only casualties in the recent offensive on the part of wild animals in the country's game reserves. Nearly 20 white rhinos, worth R60 000 each, have been mauled to death in the Pilanesberg by elephant herds showing increasing signs of pathological behaviour -- including aberrant efforts to mate with rhino cows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A debate is beginning to grow around the most recent incident in the Pilanesberg. Specialists from the Rhino and Elephant Foundation, regarded as one of the world's best elephant research institutions, believe these could be the unanticipated symptoms of a huge increase in trade and translocation of wild animals that were made to roam freely across the plains of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is as though the animals are beginning to bite back. They are being hunted, culled, captured, transported and shunted into small and closed game reserves,&quot; says an ecologist who asked not to be named as he has been involved in the investigation into the Pilanesberg incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;And not enough research is being done about the impact such practices have on these dangerous beasts. What we may be seeing are early warning signs that conservationists may have been playing God with the animals without anticipating the consequences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bull elephant at the centre of the Pilanesberg tragedy was an orphan taken either from a matriarchal herd in the Addo Elephant Park in the Eastern Cape or from a herd that was killed during the Kruger National Park's controversial culling programme in the early 1980s. Most elephants in the Hluhluwe Game Reserve are also the orphaned products of Kruger's culls -- and ecologists are beginning to believe aggressive behaviour by these animals in both reserves are early signs of the trauma and stress the animals have been subjected to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Until this year the National Parks Board killed a few hundred elephant in the Kruger Park each year on the grounds that this was neccessary to prevent the park from being overpopulated. During the cull, which involved darting adult animals with a paralysing agent from the air and then shooting them, the youngsters were rounded up and exported to other game reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The practice has allowed South African conservationists to reintroduce elephant into areas of the country where they had become extinct. But it is possible that the orphaned elephants were traumatised by the mass killing that took place around them. And, in many cases, the youngsters were sent to game reserves where there were no matriarchs to care for and discipline them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We would need to monitor the behaviour of these animals for at least another 10 years before we can say with scientific certainty that the culling programme is a direct cause of the anti-social behaviour on the part of young elephant bulls who were translocated,&quot; says Marion Gara, who coordinates pachyderm research at the Rhino and Elephant Foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She points out that there have been attacks on tourists by aggressive elephants in game reserves where culling does not occur and where the herds are not made up of translocated animals, and that there is probably a host of factors explaining the strange behaviour of the Pilanesberg's pachyderms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from the absence of matriarchal discipline, the young bulls have grown into adulthood without the presence of older and more mature bulls. The older bulls appear to be an important balancing factor, especially when the young ones are in musth (ready to mate). When they are forced to compete with the old bulls, they are forced to retreat and calm down sexually. Without this process, it seems the animals take out their frustration on other species in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Scientists at Pilanesberg have established that the problem bull was in musth last week and believe this may have contributed to its aggressive behaviour. Park officials also have photographs of male elephants trying to mount female rhinos. They believe sexual and territorial aggression by the young elephant bulls may explain why most of the 19 rhinos gored to death by elephants in the past few years were all cows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another factor that influences the behaviour of dangerous animals is that most South African game reserves, with the exception of the Kruger, are small and closed systems -- unlike the vast, open game reserves of the type in East Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe, where natural processes are able to operate with less human interference than that which takes place in South African reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Charles Ndabeni, a senior official in the public relations division of the North West Parks Board, says all of the explanations for the recent attack in Pilanesberg are being investigated by a team of scientists in the game reserve. &quot;A full report is being compiled by this team and will be distributed as and when requested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The acting director of North West Parks, on behalf of the board, further offers its sincere and deep condolences to the bereaved family of Ricky Walsh, the hunter who was killed last week. Walsh is survived by his wife and two children.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maputo - Sabati Omar breaks from his work building a mosque to explain how Islam is growing in Boane, a rural area in southern Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Every month we see somebody convert,&quot; says Omar, 25, who has taken time off from his job at a general store to help build the domed mosque. &quot;People are attracted because they see strength in our religion. They see how hard we work, how we lead clean lives. Our faith gives hope to poor people.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The growth of Islam in Mozambique is provoking controversy as the religion begins to flex its political muscle. parliament has passed a law to make the two days of Eid -- which mark the end of the fasting month of Ramadan -- public holidays. The bill was introduced by parliament's 59 Muslim members and backed by the ruling Frelimo party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Roman Catholics and other Christians object to the Muslim holidays and, perhaps because of the controversy, President Joaquim Chissano has delayed signing the Bill into law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We oppose these holidays because if the Muslims succeed at this they will impose other laws,&quot; the Catholic Cardinal Dom Alexandre dos Santos says.  &quot;Tomorrow we could find that fundamentalism has taken over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dos Santos and the Christian Council have urged Chissano not to enact the Eid holiday Bill. They suggest a &quot;tolerencia de ponto&quot; which would allow Muslims to take the days as holiday. Muslims say workplaces and schools would not honour the informal holiday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In its Marxist zeal after coming to power in 1975, the Frelimo government made Christmas a non- religious holiday called Family Day.  Christians charge that they do not have any public holidays, but Muslims counter that every Sunday is a Christian holiday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mozambique seems a long way from the centres of Islam. More than 800 years ago Arab traders brought the faith to trading posts along the country's Indian Ocean coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Portuguese colonialists imposed Catholicism 300 years later and forced Muslims to take Christian names. But the Muslim faith has remained strong, particularly in the north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a 1991 government survey, Muslims make up about 20% of the 17-million population, while Catholics account for 24%, Protestants 21% and 30% follow traditional practices of ancestral worship. However, Muslim leaders claim their own numbers are much greater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Muslims are 40 to 50% of the population,&quot; Nazir Lunat, a businessman and Frelimo member of parliament, says. &quot;We were suppressed in the colonial time and during Frelimo's Marxist years. We could not stand up and be counted openly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lunat is overseeing the construction of a mosque in Maputo's wealthy Polana district, joining 22 other mosques in the capital. Some observers say Arab states are funding the proliferation of mosques across the country, a claim Lunat denies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mozambique's main opposition group, Renamo, is firmly against the Eid holidays. &quot;It is clear in our constitution that we have a lay state, which is not for any religion,&quot; Raul Domingos, Renamo's leader in parliament, says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The Inkatha Freedom Party is planning to oust some of its top political representatives following its election defeat in KwaZulu-Natal's main cities, the province's economic heartland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Party members will also debate whether to form an alliance with either the National Party or the African National Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IFP leaders said the party was expected to do a major overhaul of its parliamentary lists. Some of its provincial deadwood will probably be forced to quit, making way for national heavyweights to bolster its forces in the KwaZulu-Natal legislature.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National Arts and Culture Minister Ben Ngubane has been mentioned as one leader whose talents may be recruited to help the party shore up its provincial image in advance of the 1999 national elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seen as a long-term successor to IFP national chairman Frank Mdlalose as premier, Ngubane has also been tipped as a possible successor to party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IFP secretary general Ziba Jiyane said a National Council meeting would begin a process of &quot;intensive introspection and thorough self-criticism from which we can only emerge with a broader appeal&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Debates over the party's future in the Government of National Unity appeared to have been placed on the back-burner in favour of this reassessment, with Jiyane this week reducing last week's &quot;strong possibility&quot; of a withdrawal to a &quot;50-50&quot; chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jiyane said the party would &quot;leave no stone unturned&quot; in its appraisal of the election results, and the process would stretch well beyond the party's national conference due in three weeks and may include a series of workshops in which party leaders would examine the party's policies and direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IFP leaders said two views were being expressed within their ranks: one favoured building an alliance with the NP with the aim of fitting into its initiative to create a new political movement to challenge the ANC for national power in 1999, while others wanted an alliance with the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IFP leaders said if the National Council endorses Ngubane's return to the province, this would bolster the chances of an ANC-IFP alliance -- at least in KwaZulu-Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ngubane is known to have a healthy relationship with all ANC leaders, nationally and provincially.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mdlalose is believed to favour co-operation with the ANC at local government level -- an idea mooted by the ANC following its massive urban sweep last week. However the NP is trying to prevent the formation of such an alliance, fearing it could snowball into an ANC-IFP alliance at higher levels of the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is understood that the NP had already reached a tentative agreement with elements within the IFP to outvote the ANC for control of the Richard's Bay Transitional Local Council, which the ANC won, but failed to secure an overall majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, other elements within the IFP, which favoured easing grassroots tensions to place the focus on delivery, had formed a compact with the ANC to work together in the strife-torn Estcourt-Wembezi council, where the two parties were evenly matched and together outnumber the majority ratepayers association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jiyane said the party had instructed newly-elected councillors within its ranks to form &quot;tactical alliances&quot; based on local situations until the party decided which direction to take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Party leaders suggested the debate on local government alliances would need to be resolved by this weekend, in advance of the local horsetrading which would precede the first formal meetings of the new councils. The debate about the party's national future was likely to rage on for much longer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both the ANC and NP are testing the waters with the party at local government level. The ANC's offer of local government co-operation is seen as an extension of the recent peace initiative and, if extended to provincial and national levels, could herald the end of bloodshed and the beginning of an era in which South Africa's two leading black parties would move forward on the basis of delivering to a common constituency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jiyane did not rule out an ANC-IFP alliance, saying: &quot;In principle, I'm not against the possibility. Our constituencies are the same -- the poorest of the poor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other IFP leaders say such an alliance could also give the IFP an opportunity to extract constitutional concessions from the ANC, and soften ANC determination to destroy the IFP's powerbase in KwaZulu-Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other IFP leaders, however, appear more inclined to support an opposition alliance. The party's local government MEC Peter Miller argued that KwaZulu- Natal's electorate had delivered a &quot;two-thirds anti- ANC vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is a clear potential for realignment (with the NP and DP),&quot; he said. Dismissing the prospects of an alliance with the ANC, Miller said the ANC's co-operation offer was &quot;just big talk. In Maritzburg they control two-thirds of the council. Do you think they are going to be altruistic and form an alliance when their own councillors want positions?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Critics say Miller's suggestion of an IFP-NP alliance would merely herald a return to the segregated politics of the past, when the IFP ruled the province's black population through the KwaZulu homeland while the NP controlled the &quot;minority&quot; populations in white Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IFP leaders said the party would have to find a common ground between these opposing viewpoints before it take its place in South Africa's emerging political realignment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decisions it takes will be pivotal in determining whether the party can reverse the backslide it experienced last week or find itself relegated to history's scrapyard by the forces of urbanisation and development.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - On the second floor of a new office block at No 33 Hoof Street in Braamfontein four big video screens are watched by a clutch of dedicated smokers. Inside the smokeless but stuffy room next door the closed- circuit cameras play over the pensive faces of 11 wigless judges in gowns of cream-soda green.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is an unexceptional setting for a moment of high drama in legal and political history as the Constitutional Court this week became a political battlefield on which some of the country's most eminent lawyers fought to shape the new South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The court has set aside two weeks to hear whether the final constitution honours the fundamental principles of the interim constitution, thrashed out during the epic Kempton Park negotiations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lawyers acting for both politicians and various interest groups are arguing it is not and that the judges cannot approve the final constitution.  The certification process -- the first in South Africa's legal history -- is designed to guarantee that no political party, particularly minority ones, lost out during the political bartering over the final Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hanging over the judges is the realisation that even if they throw out just one clause, the entire constitution has to go back to the Constitutional Assembly where political parties will be able to claw at any clause they fancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shortly after the hearing began, deputy constitutional court president Ismail Mahomed told Jeremy Gauntlett, counsel for the Democratic Party, that even if the court sent back just one provision to the Constitutional Assembly, politicians could reconsider other clauses in the light of what he, Gauntlett, or any of the judges had said. &quot;That is too much to hope for,&quot; quipped Gauntlett.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first attack, which lasted two-and-half days, was launched by the DP, the Inkatha Freedom Party and the National Party against the new Constitution's handling of the powers given to the provinces -- an issue of crucial significance to political parties whose power is concentrated in particular provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the other side were the lawyers representing the Constitutional Assembly, George Bizos and Wim Trengove, advocates of a unitary state. They will be defending all the challenges to the final text.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The political battle was masked by what was mostly an abstruse analysis of the language of the interim Constitution compared with the final text.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gauntlett lead the charge against the sections of the new constitution which deal with the provision of powers to the provinces. He argued the new Constitution gave the provinces substantially less legislative, executive, financial and fiscal power than the interim Constitution provided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gauntlett opened by reminding the court that although his client, the DP, had some gripes it was aware the new Constitution was &quot;yet another miracle of the new South Africa&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was followed by the IFP's senior counsel Peter Hodes who said the final text robbed the provinces of a host of powers, including their ability to organise their own police force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tension between politics and law was apparent from the start.  Several of the judges expressed concern that the certification process could encourage them to trespass on the territory of the politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Are we not called upon to make political judgment on what the provincial powers should be ... my main problem is how do we approach what are fundamentally political questions?&quot; asked constitutional court president Arthur Chaskalson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Leave it to the politicians,&quot; Bizos shrugged; to which deputy constitutional court president Ismail Mahomed interjected: &quot;No. That's why we are here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bizos and Mahomed eventually agreed -- the court should defer to political choice in the final text, which was made in line with the fundamental principles of the interim constitution. Mahomed translated this into a metaphor which popped up again during the three-day argument over provincial powers. &quot;The constitutional principles are the lights of the runway through which you can fly your plane.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wrapping up the case for the Constitutional Assembly, Bizos said the description of the fundamental principles as a &quot;solemn pact&quot; had featured several times during the three day hearing as the court was told of the glories of provincial autonomy. &quot;But every solemn pact has at least two sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'It is significant that nothing has been said about the principles which recognise the need to promote national unity and legitimate provincial powers. After all, majorities also have certain rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trengove said that far from the provinces getting a raw deal from the new constitution, they in fact came out with more power with the establishment of the Council of Provinces. In particular, the new Constitution gave far more effective collective power to the provinces at the national level. He said the new text proposed a greater culture of &quot;intergovernmental comity&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He played with Gauntlett's conclusion that the text &quot;forced the lamb to lie down with the lion&quot;, saying: &quot;The benefits to the lion are debatable, but to the lamb are obvious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the hearing, several of the political midwives who delivered the Constitution -- Roelf Meyer, Valli Moosa and Cyril Ramaphosa -- flitted through the courtroom. The IFP's constitutional fighters, Walter Felgate and Home Affairs special advisor Mario Ambrosini (ardent advocates of provincial powers), were also there -- a niggling reminder for the judges of what Judge Laurie Ackermann termed their &quot;unique task&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the political temperature dropped when the African Christian Democratic Party took the stage to argue that the final text discriminates against Christianity. Sapa reported the party's KwaZulu- Natal chairman Kurt Worrall-Clare objected that the Constitution was the supreme law of the land and not biblical law. The ACDP had wanted the words &quot;In humble submission to Almighty God&quot; included in the preamble to the final Constitution, he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The media are in danger of becoming unwelcome guests in Parliament. Speaker Dr Frene Ginwala has ordered an inquiry into the justification for the R1-million paid out by taxpayers each year to accommodate journalists in its precincts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Attempts by the Mail &amp; Guardian to get a copy of the report on the investigation, carried out by secretary of Parliament Robin Douglas, have so far proved unsuccessful. Ginwala's spokesman Lawson Naidoo said the speaker had only a preliminary report and was awaiting a detailed memorandum from Douglas. She had undertaken to pass the memorandum on to the Press Gallery Association (PGA) after scrutinising it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PGA members were surprised to learn last month that the provision of free accommodation, subsidised meals and the media's role in Parliament as a whole were being examined by the Parliamentary Transformation Committee, set up to oversee parliament's restructuring. The PGA is not represented on the committee, although other stakeholders are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a meeting with PGA members last month, Ginwala said the committee did not view the media as part of Parliament, according to PGA chair Manas Tshungu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For the PGA the concerns that were raised were numerous, and central to these were the fact that such an important exercise was being undertaken without the media being notified. The PGA found it significant that the media were not seen as an integral structure of Parliament,&quot; Tshungu noted in a reportback on the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, she had said the exercise was not aimed at removing the media from parliament or making their continued presence untenable. The exercise involved a fresh look at parliamentary structures and procedures and affected MPs, workers and the media alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement issued on June 21, Ginwala said concerns that the press might be asked to vacate their offices in Parliament could have been prompted by a comment to this effect made during a meeting of the Senate Rules Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am assured by the President of the Senate that this was not even seen as a proposal and therefore does not even appear in the minutes,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I wish to reiterate my statement that any proposed changes in press arrangements will be discussed thoroughly with your members.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The PGA and Ginwala are expected to meet again once Parliament reconvenes in August.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Mountaineers question whether the South African Everest team ever really reached the summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A row is brewing over who owns the still-unpublised photos of the South African Everest team at the summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Everest expedition leader Ian Woodall says he is holding on to the photos of the South African team at the summit -- leading to speculation that the team never reached the highest point on earth, and setting the stage for a legal showdown with the Sunday Times and Out There magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a press conference this week, UCT sports scientist Professor Tim Noakes said until Woodall and fellow-climber Cathy O'Dowd produced pictures, they could not be considered to have reached the summit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is not an established fact there was a South African flag flying from the summit,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked whether the photos would eventually be published, Woodall joked &quot;we'll probably get round to it,&quot; but added, &quot;definitely not in a newspaper&quot;.  The Mail &amp; Guardian understands Woodall is negotiating with one or more book publishers, which may be offering a higher fee for previously unpublished photos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He laughed out loud at the suggestion that there were no photos of the team at the summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Woodall and O'Dowd maintain they own copyright on the pictures, a view supported by Kodak South Africa, which is engaged in processing the more than 15 000 frames taken during the expedition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Since the Sunday Times withdrew sponsorship, Woodall and O'Dowd own 100% copyright on the photos,&quot; said Kodak's sales and marketing manager Grant Bester.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Sunday Times editor Brian Pottinger said the paper believed it retained the right to publish the Everest photographs, despite withdrawing from the expedition after conflict with Woodall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There are contractual obligations on both sides. Although we withdrew from the expedition, our legal advice is that the essence of the contract remains,&quot; Pottinger said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though Pottinger said the Sunday Times was not contemplating any particular course of action against Woodall at the moment, he said the newspaper had been advised that &quot;if the photographs were published elsewhere, they (the Everest team) may well be in breach of contract&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monica Graaff, editor of Out There, said the magazine retains the rights to the first magazine publication of the photos. Although owned by Times Media Limited, the magazine did not pull out of the expedition when the Sunday Times did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pottinger added Kodak had not released pictures which the Sunday Times wanted: &quot;Kodak has made available to us certain pictures, but not the one we wanted to see which is the one of the climbers on the peak. There is still confusion in our minds as to whether that picture was shown by Woodall at the presentation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Woodall and O'Dowd presented a slide show at a Johannesburg hotel last Friday and charged R100 per person. The show prompted questions by the Sunday Times whether the photographs of the two at the summit were authentic or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bester laughed at Pottinger's accusations, saying the Sunday Times had never asked for photos since the paper severed ties with Woodall, with the sole exception of a photo of the climbers returning to Johannesburg International Airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Woodall and O'Dowd are adamant there is ample photographic evidence of their ascent of the summit, and refuted suggestions that the photos supposedly of the summit were not genuine. Bester also dismissed the allegations, saying he had seen digital camera images which clearly proved the team had reached the top.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Whoever says the photos were fabricated needs their head read.  Obviously they showed the less interesting photos at the slide show and the better ones will be published later.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked why only a few photos said to be taken at the summit were shown at the slide show, O'Dowd said: &quot;It's not about being on top. It's about getting there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But several South African mountaineers have expressed surprise that a photo of the team at the summit had not been made available soon after the expedition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Usually such a photograph is regarded as positive proof that the team reached the summit, and it is unusual for no such photo to have been published almost six weeks after the expedition reached the summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If you call yourself a national expedition, you have an obligation to the nation to prove you were there,&quot; remarked climber Duncan Elliott, who accompanied the Everest expedition to base camp to cover it for Out There magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Woodall has in turn accused Elliott of &quot;stealing&quot; photographs from the expedition and publishing them in Out There, an accusation flatly rejected by Elliott and by Graaff, who said the photos had been legitimately obtained from Kodak and from Apple, the computer company which digitised the images.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> O'Dowd was unconcerned about the lack of evidence of having reached the summit. &quot;We know what we did,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - &quot;During the apartheid era there was no channel for negotiation. Now that there is such a channel, students don't have to protest immediately, when something is wrong&quot; -- Benedict Radebe, 19, BSc first year</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A lot of the protesting isn't justified.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here at Wits, it hasn't been about genuine student grievances, but more about a power struggle between students and authorities. A lot of protesters are concerned with replacing top management at the university. (the protesting) is more racially polarised now than before 1990.&quot; -- James Hamilton, 26, member of staff and student</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I haven't really been affected by it. But education is where things happen, so you expect these kinds of results. Most students here want to study, and the group who is protesting is a small one. The issue of financial exclusion isn't valid -- everyone has to pay to come here, and it's hard for a lot of people to find jobs, but there's no way around it.&quot; -- Bridget Maddison, student</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The new government justifies protesting, but only if you protest the way they want you to.&quot; -- Joshua Mushi, 22, BA Hons</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think Mandela is trying to satisfy white South Africans.&quot; -- Sam Matsimela, 21, Mechanical Engineering 3rd year</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;During the eighties students could hope for very little, but now students feel that if they partake in protest action, it could have a bad influence on their careers. There is an individualistic approach now.  Students want to get on with their studies, get a degree, and join the commercial world. Student politics are on the decline, and from what I've seen, things won't change.&quot; -- Lawrence Khoza, 24, Hons Political Science</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - President Nelson Mandela's gentle but persistent finger-wagging at student organisations has met with reluctant nods in some quarters and outright rejection of the &quot;Madiba magic&quot; in others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But his moves have clearly signalled that the romantic liaison between the African National Congress and its campus foot soldiers is coming to an end. The ANC, as the governing party, now reacts to civil disobedience with veiled panic rather than warm applause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Student organisations, in growing confusion and disorganisation at having to fight a smaller foe in institutional managements and not &quot;the enemy state&quot;, have turned inward, choking on their anger at a government which, though supported by them, has yet to reward them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Worried about the potential flight of capital from our traumatised institutions of higher learning, Mandela has called students to order, warning that the destruction of property will be met with police action, while acknowledging with trademark diplomacy the seriousness of their problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he is not &quot;calling to order&quot; a disciplined mass of loyal students steeped in organisational politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today's students mobilise in swift protest around their own &quot;bread and butter&quot; issues of fees and exams but remain disorganised and dislocated from wider social goals. And their protest has turned uglier. The gentle banner-waving marches of multi-hued students have been replaced by uncoordinated action and campus trashing by black students, sometimes pitted against whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rest are a &quot;careerist&quot; bunch, as one student leader put it. Those who can afford to, get on with their studies without much regard for the community around them. Many of them, graduates of Model C schools are the &quot;Pepsi generation&quot; -- individualists at home in traditionally white institutions. And white students -- except the rightwingers -- have all but vanished from the political scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the first group is the thorn in the side of government and the ANC clearly perceives the danger in the growing distance between itself and those in the charging lines of today's messy form of student protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While they may be laughed off as the &quot;Azanian Fraternity&quot;, as some students refer to the increasingly vocal, if numerically small, Azanian Students Congress and Pan Africanist Student Organisation, the government is keenly aware that in the mass of disillusioned students these organisations may find a potential support base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC Youth League national president Malusi Gigaba alludes to this concern, saying his organisation &quot;has committed errors in not taking effective leadership of students to ensure that students demands don't get hijacked by people shouting high- sounding revolutionary slogans&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Steps are being taken, he says, &quot;to recreate the organic link between the ANC and the student movement&quot;. This won't be easy in today's climate where the student profile has radically changed. &quot;The large majority of them have not been involved in community struggle before,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the past, the struggles were also about bread- and-butter issues but there was a sense of connection with the broader community struggles. I hardly think the students are making this connection at the moment. If they did, they would know that to achieve their demands they have to struggle in a way that mobilises the sympathy of the public as a whole,&quot; says Gigaba, slating the campus trashing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We were part of the struggles against apartheid. But at no stage in our protest action did we vandalise those ivory towers. Violence did not become a substitute for struggle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Paso president Ignatius Molapo emerged from a meeting with Mandela this week unimpressed with &quot;Madiba magic&quot;. Students, he says, have been &quot;co-opted by the neo-liberal system of negotiation and dialogue&quot; but the government has not helped them develop the tools for this new terrain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are sick of being told things are in the pipeline. People are talking big, employing consultants, making money, but nothing has changed for the ordinary people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He cites the &quot;beginning of a phase of government clampdown on student activism&quot; and his response to the likelihood of more police activity on campus is fierce. &quot;We will fight the police. We have fought them many times.  This is not a new terrain for students,&quot; he says, adding that &quot;it is very difficult&quot; to stop students from trashing campuses when they don't feel a part of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It may be left to the radical left in Paso and Azasco to voice outright opposition to the government's &quot;failure to deliver higher education&quot; and Mandela's threat to bring police on campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Sasco, while aligned to the ANC, appears increasingly uncomfortable with its &quot;yes, Mr President&quot; role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And this is not surprising, since it risks losing support from an increasingly disaffected section of the population who is not in the mood to stand up and sing praise songs to the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We won't toe the government line. Our duty as the student movement is to be critical of the government, including a government we have elected. But we will continue to support social and political movements which voice the same concerns we have,&quot; says Sasco president David Makhuru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Sasco, the largest student organisation, is impatient at the perceived lack of support from government over its financial woes and fights with conservative university and technikon administrations. &quot;We've been fighting these battles on our own. The ministry has been standing far away from this,&quot; says Makhuru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He admits to problems in the student movement, but pleads for mercy. &quot;If we are to be judged as a weak student movement, we must be judged by different criteria.&quot; Today's times demand negotiation and leadership skills from students, not the rather easier skills of protest. &quot;In the past it was fine to shout slogans,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Does the chord of disharmony struck between government and student groups signal the start of a government clampdown on student protest and withering of student activism as has happened in many other African and Latin American countries after independence?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This might happen in South Africa,&quot; says Makhuru. &quot;But we are optimistic that the democratic movement is strong enough to resist it.&quot; Makhuru does not discount a future scenario where the &quot;imperatives of economic growth force the government to clamp down on labour and student movements.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Senior Department of Trade and Industry officials have come under fire from the European Union (EU) for refusing to endorse a ban on the movement of toxic waste to developing nations because South Africa can treat and recycle hazardous materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is despite repeated statements that the Cabinet is opposed to the international trade in industrial poisons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deputy Environment Minister Bantu Holomisa told the Mail &amp; Guardian he was shocked to hear Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) officials refused to endorse article 39 of the Lome Convention, which imposes a complete ban on trade in hazardous and radioactive waste between European countries and ACP (African, Caribbean and Pacific) nations, during a round of trade talks last month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A letter from Sabine Meyer, Green Party member of the European Parliament, addressed to local environmental organisations says the DTI negotiating team was &quot;unhelpful&quot; with efforts to control the toxic trade, and &quot;is refusing to go along with article 39 ... with the argument that it has the necessary facilities for the treatment of toxic waste&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The EU, adds the letter, &quot;is trying to convince the South African negotiators to at least accept no export to other ACP countries in the future. The commission imagines that South Africa might become the possible future main recipient of toxical (sic) waste from other African countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Environmental groups fear a powerful local business lobby that favours trade in the lucrative hazardous waste industry is now teaming up with officials in the DTI -- which falls under the control of the African National Congress's Alec Erwin -- who are showing increasing support for laissez-faire economic and trade policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said Chris Albertyn, co-ordinator of the Environmental Justice Networking Forum: &quot;We have just sat through a commission of inquiry that shows how the old government provided protection for Thor Chemicals, which brought masses of highly toxic material into this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Now it would appear officials in the new government are still prone to providing opportunities for the business lobby that wants to trade in hazardous materials, even though the government and the ANC are on record as saying they are opposed to all imports of hazardous wastes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The DTI failed to respond to repeated requests from the M&amp;G for clarity on its policy regarding trade in hazardous materials. Officials in the Erwin's office were also unable to answer the queries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - A bomb which former state president PW Botha described in July 1987 as a &quot;callous act committed by terrorists under the godless control of criminals&quot; was almost certainly the work of the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is revealed in a letter to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission from a lawyer inquiring about amnesty for his 22 policemen clients. Some of the incidents the letter lists as covered by indemnity include horrific acts of urban terror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And investigators presently unravelling the dirty tricks of the former government say there are many more acts of terrorism blamed on the African National Congress which were committed by the security forces, in particular by the police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;White South Africans are in for a terrible shock; they are going to have to rethink much of their recent history,&quot; one investigator said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Minutes after a massive explosion at the South African Defence Force command centre at Joubert Park on 30 July 1987 which injured 70 people, including five soldiers, the National Party government placed the blame on the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then-state president PW Botha was widely reported in the media hysterically condemning the bombing as a &quot;dastardly and callous act committed by terrorists under the control of godless criminals&quot;. Then minister of law and order Adriaan Vlok also immediately blamed the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Joubert Park bomb was placed in a truck and left a crater more than 2m in diameter after it exploded. Shock waves blew out windows in buildings four blocks away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It came at the time when Frederik van Zyl Slabbert was in Dakar, Senegal, meeting the ANC. Botha used the blast to appeal to all South Africans to &quot;stand together against these forces of evil and not to associate with them in any way whatsoever&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Advocate Jan Wagener wrote to the truth commission last week on behalf of 22 clients. He listed 18 incidents which would be dealt with in their amnesty applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The list includes the deaths of Piet Ntuli in KwaNdebele in 1986 and of lawyer Bheki Mlangeni in 1991. The disappearance of the three Port Elizabeth acitivists known as the &quot;Pebco three&quot; is also listed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other deaths in-clude Brian Nqulunga in 1990; Moses Nthelang at Vlakplaas in 1991; Japie Ma-ponya, an ANC member, at Mafikeng in 1985; nine ANC members in KwaNdebele in 1988; nine ANC members in Bophuthatswana in 1988; Joe Jele in 1986; a policeman and his wife at Hammanskraal in 1988; Jeffrey Sibiya in Boph-uthatswana in 1987; Harold Sefola; Andrew Makupe and Jackson Maake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The list also includes &quot;persons injured and killed during attacks on the homes of members of the South African Police due to faulty hand-grenades and a limpet mine&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Explosions at the ANC offices in London are included, as well as explosions in Bophuthatswana, Mamelodi, Atteridgeville and Pienaarsrivier in 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wagener says in his letter that indemnity was granted during 1994 to 3 500 members and ex-members of the police in terms of the Indemnity Act of 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Although this indemnity has been questioned by certain people, including the present minister of justice, we are of the view that it is legally sound and valid,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I will in due course provide you with full particulars in this regard and, if necessary, motivate the said validity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Should you, however, after considering all the facts, come to the conclusion that the indemnity referred to cannot be recognised by you, my clients who are affected thereby are prepared to apply anew for amnesty, provided that the same principles will apply in respect of members of the ANC and other parties who also obtained indemnity in terms of the same provision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wagener said incidents which, according to his instructions, were covered by the indemnity included the bombing of Khotso House (in August 1988), Khanya House, Cosatu House (December 1991), a community centre in Cape Town (1987), a counsellors' hall in Soweto, power substations in Sandton and Randburg, and damage caused to houses of ANC members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Truth commission spokesman John Allen said it was regrettable that the details of the letter emerged in the media before Wagener received a response from the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There has been a response since, but we are not releasing its details to the media,&quot; Allen said. &quot;People should be able to apply for amnesty as individuals. Forms are available and they are welcome to fill them in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said the information in Wagener's letter was &quot;nothing new. We think there is much more than meets the eye, there is more that should still be disclosed by the police.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mamoepa added that the disclosures vindicated the ANC's submissions to the truth commission and testimony from witnesses already presented to the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC is sceptical about whether the disclosures will change the impressions of many people who firmly believed during the 1980s that it was responsible for every activity the government blamed on the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There will always be people who believe we were responsible for every necklace murder and every bomb blast in which civilians were injured,&quot; said Mpumalanga Premier Matthew Phosa, who was the ANC's secretary of intelligence between 1990 and 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Those people are in for a surprise. I wouldn't be surprised if former government agents took responsibility for even more incidents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Phosa slammed the media as well for allowing itself to be manipulated by the government in its reporting during the 1980s. &quot;The truth is finally catching up with them,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - A crisis of confidence has hit the South African justice system with threats of unprecedented strike action in the prosecution service, glaring inconsistencies in sentencing and bail and major controversy over the premature release of criminals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most serious aspect of the crisis is the threatened collapse of the prosecution service which is being strangled by civil-service red tape -- preventing the Justice Department from creating new posts and paying senior staff adequate salaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senior prosecutors are resigning at an alarming rate. According to the Society of State Advocates, six deputy attorneys general and three senior state advocates have applied for severance packages in the Pretoria office alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Cape Town, the attorney general's office is set to lose three senior state advocates, and the Office for Serious Economic Offences another three, while in the Witwatersrand three senior public prosectors have submitted their resignations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Discontent in the service has been fuelled by resentment at recent salary increases which have put magistrates way ahead of prosecutors, regardless of seniority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government was able to boost magistrates' salaries because they are independent of the civil service. Prosecution staff up to the level of deputy attorney general are treated as civil servants and subject to the control of the Public Service Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> White senior prosecutors are taking generous retirement packages -- those with 30 years' experience, for example, can leave with over R1- million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Confidence in the justice system is also being undermined by what are seen as glaring inconsistencies in sentencing policy and the granting of bail to potentially dangerous accused and convicted killers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A striking example recently was the case of Gideon Niewoudt, the security branch officer convicted of the Motherwell bombing in which three policemen and an informer were killed. Niewoudt was sentenced to 20 years. By contrast the young men convicted of the Lusiki rape of British and New Zealand tourists -- a horrendous crime, but one which involved no loss of life -- got between 17 and 23 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Resentment at the Niewoudt case was compounded by the fact that the security branch officer was released on R50 000 bail pending appeal, despite the fact that he was a convicted murderer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Niewoudt case follows a string of instances where potentially dangerous criminals have been released on bail pending trial -- on the grounds they are &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; -- despite the threat they pose to the lives of victims and witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The perception that the state is being &quot;soft&quot; and less than even-handed in dealing with criminals also came into focus this week with the relase of Greg Blank, after serving less than two years of an eight-year sentence, and Abdul Bhamjee who served less than five years of a 14-year sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Minister of Justice Dullah Omar conceded the existence of a crisis in the system this week. &quot;We inherited a system in crisis and we are dealing with it,&quot; he told the Mail &amp; Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Omar was speaking hours after an urgent meeting on the subject with minister of safety and security Sydney Mafumadi, correctional services minister Sipo Mzimela, minister of defence Joe Modise and deputy Minister of Intelligence Joe Nhlanhla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Predicting that the salary problems in the prosecution service would be dealt with &quot;within a year or so&quot;, Omar warned prosecutors that they would have to &quot;take the consequences&quot; if they went on strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He would ask cabinet to approve the delinking of state prosecutors from the public service which would free him to act on salary grievances. Salaries set by the Public Service Commission (PSC) were &quot;too low&quot;. minister of Public Administration Zola Swkeyiya was trying to address this through &quot;rightsizing&quot; the public service but &quot;it takes time and we can't wait&quot;, Omar said.  &quot;Professionals are not being remunerated as such and this needs to be addressed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Omar said he was seriously concerned about the flight of senior skilled prosecutors. His path to redressing the situation was blocked by the constitutional court challenge to the new constitution by attorneys general who were opposed to the proposed national directorate of public prosecutions on grounds that it would interfere with their independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Once the constititutional court challenge has been decided and I know where I stand, I will proceed with legislation and argue my case with the support of parliament,&quot; Omar said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Delinking is the way forward and by saying so (state prosecutors and advocates) will help me. I fully sympathise with their plight.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said he had tried to get approval for the move but it had been opposed: it had been easier to argue successfully for the delinking of magistrates and the judiciary on grounds of judicial independence, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Omar is likely also to appeal to cabinet to make more money available for the criminal justice system. The PSC had approved 50 senior prosecutor posts but the treasury had refused the funds, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he was confident salary problems would be dealt with. Omar said cabinet this week approved a series of bills he'd brought, including one providing for a major crackdown on corruption within the justice system itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead of the commission President Nelson Mandela said he would appoint to investigate corruption -- including that which took place under the National Party -- it had been decided to legislate, to give the probe real teeth, Omar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Next to a bill that would streamline criminal procedure and make courts more efficient the Institution of Special Investigation Units and Special Tribunals bill was the most crucial of those approved, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tribunal's first focus would be on rooting out corruption in the courts and police force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Omar said he was transforming the court management system so that the country's 540 magistrates' courts were managed in clusters of 40 to 50 rather than from Pretoria. Chief and senior magistrates would form management teams responsible for staffing, training and ensuring better co-operation between the courts, communities and the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He conceded that newly appointed prosecutors lacked experience and said planning for a national training programme funded by the Canadian government was in its final stages. &quot;I am trying to develop national solutions that would impact on every court in the country,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He rejected charges that affirmative action appointments were seeing people promoted beyond their capacity, resulting in inexperienced prosecutors appearing against seasoned lawyers and losing cases they should not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have appointed a number of blacks but they are as competent and as incompetent as whites,&quot; Omar said. &quot;I do not think people have been promoted above their competence but bringing 11 departments together and addressing discrepancies does take its toll and has created a strain on the system as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Delinking prosecutors and advocates is central to resolving the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said ministers at Wednesday's meeting discussed the role of national intelligence in cracking down on crime syndicates involved in drug trafficking, gun-running, car hijackings and money laundering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deputy minister of Intelligence Joe Nhlanhla had tabled the national crime prevention strategy at a meeting with his counterparts from Southern African Development Community countries with a view to building a common approach, Omar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other new bills approved by cabinet included several allowing for greater international co-operation in tackling crime and making extradition easier. The Proceeds of Crime Bill would allow for property and other illicit gains to be confiscated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liaison between his ministry and those of safety and security and correctional services was tight, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The ministers are working very closely together, there's a realisation we can't pass the buck. We have all inherited problems and the financial constraints hit us all equally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It had been decided they would work on a joint budget for the next financial year, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The national crime strategy is not just a piece of paper,&quot; Omar said.  &quot;We are putting in place measures which never existed before. &quot;You don't see many tangible results immediately but many things are happening at different levels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New legislation was part of a comprehensive assault against crime, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The priority is effective action against corruption within the criminal justice system itself, which is undermining the whole process.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London - A $4,5-billion poker game between diamond trader De Beers and the world's biggest diamond mine, Argyle, will come to a head during the next seven months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Argyle of Australia -- part-owned by Britain's RTZ mining conglomerate -- walked out of De Beers' marketing cartel this month, a move some saw as the beginning of the end of De Beers' control of the $4,5-billion international diamond market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Argyle is gambling that demand for its own high-volume, low-value stones will pick up, particularly in emerging markets such as India, China and the former Soviet Union.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has just seven months before it has to decide whether or not to ask investors for $1-billion or more to transform its open-cast operations into an underground drilling operation. Should its break-out from De Beers' Central Selling Organisation (CSO) lead to further depression in the price of low-grade diamonds, Argyle may be forced to return to the fold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But success for Argyle's go-it-alone strategy would clearly influence other big players to leave the CSO. In particular, BHP, the Australian multinational, is a key factor in the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has won permission from the Canadian environmental authorities to begin diamond operations in the Northwest Territories, which will require an investment of Can$1,2-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These operations are unlikely to bear fruit before 2000, by which time success for Argyle may tempt BHP not to market its stones through the CSO but to join Argyle in selling its stones on the open market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The parting between Argyle and De Beers was triggered by the CSO's decision, in view of changing social patterns and growing inequality in the industrial world, to re-weight its pricing strategy, increasing the price of more expensive stones while lowering that of cheaper &quot;Indian goods&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Argyle, despite its record output, produced just 6% of CSO sales by value; half its stones are used for industrial purposes, the other half feature mainly in cheap types of jewellery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the surface, the CSO was unruffled when Argyle walked out. But it is thought De Beers believes its absence from the cartel sets an unfortunate precedent; it has seen defections before and is keen for Argyle to return to the CSO.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - West Coast diamond companies have had mixed fortunes in recent years, not least because of the dumping of low-quality diamonds on the world market by Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The agreement reached by De Beers' Central Selling Organisation (CSO) and Russia in February has since stabilised the situation, but some of the smaller producers are now setting their caps at the higher value end of the market to avoid future problems, while strengthening alternative selling techniques.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This week the Trans Hex Group said it aimed to increase annual diamond production to one million carats or $250-million a year within five years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The focus would be on &quot;alluvial and shallow marine operations, but opportunities to develop kimberlites and open-pittable gold deposits will be considered&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would concentrate on diamond projects that could produce &quot;diamonds in the higher price per carat range -- preferably in excess of $200 per carat&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was the first time the group quantified production targets and analysts said it indicated that Trans Hex was following the lead of De Beers in concentrating on higher priced quality gems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1994 and 1995, the world market was swamped by poorer quality diamonds. &quot;The shortage of true gem diamonds persists and the expected synchronised growth in the developed world in the second half of 1996 for the first time in years means there will be a persistent disequilibrium to the end of the century,&quot; said an analyst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trans Hex has set up a foreign arm, Trans Hex International Limited, in Canada to finance its non- South African exploration projects. It will be funded through the private placement of between Can$20-million and Can$24-million, with Trans Hex holding between 53% and 59% of the issued shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It aims to bring &quot;at least one of the existing exploration projects to a feasibility study stage within the next 12 to 15 months&quot;, Trans Hex said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The exploration projects are in the Central African Republic, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Brazil, Canada, Zaire and Angola. Trans Hex said it spent R26,8-million on the projects in the year to March 31 1996 and would spend R20,6-million this financial year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given the volatility of diamond prices, Trans Hex has introduced a tender-based marketing system, which it said was &quot;serving the group well&quot;, enabling it to sell even low-quality diamonds at &quot;satisfactory&quot; prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said the system was &quot;put to its sternest test in the latter part of 1995 when the group had to sell low-quality productions from Swaziland and Zimbabwe in a market where Indian goods were dead in the water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A greater number of tenderers than usual were invited and, in the event, a full complement of bids with most satisfactory winning prices were received. At the other extreme, during the virtual frenzy earlier this year for good quality sizes ... the biggest marketing problem was to limit the participation of South African tenders to a manageable number.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group said that if buoyant gem prices continued and the rand remained weak against the dollar, improved income and earnings per share could be expected in 1997/98.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CSO announced an increase in prices this week, with rough gem diamonds up an average 3%. Stones above one carat would cost 7% more, rising progressively according to size.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The White Paper on a National Strategy for the Development of Small Business in South Africa, endorsed in March 1995, is finally kicking into life. The national Small Business Act was tabled in cabinet this week, after extensive consultation, and the Enterprise Africa Conference, one of the more visible interventions, will take place this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The aim is to establish links between big business, the government and small businesses, concentrating on procurement. However, on the question of whether policy is finally being turned into action, the jury is still out.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The process of negotiation with the much criticised Small Business Development Corporation (SBDC), and the establishment of four new institutions -- to put right the older institutions' wrongs -- Khula Enterprise Finance Limited, Ntsika Enterprise Promotion Agency (Nepa), the Centre for Small Business Promotion (CSBP) and the National Small Business Council (NSBC) -- have been plagued by the natural organisational nightmares inherent in the transfer of funds, the division of competencies, and even the technical time-frame problems of employing and training staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Alistair Ruiters, head of the Centre for Small Business Promotion in the Department of Trade and Industry, set up to co-ordinate the national small business strategy, explains: &quot;We have tried to establish a long-term programme that will achieve a sustainable institutional framework for the next century. We have looked at best practice internationally and attempted to create a dispensation within which small business can become the backbone of economic growth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He argues that the government has taken a cautious approach to the issue. &quot;It is a very difficult sector, composed of widely divergent entities.  You have to be very specific about what you are trying to achieve, otherwise you can waste a lot of money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clearly the tension between effective strategic planning and actual delivery on the ground needs to be resolved. Septi Bukula of Upstart Business Strategies, a consultancy providing research and policy advice to provinces, and the Centre for Developing Business at Wits, elaborates: &quot;They have set themselves very ambitious targets, which may be an indication of their deep commitment to the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The massive publicity campaign around the new institutions may have promoted expectations that could not be fulfilled. He says: &quot;They announced targets but ran into serious institutional problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The financial wrangling that has slowed down Khula highlights two problems facing most of the government's institutional transformation process: rationalising inherited entities and dealing with complex bureaucratic financial arrangements. Khula is responsible for promoting small and medium enterprises' access to finance and administering the National Credit Guarantee Scheme, while providing financial and capacity-building support for non- governmental organisations, provincial development corporations and banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A lot of thinking and negotiating with financial institutions has been packed into the past 12 months to ensure that a credible and accountable service can be provided,&quot; claims Ruiters. More importantly, the relationship with the old SBDC had to be renegotiated. The culmination of this process will take place on July 16, when the government's share in the SBDC is cut to only 30%. The transfer will boil down to R599,8-million over the next five years, with the state holding 51% of Khula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ruiters is adamant that Khula will soon be ready to roll. The company said it will probably take 60 days, while Bukula points out the bureaucratic hitches that could hamper the process: &quot;The government's share is held in trust by the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC). So the SBDC will release the funds to the IDC, which will then pay back the treasury, which will then transfer the money to Khula. The cycle will be completed many months hence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is also not sure whether the private sector will indeed invest the other 49% in Khula. Ruiters explains that 16 financial institutions have been approached and Khula is almost ready to become a fully-fledged retail lender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite delays, the new institutions are definitely attempting to address the inherent problems of the SBDC. The confused desire to be all things to all people by providing both financing and support resulted in poor delivery, especially to the black community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The problem appears to be co-ordination. Bukula cites a case where a Nepa initiative was opened in Cape Town. Because of conflicts of interest with the national programme, it had to be closed down and moved to Pretoria, after it had in fact begun to deliver in the area, thus leaving a vacuum.  Says Bukula: &quot;One is not unduly pessimistic; when you are establishing completely new institutions you will run into problems, and learn from mistakes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, says Ruiters: &quot;When people talk about delivery, they must realise it is not just up to government, but about the people and government working together to deliver the programmes they need. We have the basic elements of success, a vision; institutional capacity. We now need to ensure that we work with the community. It is certainly not about just throwing money at the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The direction of macro-economics policy reflects the political agenda being pursued by the government. So the government's belated unveiling of its macro- economic plan is indeed a defining moment. However, judging by the cheers and &quot;hallellujahs&quot; of business, it seems safe to assume that the government's plan has strayed too far across the fence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the government is under immense pressure. Foreign capital (and undiluted domestic power blocs) are putting pressure on it to follow conservative macro-economic policies as a precondition for new investment.  The failure of current conservative macro-economic policies means less economic growth in 1996/97 -- and less government revenue and a higher interest bill -- squeezing the fiscus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Furthermore, the failure of delivery policies seems to have frustrated the government into at least offering reasons for the failure. &quot;Slow&quot; consultative processes are a suitable target, even if the government is the one late with a plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The macro-economic plan is based on the assumption that a market-driven, state-assisted growth strategy is suitable for South Africa. The counter-argument for a stronger government role through expansionary policies is summarily dismissed in one paragraph stating the deficit must be reduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, while the overall stategy is likely to be revisited through negotiation of some form, there are two points worth exploring here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How serious is the debt &quot;problem&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government debt, most of it interest-bearing, stands at R287-billion, 55% of gross domestic product (GDP). The interest payments on this debt are essentially the cause of the budget deficit (government expenditure exceeding revenue). This deficit is now 5% of GDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First, and mostly because of sanctions, government's debt is not high by international standards. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average debt-to-GDP ratio is 72%, for example. However, real interest rates in South Africa are 15% (against 4% in the OECD), making debt expensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Second, deficits are neither inherently good nor bad. The difference is the ability to direct the expenditure to ensure higher future returns so that you can repay the debt. Directing expenditure means putting it mostly into capital goods and not consumption. At the moment, government capital expenditure is low -- about 8% of the budget, and much of that in &quot;fixing thatched roofs&quot;. Therefore the government probably does need to redirect its spending before it can increase the deficit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Third, if a quick deficit increase can be dangerous, a deficit reduction could be worse. Deficits, calculated as a percentage of GDP, tend to be counter-cyclical. They increase when the economy slows down but decrease when it grows. Therefore, the best way to reduce the deficit may be to increase GDP. Accordingly, in an economy with excess capacity (manufacturing capacity utilisation is around 80%) such as South Africa, the fiscally prudent policy is to target the growth rate, not the deficit itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This policy is suggested in the International Labour Organisation report on South Africa. Also Malaysia (a &quot;tiger&quot;) disregarded International Monetary Fund advice and ran a deficit of over 20% -- with good results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Predictably, the business community claims that privatisation proceeds can be used to pay off debt. However, privatisation of even most state assets will not dent the national debt, nor the R30-billion annual interest payment.  In fact, assets of most of the largest parastatals (including Transnet and Eskom), once you have subtracted their debts, are not much more than one year's interest payments. Moreover, most of the larger parastatals are showing positive net incomes. In sum, privatising to cut the debt is a poor idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A better example of unnecessary debt is the government employees pension fund -- and its mythical &quot;fully-fundedness&quot;. Research has shown that changes to the way the massive R120-billion government pension arrangement is funded can make a big difference both to government debt and the deficit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In short, there are two ways to fund public servant pensions -- and the government is using the wrong one. Fully-funded (pre-funded) systems are usually used by private firms, where a separate fund full of assets guarantees workers' pensions even if the firm is liquidated. Governments, which theoretically cannot be liquidated, usually have pay-as-you-go systems (where pensions are paid out of general revenue). While most countries use a pay-as-you-go system to pay their public servants, South Africa uses an expensive fully-funded plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from being out of step internationally, the South African government has been filling its 'fully-funded' system with R70-billion of interest- bearing government stocks (basically government promises to pay) -- making up a large part of the national debt and deficit. Importantly, the difference for the government between promising to pay pensions out of its annual budget (pay-as-you- go) or a fund full of promises to pay (the 'fully- funded system) is huge -- amounting to an extra R14-billion every year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That is what the government paid last year as interest (R8-billion) on unnecesssary bonds in its pension fund and its normal contributions as employer (R6-billion). Most of this R14-billion (roughly the value of Telkom) is what the government could put aside each year for infrastructural spending if it just changes its funding arrangement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, it makes no difference to future taxpayers whether an obligation to pay pensions is thrust on them through redeemable government bonds in a trust fund -- or an unfunded contractual promise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To confirm this fact, the Smith Committee, appointed by the Minister of Finance to examine pension provision, concluded that &quot;South Africa's budget deficit before borrowing would have been much smaller had our civil service pension funds been managed on a pay-as-you-go basis -- as the majority of our overseas counterparts seem to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the table shows, changing to a pay-as-you-go system will halve the deficit -- even without resorting to desperate measures such as privatisation or social spending cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, standing in the way of a pay-as-you-go systems are conservative public servant unions, which are reluctant to give up their influence over the present indebted fund. As for their members, a separate fund (even an indebted one) is psychologically more comforting than being paid out of an African National Congress budget. No doubt, these are difficult issues for the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the government is likely to find changing the pension fund much easier, and more justifiable, than privatisation or cutbacks in social spending. Moreover, in the former option, the government is likely to have the support of progressive public servant unions. And even a small fraction of the billions in annual pension savings could be translated into better pay and conditions, winning the support of most concerned public servants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In sum, amid all the noise about cutting the deficit, it seems to have been overlooked that privatising and cutting social spending are not the only options. Using the pension fund as an example, there are clearly some ways to accommodate an increased role for the government even within a tight fiscal framework. &quot;Flexibility&quot; needs to be extended to fiscal policy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Mpho Mokwana, equal opportunities director at the Ministry of Labour, has strongly defended the right of the government to propose strict penalties and fines against companies that will not comply with affirmative action laws, despite recommendations by the recent Labour Market Commission report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We cannot have laws for the sake of having them, without being able to enforce them. In fact, even the commission calls for a process of auditing progress on affirmative action plans -- which is a form of enforcement,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This follows Labour Minister Tito Mboweni's announcement of far-reaching proposals in the Green Paper on employment equity this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mokwana said: &quot;What we envisage is a fine balance between forms of sanctions and incentives to encourage the advancement of employment equity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission, appointed last year by Mboweni to draw up recommendations on the restructuring of the labour market, proposed that &quot;legislation should not be overly prescriptive or punitive&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission said public accountability should be a major instrument for encouraging progress on affirmative action. Companies should be required to publish accounts of this progress in their annual reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Proposals for action that may be taken include withholding government business when tenders and contracts are awarded, as well as barring non- compliant companies from obtaining planned training subsidies or tax incentives from the Department of Trade and Industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mokwana added that the Green Paper does not in any way propose drawing up &quot;draconian&quot; laws to coerce anyone. &quot;That is why, for instance, we are not looking at suggestions of quotas for how many people should be employed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This does not mean we will create legislation that does not have any teeth and will exist on paper only.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He emphasised that the thrust of the Labour Department strategy is to bring the various parties together to agree on what needs to be done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, he conceded that concerns about the possible lack of capacity by the government to monitor the effective implementation of the laws are valid. &quot;We envisage an incremental approach to the implementation of the laws. It will be the first time that we shall have to implement statutes of this magnitude and complexity and there are no readily available benchmarks to work from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What we hope to do is to bring about a situation where the various parties will become empowered to play the monitoring role, while the government gives the overall direction and guidance,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mokwana did not elaborate on who these monitors are likely to be. The Green Paper itself only refers to &quot;private organisations&quot; that would fulfil this function with the Directorate of Equal Opportunities in the lead, assisted by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration and the Workplace Forums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Included in some of the provisions of the proposed legislation is the need for companies to draw up &quot;qualitative and not quantitative&quot; affirmative action plans running for a number of years in conjunction with Workplace Forums, where such bodies exist. The results of these plans are to be shown in companies' annual reports and the Labour Ministry will have the right to examine these at random.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Production at Rustenburg Platinum Mines has ground to a halt as the last shift of 7 000 workers went on strike this week. With 21 000 workers already dismissed, the mass sacking sets a record since the new government took over in April 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anglo American Platinum Corporation (Amplats) officials were working around the clock, together with local and central government officials, to resolve the impasse. To break the deadlock, North West Premier Popo Molefe sent public works MEC Zacharia Tolo and finance MEC Martin Kuscus to the mine to act as mediators.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Everyone is doing what they can,&quot; says Johan Adler of Amplats, &quot;but there is little hope at this stage, although we did see some doubts creeping in at the latest negotiations. Possibly there is a slow realisation that these demands just cannot be met.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The miners are demanding the payment of death benefit scheme premiums and benefits, a refund of PAYE (pay as you earn) deductions and unemployment insurance fund (UIF), pro-rata payment of &quot;long service&quot; money and payment of a Platinum bonus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), which did not support the strike, is now in the unusual position of being forced to negotiate with management in a bid to save its members' jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NUM general secretary Kgalema Motlanthe says the strike was &quot;instigated and orchestrated by a group of workers outside the union who have been bolstered by a previous victory over management&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This &quot;victory&quot; is a previous illegal strike in February, against union advice, where workers at Amplats demanded the payment of provident fund contributions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Workers challenged management and they (management) bent the rules and gave in to workers' demands. Provident funds can only be accessed in the case of old age and premature death, dismissal or retrenchments, but management at the time chose to give in to illegitimate demands,&quot; Motlanthe says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Motlanthe says the reason this latest strike was organised without the union is because organisers knew their demands were preposterous and would not be backed by the NUM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Labour analyst Gavin Brown agrees the demands are silly and could not be upheld by the NUM. However, he says the strike reflects the unions' problems in maintaining control over vast numbers of members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'The strike shows how easy it is for group coercion and regional power plays to overtake decisions and hijack situations that are not approved by head office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's unfortunate in this case that thousands of workers have been dismissed,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The union has attempted to convince its members to return to work, but has highlighted workers' fears of intimidation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Motlanthe says the group responsible for the strike used &quot;unsavoury methods&quot; to solicit support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amplats, the world's largest platinum producer, is giving the striking workers 48 hours preference before outside recruitment begins, but so far they have not taken up the offer. And with the last shift of 7 000 joining the illegal strike, up to 28 000 miners may have to be replaced. Already the cost of the strike in lost revenue is estimated at R70- million -- add the cost of training and Amplats faces a huge bill this financial year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The loss in production has helped boost the price of the white metal, from $391,40 an ounce to $392,50, but Amplats' share price has taken a knock, hitting a year's low of R27.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Boy Louw said it best. &quot;Looks for the scoreboards&quot; was his superbly unique and ungrammatical reply to criticism of how the Spingboks played. So it should be with the 43-18 scoreline from this week's test against Fiji at Loftus Versfeld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was not an inspired perfomance. But it was a winning one, stretching the unbeaten run by the world champions to 15 and shedding some real light on the realities the side face and the potential that lies in wait for Australia and New Zealand.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is difficult to carp about a match analysis which shows tries by Andre Joubert, Japie Mulder, Mark Andrews and the ecstatic moment when substitute Danie van Schalkwyk earned his debut cap and first score in the green and gold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Or with the sustained pressure in the last quarter which led to Namibian referee Johan Meuwesen awarding the Amabokoboko a penalty try.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the other side of the scoresheet were tries by stocky Fijan scrumhalf Jacob Rauline -- following some superb running off the play -- and the hulking figure of skipper Joeli Vaitayaki who exploited some instinctive jinking genius from sevens maestro Wiasale Severi to crash over in the 47th minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is, in short, no real cause for despondency despite some worrying factors for skipper Francois Pienaar and coach Andre Markgraaff. It is best perhaps to dispose of the downside before examining the good that came out of the victory in the first meeting between this country and the Fijians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Surely the biggest problem remains at flyhalf. Joel Stransky's formguide this season has been patchy at best and cost him his starting place in favour of Henry Honiball. Honiball, in contrast, has had a fine season at provincial level. Taking the step up to the high plateau of the international game is still a moot point with respect to the rock hard Underberg farmer his teamates call Lem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He had a hesitant first half against FIji. Under fire from the biggest adherents of the &quot;Big Hit&quot; theory of tackling in the business, Honiball consistently missed touch with the boot and had some finger trouble in distribution -- an aspect not helped by some indifferent early service from Joost van der Westhuizen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even more worrying was the sight of Hennie le Roux being stretchered off from yet another kamikaze Fijian tackle two minutes from time, his neck securely braced. Le Roux remains one of the best broken-field runners in the modern game and the ball fairly glitters through his hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Without the option of Le Roux in the No 10 jersey, Markgraaff's broad base of versatility -- a feature of his selection in many key areas -- becomes severely limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of equal concern must be the inability of the tight five to dominate from the start. And the lack of committed ball retention. This apparent lack of resolution is exactly the kind of wrinkle the All Blacks exploit to the full. One suspects that Balie Swart is close to recall at tighthead, where his mobility will be allowed to gel with the huge talents of Os du Randt on the other side of the engine room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Markgraaff must also have underlined the four balls the towering figure of Fijian lock Emori Katalau won off Andrews and Johan Ackermann in the lineout battles between the two second rows. That, simply put, is not good enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Niether was the lack of real intensity shown throughout truly representative of a Springbok side -- even against a team who came to play it hard and fast, as did the Fijians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All this points to the inescapable fact that there is, indeed, room for improvement. But surely no case for a collective national gnashing of teeth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joubert was supreme in his almost arrogant reading of play until a crashing collision in a chase for a kick-head with opposite number Felipe Rayasi and aEhamstring tweak forced him off and gave Van Schalkwyk his big moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So was James Small, who initiated the break and delivered the chip kick which led to Joubert's opening try by popping up on the opposite wing and making the decisive break down the touchline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gary Teichmann too adds a new dimension to South Africa's play from the back of the scrum and when Pienaar and Ruben Kruger switched open-side- blindside roles, the loose trio started to look like something. This is an experiment Markgraaff must persevere with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Teichmann has the ability to take the ball forward across the advantage line even in pressure situations and, once the flankers were switched, was not isolated as often as he had been in the early stages of the game. It is a dimension we will need in the Antipodes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is also the fact that the Springboks tackled superbly even if some leaden-footed cover let them down in the case of Raulini's try. There isstill some jersey-tugging in evidence but largely there was no cause for criticism in this department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have the makings of a good side here. And in Markgraaff -- a cerebral player in his own active days -- a man who clearly thinks about the game long and deep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As for victory No 16 against the Wallabies in Sydney on July 13, there can be no clear answer until the side is named for the first of the two away games in the Sanzar Series, but one would tend to feel that the Springboks will run them close.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And that they will not disappoint an expectant nation when they take on the All Blacks in Christchurch a week later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We looks, as Boy Louw used to say, with expectancy at the scoreboards.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - At the colourful and emotional send-off for the South African Olympic team last Sunday, the Olympic oath was read on behalf of the team by modern pentathlete Claud Cloete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While it is true that Cloete is only in the team courtesy of a wild card granted to athletes from developing countries to ensure universality at the Games, he is far from being an &quot;Olympic tourist&quot; like many of the team who went to Barcelona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are those who think Cloete is there merely to add a bit of colour to a largely white affair, but in truth he has a far better chance of doing well than many of the 87-strong squad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sport of modern pentathlon owes its existence to the founder of the modern Olympic Games, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, whose wish to introduce a sport which could determine the best all-round athlete was finally granted by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1911.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sport consists of shooting, fencing, swimming, riding and running and, for the first time in Atlanta, will follow the original intentions of De Coubertin, who wanted all the events to take place on the same day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prior to 1994 the events took place over five days. This, coupled with the inherent costs of competing in disciplines like shooting, fencing and horse riding which restrict participation in the sport to mainly military personnel, led to a growing feeling within the IOC that modern pentathlon no longer met the requirements of the modern sporting environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The difficulties of taking part in the sport are illustrated in South Africa by the fact that only about 15 people compete in modern pentathlon but that is still more than the number of female archers in South Africa, a sport which has three participants in Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Cloete has limited international experience and has been in the sport on and off for only four and a half years, he is indeed a remarkable talent. The only reason he booked his own passage to the Games was because he drew petulant horses in his Olympic qualifying competitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The riding is the one element in modern pentathlon where anything can happen, even to the top athletes. Everyone is aware of that,&quot; says Cloete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet fencing and shooting are crucial to a good overall score and these are Cloete's forte. In Seoul in April Cloete scored 4 685 points from his other four events and had he drawn a co-operative horse and had a reasonable round of 1 000 points he would have scored 5 685 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cloete still had another chance at the last of the three Olympic qualifying tournaments in Rome in May but again his equine companion left much to be desired. &quot;It was like a turbo-charged Ferrari,&quot; says Cloete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The horse threw him twice and he earned no points for the riding. Cloete is optimistic about Atlanta, though, and believes that the standard of horses will be higher and more consistent there, making it less of a lottery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Atlanta will be the 26-year-old Cloete's first Olympics, but he has competed at two world championships. He must have some idea of what to expect in the cauldron of Olympic competition after attending the Barcelona games as a member of Nocsa's development squad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Barcelona, there were 64 competitors but this time there are only 32 with qualification being tougher than ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only one of the Barcelona medallists made it -- Russia's bronze medallist Edouard Zenovka, who claimed the last qualifying place in Rome by just three points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That nobody dominates modern pentathlon shows how difficult it is to be consistent in all five disciplines on the day with the odds increased by the luck of the draw in the riding event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, says Cloete: &quot;Fencing is the most important part of the pentathlon and it is something I'm really looking forward to. You need to attack and be very aggressive in fencing and that's my trump card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shooting, too, is a strong point for Cloete: he won both these events at the Olympic qualifier in Seoul out of a field of 45.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cloete came into the sport after being spotted at a run-and-swim biathlon in Cape Town at the end of 1991 by Mark Wiley, now a National Party senator and president of the Western Cape Modern Pentathlon Association. This year, Cloete relocated to Pretoria to train full-time under Paul Hentschel, a fencing master at Tukkies University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;From his results in Seoul,&quot; says Hentschel, I would say his potential is as high as any competitor in the world right now. He has a definite advantage over many of his opponents because of his ability to explode. He can concentrate his power and let it all go at any chosen moment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Should Cloete time his explosions to perfection in Atlanta -- and if the gods overlooking proceedings from Mount Olympus send him a winged Pegasus rather than a turbo-charged &quot;Ferrari&quot; -- this wild card might exceed his wildest dreams on July 30.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The first and last time Sugarboy Malinga and Vincenzo Nardinello met it was all hugs, kisses and fun and games in foreign accents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fun'n'games, in fact, is one of the things this Italian enjoys most about the fight game, even when he is on the wrong side of a beating, as he was in London after being stopped in eight rounds by Nigel Benn in his maiden attempt at the WBC world super middleweight title last July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He laughed and clowned his way through that outing and after the post-fight press conference -- in which he blamed his demise on wearing the wrong soles on a slippery canvass -- he bounded up to Malinga, threw his arms around him, kissed both his cheeks, and then told him what to expect from the &quot;Dark Destroyer&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Heez-a-nuttin,&quot; Nardinello announced with a huge grin, presumably with no conception that a year later he and Malinga would be meeting in less amiable circumstances. &quot;He notta so strong. Heeza eezee to catcha. He don'ta even heeta that hard. You canna beeta him Shugah.&quot; And so on.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malinga, who has the best smile in the business, naturally agreed, and nine months later went out and did the business. To the astonishment of just about everyone in this game he had lifted the &quot;world&quot; title in his fourth attempt at the age of 36, by dishing out a sound thrashing to one of the biggest names in world boxing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new champion returned home with his blonde, Mullett-topped fanagalo-speaking manager-trainer, Nick Durant, to what passed as a hero's welcome, receiving the full treatment from Nelson Mandela and being featured in the self-proclaimed American &quot;Bible of Boxing&quot;, Ring magazine, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Until then Thulane had always seemed to be one of those fellows for whom destiny always had a way of obstructing talent and ambition. A bright pupil from a dirt-poor Ladysmith family, he had to abandon his ambitions to become a doctor when he was orphaned as a child , and instead gave up school to sell furniture, while developing his reputation as a formidable street fighter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He tried karate, switched to boxing and excelled, but as a professional he kept on getting robbed by the judges. Either that or he would &quot;choke&quot; on the big occasion. And nothing else seemed to go to plan either. When he finally built his own house in Ladysmith, it was promptly destroyed by a flood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This lapsed Presbyterian became a &quot;born again&quot; Christian, but, like Job, he still had a few tests to pass. He bought a new house in Benoni but was falling behind on the bond repayments. He had a wife and four children, aged between 10 and 17, to support, and the money wasn't coming in. His boxing career was drawing to a close, his alternative employment as a model wasn't delivering and that killer smile was developing a lugubrious edge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then his youngest son collapsed and nearly died after being operated on for a brain tumour and Sugarboy did not have the money to pay for his medication. So he prayed and prayed and thought he heard God telling him he would deliver Nigel Benn's head on a plate in the fifth round, or words to that effect, but instead found his own head on the canvass at that point.  This time, however, he rose and, with the greatest of ease, triumphed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A battered Benn tearfully announced his retirement, using the moment to propose to his woman, before changing his mind on the first score the next morning. On Saturday night in Manchester he challenges Ireland's Steve Collins for the low-rent WBO version of the world title, and the winner will face Malinga, provided Sugarboy gets the unpredictable Italian on the same bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since his first happy meeting with Malinga, Nardiello has regained his reputation as a legitimate fringe contender. After a couple of inside-the-distance wins, he took on Henry Wharton, the mandatory contender for Malinga's title, and astounded the Yorkshireman by knocking him down for the first time in his career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, in the sixth round, Wharton opened a severe cut above the eye (Nardinello says it was with a policeman's nod) and the fight was stopped, but it showed that the Italian was no patsy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is nearly six years younger than Sugarboy, but with a record of 28 wins (16 knockouts) in 33 bouts, including two world title shots and two spells as European champion, he is not lacking in top level experience . He is a southpaw with a decent but by no means devastating punch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like the Malinga of old, he thrives on clowning in the ring, and is sometimes short of ambition. But if he is &quot;up&quot; for this fight, as he was against Wharton in January, he could make it a difficult evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Malinga to cash in on his title, it is important that he puts on a convincing display, and of course, imperative that he wins. A title unification bout with the Benn-Collins winner would earn Sugarboy the kind of money that would allow him to retire to carry out his ambition to become a full-time preacher man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> My tentative prediction is that both Malinga and Collins will win on points.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Fruit production in Africa as in the rest of the world is mainly seasonal in nature. During periods of abundance large amounts of fresh farm produce in Africa is lost due to its perishable nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are a number of reasons for this regrettable state of affairs.  Firstly, peasant farmers are often ignorant about cheap food preservation techniques. Secondly, often times infrastructure such as rural access roads, is missing or inadequate so produce cannot reach the market in good time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, during periods of surplus, prices are significantly low so farmers see no real incentives to transport produce to the market. In the semi-arid Kitui, Mwingi districts of Eastern Kenya and Lamu district in the Coastal Province, women groups are keenly learning how to preserve their surplus fruit produce using solar dryers. This is a German Technical Corporation (GTZ), funded project under the &quot;Integration of Tree Crops Into Farming Systems&quot; (ITFSP) programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the recently concluded Africa Wide Food Processing Technology show held in Nairobi, Kenya from June 24 to 29, Beatrice Kingori of GTZ-ITFSP explained that there was a big scope for solar dried fruit in local markets in Africa. &quot;What is lacking is awareness. Our people need sensitization of the nutritional benefits of solar dried food items.&quot; She told APS that the food value of solar dried food items is only minimally affected by solar drying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On show were appetizing dried mango slices produced by the Matinyani Women Group of Kitui. The production process essentially involves cleaning, peeling and slicing of the mangoes. The sliced mangoes are then dipped into lemon juice made from locally grown lemons. The slices are thereafter spread on clean trays and inserted into a locally made solar dryer kiln for about seven hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dryer has a glass top surface of about 1.5 square metres and is rotated to follow the sun in the course of the day. There are three tiers of racks inside the dryer and there are inter-changed within the solar kiln device to ensure uniform drying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the day long drying process, the mango slices are sorted and packed in approved airtight plastic bags. The whole process is carried out in a hygienic environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Ms Kingori, each solar dryer unit can handle 10 to 15 kilogrammes of fresh fruit per day which reduces to 0.75 to 1.5 kilogrammes of dried fruit per day. This is a ration of 15 to one kilo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Ideally, the drying process should take place in a single day. If you leave it overnight there is likelihood of deterioration of quality,&quot; she explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dried fruit slices can be eaten in that form or reconstituted with water to make fruit juices. &quot;There is good nutritional preservation,&quot; asserted Ms. Kingori.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The glass topped dryer kiln is designed for long life at the cost of about $300. But it is possible to make a cheaper solar dryer though it will be less durable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, at a workshop conducted during the food processing exhibition, an Indian food processing expert urged Africans to emulate some of India's technology in the food sector for rapid development of the rural sector of the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Nutan Guha Biswas provided a number of examples where Indian technology can be copied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of these is the &quot;comminuted orange beverage base.&quot; The advantages of the &quot;comminuted orange beverage base&quot; consist in the utilization of all components of fruit except seeds, thus ensuring less wastage, better yield, better nutrition, better product quality from the point of view of colour, cloud and flavour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The process consists of selection of fruits, washing, steaming, cutting into pieces and blending with a calculated quantity of sugar syrup and passing through a strainer to get a homogenous product which is then bottled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Biswas also suggested the manufacture of low cost malted weaning food to combat protein calorie malnutrition which is prevalent in Africa. The process is easy to carry out even in rural areas. It adapts the melting or germination process and uses locally available cereals and legumes. A cereal like barley and a legume like green gram are malted and turned into powder form before blending in suitable proportions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The process, of weaning food production consists of selection, cleaning of barley, (or any suitable cereal like sorghum) and soaking. Similarly for green gram. After melting (germinating) the two items are separately dried, dehulled, roasted in a kiln and powdered then blended with other suitable ingredients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The equipment needed include dryers, huller, grinder, roaster, mixer, heat sealer and air blower. All these are available at village level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is important to point out that the melting process releases enzymes that turn the food into a highly nutritional form.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Fruit production in Africa as in the rest of the world is mainly seasonal in nature. During periods of abundance large amounts of fresh farm produce in Africa is lost due to its perishable nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are a number of reasons for this regrettable state of affairs.  Firstly, peasant farmers are often ignorant about cheap food preservation techniques. Secondly, often times infrastructure such as rural access roads, is missing or inadequate so produce cannot reach the market in good time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, during periods of surplus, prices are significantly low so farmers see no real incentives to transport produce to the market. In the semi-arid Kitui, Mwingi districts of Eastern Kenya and Lamu district in the Coastal Province, women groups are keenly learning how to preserve their surplus fruit produce using solar dryers. This is a German Technical Corporation (GTZ), funded project under the &quot;Integration of Tree Crops Into Farming Systems&quot; (ITFSP) programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the recently concluded Africa Wide Food Processing Technology show held in Nairobi, Kenya from June 24 to 29, Beatrice Kingori of GTZ-ITFSP explained that there was a big scope for solar dried fruit in local markets in Africa. &quot;What is lacking is awareness. Our people need sensitization of the nutritional benefits of solar dried food items.&quot; She told APS that the food value of solar dried food items is only minimally affected by solar drying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On show were appetizing dried mango slices produced by the Matinyani Women Group of Kitui. The production process essentially involves cleaning, peeling and slicing of the mangoes. The sliced mangoes are then dipped into lemon juice made from locally grown lemons. The slices are thereafter spread on clean trays and inserted into a locally made solar dryer kiln for about seven hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dryer has a glass top surface of about 1.5 square metres and is rotated to follow the sun in the course of the day. There are three tiers of racks inside the dryer and there are inter-changed within the solar kiln device to ensure uniform drying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the day long drying process, the mango slices are sorted and packed in approved airtight plastic bags. The whole process is carried out in a hygienic environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Ms Kingori, each solar dryer unit can handle 10 to 15 kilogrammes of fresh fruit per day which reduces to 0.75 to 1.5 kilogrammes of dried fruit per day. This is a ration of 15 to one kilo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Ideally, the drying process should take place in a single day. If you leave it overnight there is likelihood of deterioration of quality,&quot; she explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dried fruit slices can be eaten in that form or reconstituted with water to make fruit juices. &quot;There is good nutritional preservation,&quot; asserted Ms. Kingori.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The glass topped dryer kiln is designed for long life at the cost of about $300. But it is possible to make a cheaper solar dryer though it will be less durable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, at a workshop conducted during the food processing exhibition, an Indian food processing expert urged Africans to emulate some of India's technology in the food sector for rapid development of the rural sector of the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Nutan Guha Biswas provided a number of examples where Indian technology can be copied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of these is the &quot;comminuted orange beverage base.&quot; The advantages of the &quot;comminuted orange beverage base&quot; consist in the utilization of all components of fruit except seeds, thus ensuring less wastage, better yield, better nutrition, better product quality from the point of view of colour, cloud and flavour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The process consists of selection of fruits, washing, steaming, cutting into pieces and blending with a calculated quantity of sugar syrup and passing through a strainer to get a homogenous product which is then bottled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Biswas also suggested the manufacture of low cost malted weaning food to combat protein calorie malnutrition which is prevalent in Africa. The process is easy to carry out even in rural areas. It adapts the melting or germination process and uses locally available cereals and legumes. A cereal like barley and a legume like green gram are malted and turned into powder form before blending in suitable proportions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The process, of weaning food production consists of selection, cleaning of barley, (or any suitable cereal like sorghum) and soaking. Similarly for green gram. After melting (germinating) the two items are separately dried, dehulled, roasted in a kiln and powdered then blended with other suitable ingredients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The equipment needed include dryers, huller, grinder, roaster, mixer, heat sealer and air blower. All these are available at village level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is important to point out that the melting process releases enzymes that turn the food into a highly nutritional form.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Eagerly awaited in Angola is the outcome of the June 1 to July 30 process of integrating Jonas Savimbi's National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) military personnel into the Forcas Armadas de Angola (FAA), Angola's national army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the coming of peace, this southern African country will now have to contend with the challenges of vulnerability brought about by more than 20 years of civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ongoing integration process comes after the May 21 conclusion of negotiations between the Angolan government and UNITA on procedures of disbanding UNITA's military forces in a bid to achieve peace in Angola, reports Angola Peace Monitor, a publication of the Washington- based Africa Policy Information Centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With UNITA's cooperation, this southern African country of 10.6 million people locked in civil strife since 1975 when it gained independence from Portugal, may be on its way to peace with hope for recovery.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Visiting this war-torn country between March 5 and 15 this year, Ms Omega Bula, Southern Africa Area Secretary for Division of World Outreach (DWO) observed that the current situation is one of fear and poverty. Part of the United Church of Canada, the DWO has been working with churches in the southern African region since 1936.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bula noted the presence of many roadblocks, the fear of armed attacks, landmines as was evidenced by several big craters in the road, unprepared bridges and deserted rural area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The years of civil war, she says, have made the country change from &quot;one of the most advanced African countries in terms of economic infrastructure, agricultural production, diamond mining, and oil production - to one of the most impoverished populations and paralyzed economies, which has given birth to social crisis that defeats one's imagination in terms of both the long and short term effects on the people of Angola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this country with an inflation rate estimated at 4,000 per cent, the DWO secretary noted that employment potential in the southern part of the country is virtually nil as factories have been destroyed by war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As it is, Angola is now vulnerable due to a shortage of trained people, lack of resources leading to an asking mentality without realization of its full implications, a tendency to look outside for help rather than within where solutions and possibilities are within their capacity to articulate and call for action, a falling back on the &quot;hand-out culture&quot; and the absence of analysis in which the war is seen as the cause of all the hardship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Angola, the DWO has been working in partnership with churches and church organisations. They include the Evangelical Congregational Church of Angola (IECA) and Council of Christian Churches in Angola (CICA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, in the partnership, there is hardly any programme that demonstrates &quot;any efforts to address the systematic barriers and causes of poverty,&quot; laments Bula. All too often the country's problems are blamed on the war with this lack of analysis leading to only skin deep efforts in dealing with the problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IECA headquarters are in the bombed out city of Huambo in the west. It is out of Huambo and into Bailundo that government forces pushed Savimbi after his retreat there when he was forced out of the capital Luanda, on the north-western coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although fear of withdrawal of financial resources by their long term partners was evident among the people, they displayed a strong will to live in the midst of their difficult conditions. For them, sustaining the peace process is the biggest task at present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;How do you work with people who have experienced so much violence, structural violence and youth who think violence is a way of life. How do you work with minds that have registered so much mistrust for each other and the system? How can we bring out the inner feelings of the people so that they can be dealt with openly? How do we enable the two sides of the war to gain confidence in each other without compromising the church in one way or another?&quot; -- are questions that pose serious challenges according to Bula's report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A pastors' meeting in Huambo identified hunger for food and leadership training as two needs. However, of their various requirements, the most urgent was to learn English, what Bula saw as a way of reducing their isolation with the neighbouring English speaking countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To the questions posed, the pastors recognized evangelization as the appropriate response; &quot;The church needs to preach the gospel of love, reconciliation, pardon, forgiveness. People must choose life, not death...the church in Angola must unite, should never take sides politically... (it) must be the voice of the people, even .. risk to speak the truth to people with arms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IECA Department of Social Assistance (DASEP) founded in 1981 is assisting in resettlement of displaced persons and returnees. Shifting from relief work into long term development work is proving a challenge as it needs analysis of the context and understanding of the global economic systems. Assistance includes food, seeds, medicines, tools and clothing.  Currently, DASEP is involved in retrying of demobilized young soldiers and their reintegration into the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In both Huambo and Bailundo, women's work groups offer seminars in nutrition, health education, child care and home management. Lack of materials as well as lack of analysis of the root causes of the women's desperate state are a major obstacle for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The church, in addition, is faced with the challenge of reaching not only those youth who go to church but also others who do not as they all need jobs, skills, education and health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IECA, despite the many odds it is faced with, is pressing on to meet leadership development needs in the participating churches. It heavily supports financially and staffs Emmanuel Seminary which was established as a united seminary with the United Methodist and Reformed Church denominations.  It has remained open throughout the war. With only five full-time and three part-time teachers, they have to ask for overseas personnel to teach theology. Beddings and repair of physical buildings are much needed in the institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In order to cope, the partnership is looking into ways of developing leadership among the local people to enable them do their own work rather than sending them outside the country to study as some of them do not return to Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Institutional capacity building is needed to enable IECA to undergo the transition from war to peace building and from relief and emergency to long term development, says the DOW Southern Africa secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other areas of focus include linking with others in the southern African region who are grappling with similar issues, supporting ongoing discussions between DWO and IECA over the latter's increasing need for financial assistance and DWO's diminishing resources even with the awareness of the difficulty IECA is to face in the future in terms of self sustenance, as well as working together to identify alternative sources of financial support other than those in North America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Concerning women, the focus revolves around including them in decision making and leadership roles within the church and beyond the women's only groups.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Burundi appears to be heading towards political deadlock with East African regional leaders over coming deployment of an African military force to stabilise the war-torn central African nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Regional leaders see the military force as a peacekeeping force that would try to end the civil war which pits the minority Tutsi- dominated army against rebels from the Hutu majority, but Burundi's leaders maintain that they expect only &quot;cooperation&quot; and &quot;assistance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, extremists on both sides are warning that the arrival of foreign troops would spark a full-scale civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burundi's Hutu President and Tutsi Prime Minister joined up the previous week to make a reluctant appeal to a regional summit in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha to help contain the fighting, in which most of the casualties are villagers, acknowledging that they could not stop the violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The request by President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya and Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo created a firestorm at home, with accusations flying that they were traitors, and thereby forcing them to backtrack, insisting that the force must be under a Burundian command, and saying that Burundi will define its mandate and its missions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The backtracking has run directly counter to what delegates from five African countries said at a meeting of a technical commission in Arusha on July 1, that the force should be a peacekeeping one with an independent command.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The host of the meeting in Arusha, Tanzanian Foreign Minister, Jakaya Kikwete, said the proposed peacekeeping force would not be looking for a fight but would nonetheless mean business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We don't want the troops to go to Burundi and fight anybody. We would like the troops to go there and keep peace, but with the capability to deal with those who are going to break the peace,&quot; he stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kikwete refused to say which countries might send troops to Burundi and which might lead the force, but an official who took part in the meeting said on condition of anonymity that Tanzania, Uganda and Ethiopia might be willing to dispatch troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kikwete said that when the Organization of African Unity (OAU), meeting at a summit in Cameroon starting on July 8, and the United Nations had given their blessing to the operation, implementation of the projects could begin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regional peacekeeping force would have to allow a national dialogue in Burundi to take place in a calm atmosphere, Kikwete stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The delegations present at the July 1 Arusha meeting were from Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Ethiopia, with Kenya participating as an observer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission set up a panel of military experts to plan the details, with soldiers from Tanzania, Uganda and Ethiopia expected to provide the force's backbone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That panel met on July 2 under the chairmanship of Tanzania's army commander, and is expected to arrive in the Burundian capital Bujumbura by the July 6 to 7 weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting took place despite a request from the Burundi delegation for a delay because preliminary studies had not been completed in Bujumbura.  These studies are supposed to be delivered by July 3 to Burundi's national security council, its top security authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But observers saw the biggest problem in Burundi as being the defining of the mandate for the force. One that would be acceptable to the Tutsis, who make up only 14 per cent of the population but hold the levers of power, and the Hutus, who make up 85 per cent of the population, a definition some diplomats in the Burundian capital said would be an impossible task in view of the distrust and fear that pervades tiny Burundi, about the size of the Scottish highlands but with a population of 5.5 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ntibantunganya is widely believed to have long privately favoured the intervention of foreign troops as peacekeepers, but that is a position which must be nuanced in public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The real surprise at last week's summit was that the Prime Minister joined the President in appealing for foreign troops, but only as a result of strong pressure from the region -- and particularly from the United States and the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both have pledged not to provide any money for development until the situation is stabilised, though agreeing to contmnue emergency humanitarian aid for the tens of thousands of Burundians displaced by the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Money is the key, diplomats said, with Burundi's economy in tatters and the government fast running out of cash to pay soldiers and civil servants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But one diplomat said the concept of the foreign intervention was agreed to too hastily, and was so vague &quot;that there won't be any follow-up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He noted that the army remained ferociously opposed to any foreign intervention, and said its leaders were only emitting &quot;signs of goodwill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Tutsis in Burundi are opposed to Tanzanian participation in any force, and the Hutus are adamantly against the participation of Ungandans as a result of President Yoweri Museveni's support for the Tutsis in Rwanda during that neighbouring country's 1994 civil war, which left between 500,000 and one million people dead. The Hutus believe Ethiopian troops would also support the Burundian army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The presidential camp in Burundi envisages the force as one which would place itself between the army and the rebels, providing a calm atmosphere for a national debate on how to resolve the three-year- old crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But army spokesman Longin Minani declared that Burundi's soldiers would continue to fight the &quot;genocidal&quot; Hutu rebels, and would defeat them, even with the presence of foreign troops in the country, and suggested that the troops be deployed along the borders with Zaire and Tanzania to stop Hutu refugees in those countries making cross-border raids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Minani also said that Burundi's powerful Defence Ministry had also demanded that the technical commission meeting in Arusha hold its future meetings in Bujumbura, pointing out: &quot;They have to be in the field. That was foreseen, and it would be absurd for them to meet elsewhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Hutu extremists in PALIPEHUTU -- the Party for the Liberation of the Hutu People -- said they saw the force as &quot;coming to help the mono-ethnic Tutsi army, which is in trouble,&quot; while Mathias Hitimana, president of the Tutsi extremist Party for the Reconciliation of the People, declared on July 2 that the arrival of foreign troops would mark &quot;the real start of the civil war,&quot; with Tutsis forming guerrilla bands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The looming deadlock comes amid reports of continuing fighting in several parts of the country which has forced new movements of refugees and displaced persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to an announcement on July 2 by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), some 4,000 Burundians, most of them Hutus who said they had fled ethnic violence, have arrived in Zaire and Rwanda since the last weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UNHCR quoted the refugees, who came from the north-western Burundian region of Cibitoke, where three members of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and three Roman Catholic clergy were killed last month, as saying that their homes had been burnt and members of their families killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the incident, no humanitarian organisation has been working in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clashes between ethnic Hutus and Tutsis are continuing, according to witness reports from the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond, who said the agency was extremely concerned about the violence, added that 2,500 Burundians had arrived in Bugarama, south-western Rwanda, after failing to reach Zaire because the border is closed, while a further 1,900 arrived in Uvira, eastern Zaire, on July 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In total, there were an estimated 223,000 Burundians in neighbouring countries, most of whom are concentrated in Uvira and Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fighting began in Burundi two-and-a-half years ago following the assassination of its first Hutu President, Melchior Ndadaye, in a coup attempt by Tutsi soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tens of thousands of Burundians have since been killed in ethnic fighting which has now spread throughout the tiny country and become a civil war.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sao Tome - Sao Tome and Principe President Miguel Trovoada and a former Marxist ruler Manuel Pinto Da Costa finished neck-and-neck in the country's first elections held on June 30 and will face each other in a run-off on July 21, election officials announced on July 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trovoada defied pre-election opinion polls in this tiny and impoverished twin-island state off the coast of West Africa and finished first in the election with 40.85 per cent of the votes, the electoral commission said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He ended up slightly ahead of the 39.14 per cent for the favourite, former president Manuel Pinto Da Costa, who ruled from 1975, when the country won independence from Portugal, until 1991 at the head of a single-party Marxist-Leninist state.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The electorate totaled 52,000 out of a population of 120,000 people, a 65 per cent turnout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were a total of five candidates, including former premier Carlos Da Graca, running in a campaign dominated by growing unemployment, rising inflation and shortages of basic necessities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Graca had asked the commission to extend the poll to account for the delay, but many polling booths were unable to stay open beyond dusk anyway because of lack of lighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ahead of the runoff, all eyes will be on the third-place finisher, former Foreign Minister Alda Bandeira, one of the first women in Africa to run for president, to see which candidate she endorses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With 14.63 per cent of the votes, Bandeira was the candidate of the Democratic Convergence Party, the only group not represented in the coalition government in power since January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bandeira said after the first round results were announced that she was ready to negotiate with Trovoada and Da Costa, because &quot;in a democracy, one must be open.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The third candidate was journalist and anti-corruption campaigner Armindo Tomba. Last week's presidential election was the country's first featuring more than one candidate. When Trovoada was elected in 1991, his two rivals pulled out before election day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over the two-week campaign, observers had noted a fall-off in enthusiasm for the outgoing president amid economic problems and political uncertainty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fifteen foreign observers from France, Portugal, the United States and the Organization of African Unity (OAU) are monitoring the polls.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pietermaritzburg - The Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) remained the top political force in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province after local elections held there on June 26, but the ruling African National Congress (ANC) gained a major foothold in urban areas, final results showed on July 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Mongosuthu Buthelezi's IFP obtained 44.4 per cent of the total vote compared to 33 per cent for President Nelson Mandela's ANC, a report by the IFP-dominated KwaZulu provincial government said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the April 1994 general elections -- the previous electoral exercise in the violence-torn province -- the IFP obtained 50.3 per cent against the ANC's 32.2 per cent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The ANC has consolidated its support in KwaZulu-Natal cities, but the IFP overwhelmingly affirmed its strength in rural areas,&quot; election spokesman Warwick Dorning said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ex-president Frederick de Klerk's conservative National Party (NP) was third in the June 26 poll with 12.7 per cent of the vote, followed by the Liberal Democratic Party with 3.3 per cent, and the Indian-based Minority Front with 2.3 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Independent candidates took 2.9 per cent of the vote, with other smaller parties collecting less than 1 per cent each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IFP won a landslide in rural areas, with 393 regional councils compared to 113 for the ANC, the report showed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The situation was the opposite in the cities. The ANC was in the lead, winning 135 councils in Durban compared to 21 for the IFP, and another 252 in other urban areas of the province against 144 for the IFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both the ANC and IFP on July 2 claimed victory in the elections. IFP secretary-general Ziba Jiyane claimed his &quot;was still the clear majority party,&quot; despite winning less than 50 per cent of the votes cast. &quot;If some of the voting problems had been sorted out, we would have won 55 or even 60 per cent of the vote,&quot; he said, adding the IFP will legally contest the results in some areas of Durban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC spokesman Carl Niehaus said, meanwhile, that his party leaders were &quot;more than happy&quot; with winning &quot;important urban areas.&quot; &quot;We have done much better than we expected ourselves, when you take into consideration that there is still not complete freedom of political expression in some rural areas,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Niehaus noted that in addition to winning the cities, the ANC had improved its rural showing from five per cent in 1994 to 17 per cent on June 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nearly 20,000 people have been killed in 11 years of fighting between the two parties, including more than 300 people and nine election candidates since February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About 32,000 of the 1.5 million-odd voters who were registered in last week's poll will cast their votes later this year because of technical problems at several voting stations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Maurice Cardinal Otunga, the head of the Metropolitan Catholic Archdiocese of Nairobi, on July 3 consecrated Rev. Alfred Kipkoech Rotich the Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Nairobi in charge of the Military Vicariate, one month after Pope John Paul II appointed him (Rotich) to the position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his new position, Bishop Rotich, 39, will be responsible for the Military Vicariate, which according to the Catholic Church pastoral set-up is equivalent to a diocese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Covering all the armed forces, the Military Vicariate was established by the Vatican in January 1981.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing the congregation after the consecration, Cardinal Otunga told the new bishop: &quot;You have been incorporated into the college of bishops, the direct representatives of the 12 Disciples, who followed Jesus Christ.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cardinal Otunga also reminded the newly consecrated bishop that &quot;the function of the bishop is not one of honour; but to serve and not rule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The head of the Catholic Church in Kenya also reminded the congregation, which included the top brass of the military led by the Chief of General Staff Mohammud Mohamed, that as Christians, they &quot;should guard the Christian faith against interference from people driven by selfishness and personal ambition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And in his address, General Mohammud Mohamed said his office will give priority to religious issues. He also announced that plans were underway to put up a cathedral at the Eastleigh Air Base, where the July 3 consecration ceremony took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;History has shown that a religious soldier is more loyal, disciplined and diligent than a non-religious,&quot; General Mohamed said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new appointment of Rev. Rotich and his subsequent consecration as bishop comes in the wake of the appointment of Kenyan Catholic bishop for Nakuru Diocese, the Rt. Rev. Ndingi Mwana a' Nzeki as coadjutor (Assistant) Archbishop of the Nairobi Archdiocese. Pope John Paul II made the appointment on June 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A statement released by the Vatican Embassy here on Bishop Ndingi's appointment said in part; &quot;This gives Bishop Ndingi the right of succession if and when the incumbent Archbishop of Nairobi retires.&quot; Maurice Cardinal Otunga, the incumbent Archbishop of Nairobi assumed this position in 1973.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishop Ndingi, 65, who has been the head of the Nakuru Diocese for the last 25 years and whom the late Pope Paul VI consecrated bishop in 1969, has often rubbed shoulders with state authorities in the wrong way, due to his open criticism of matters touching on all forms of injustice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around Africa (Washington, DC) July 8, 1996 by the Africa Faith and Justice Network</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - On May 8th, 1996, the Republic of South Africa promulgated its first non-racial Constitution, thereby officially ending the transition from apartheid to universal democracy. The new document establishes the framework for a society which respects the rights of all individuals, regardless of age, race, or sex. However, the Constitution is not without its points of contention.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most importantly, the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), which controls the KwaZulu/Natal provincial legislature, has boycotted the Constitutional Assembly to protest the document's federal character. Led by Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha has consistently opposed a strong central government.  Despite the IFP boycott and repeated calls for international mediation, the Constitutional Assembly outlined specific powers reserved solely for the provinces, such as road-building and sports administration. Ultimately, the battle for federalism/confederalism will have to be fought in the nation's new Constitutional Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Additionally, several Afrikaner-based groups decried the new Constitution for its emphasis on universal standards of education. They feel that the Afrikaans language is an integral part of their ethnic identity and have been actively promoting the idea of single-language schools. Although these groups were unable to muster significant support for their proposal, the new document does not necessarily outlaw single-language schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lastly, the African National Congress (ANC), the party most responsible for the new Constitution, has been divided by a &quot;lock-out&quot; clause which would guarantee employers the right to lock out striking employees. While the ANC's traditional base of support in the labour unions has vehemently protested the clause, the party's more progressive wing has acknowledged that such a clause would improve South Africa's tarnished image as a country with labour problems. In an effort to block the inclusion of the clause, the labour unions staged a one-day, nation-wide strike on April 30th. However, the strike was poorly attended and an obscure reference to a labour relations code was unceremoniously inserted into the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All in all, South Africa's first non-racial Constitution remains purposefully vague on a number of divisive issues like regional powers, single-language schools, and employer's rights. The document's authors recognized the futility of trying to prepare for every possible situation that might arise. Instead, the constitutional negotiators concentrated on the new society they were building and unambiguously depicted the rights and prerogatives of the individuals therein.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - On April 26, 1996, the UN Security Council voted - 13 to 0 with Russia and China abstaining - to impose diplomatic sanctions against the Sudan. Sudan had passed the deadline for handing over three suspects in the attempted assassination of Egyptian President Mubarak; Sudan is allegedly harboring the suspects. The sanctions included reducing the number of Sudanese diplomats in a country, departure of terrorist groups with headquarters in Sudan and banning of international conferences in the Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sanctions were milder than the U.S., Britain and Ethiopia had hoped for. Egypt, who at first had pressed for harsher sanctions, backed down in the end, saying economic sanctions would make the Sudanese suffer and an arms embargo would endanger the unity of the Sudan. Egypt would not like to see an independent Southern Sudan controlling the waters of the Nile on which Egypt is so dependent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Security Council gave the Sudan two weeks to turn over the suspects.  After this the sanctions went into effect, to be reviewed in two months' time if the suspects are still not handed over. This will be early July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Russia and China abstained because they feel sanctions on the Sudan is one embargo too many. They, plus others, including Iran, and Syria, have stated they will not adhere to that part of he sanctions which asks governments to reduce the number of Sudanese diplomats in their country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sudan has said the sanctions are inconvenient but not crippling. It has also said it will screen foreign organizations based in the Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Civil War</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The war can no longer be called &quot;the war in the South.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has spread to the Nuba Mountains for some time now. And there are recent reports that the Sudan Allied Forces (SAF), one of the military wings of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), has launched attacks in the North, near the town of Kassala. The SAF is a splinter group of former Sudanese army troops who escaped Sudan after the '89 coup. 2. Several of the SPLA factions (headed by Riek Machar, Kerubino Kwanyin Bol,) have signed a &quot;political charter&quot; with Khartoum; it is supposed to be the initiation of a peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most analysts are not taking the charter seriously. It has been denounced by Garang as a &quot;sell-out&quot;. (Garang has been joined by another splinter faction, headed by John Luc.) surprisingly, the charter has gained support from Joseph Lagu, a former vice-president under Nimeiri, who had been living outside Sudan for the last three years. He still commands some support in the South, especially his home region of Equatoria. He has just returned to the Sudan. 3. The situation in the Nuba Mountains continues to worsen. It is not considered the &quot;South&quot; and is therefore not eligible for OLS (Operation Lifeline Sudan) relief. Reports of atrocities continue - villages burned and looted, people rounded up into &quot;peace camps&quot;which are more like concentration camps, land taken over by mechanized framing - but because very few people have access to the Nuba Mountains, hard evidence is difficult to come by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One issue which perhaps needs more emphasis and which affects the Nuba, the SPLA and the northern opposition is the question of land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For ordinary people in the South and the marginalised areas of the North, one of the main reasons why they are fighting is because of land.  People became fed up with government officials and merchants seizing their ancestral lands; they took up arms to defend what was rightfully theirs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even before the recent atrocities, there has been a history of land confiscation. And to make matters worse, the land is being confiscated by rich merchants who use mechanized farming. It is well documented that mechanical cultivation rapidly degrades the topsoil, making the land vulnerable to wind erosion. Commercial farmers (mostly NIF supporters) are given 25-year leases on the land; the farmers exploit the land ruthlessly so that after a few years the land is so degraded that it is unusable. This has happened already in the North.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government has been redistributing land to reward its followers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The issue of land, along with the issues of sharia law and self-determination, will have to be dealt with in any peace negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IMF Relations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In early May an IMF team spent a week in the Sudan. A report will be issued later on Sudan's economy in the period between January and April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Relations with the IMF have been difficult for a decade because of Sudan's failure to pay arrears which have now reached $1.7 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Relations took a turn for the better last year when Khartoum began to make a token payment of $4 million per month as a sign of good will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The talks ended without a debt arrears pact. The IMF is expected to discuss its relations with Sudan at a meeting in August.<BR> For more information, contact the Africa Faith and Justice Network, a group of people of faith working towards positive change for the peoples of Africa, at PO Box 29378, Washington DC 20017; telephone 202 832 3412; fax 202 832 9051; e-mail afjn@igc.apc.org.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - The situation in Zaire has become more critical and more complicated in the last few months. Fierce fighting has broken out in Masisi, one of the most fertile areas in Zaire. Living in the area were Rwandan Hutus (Zairean Hutus now), some of whom have been there since the 1900's, Rwandan Tutsis who fled the violence in the 1950's, Zairean Tutsis who were in Zaire when the border was finalized, and other Zairean groups such as the Hunde.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fighting in this area has broken out from time to time over the years.  It has worsened since the large influx of Hutu refugees in '94.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What appears to be happening is that the refugees have moved from the camps into Hutu villages in Masisi and are now joining with the Hutus in Zaire to drive out the minority Tutsis and establish a &quot;Hutuland&quot; in this rich agricultural land of northeastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports over the last two months say that at least 65,000 Tutsis have been displaced from their homes in Masisi; 11,000 have fled to Rwanda. Camps must now be opened in Rwanda because Zairean Tutsis are not entitled to repatriation. Many of the refugees are traumatized after days of terror. In one area 3000 Tutsis are trapped in two villages because of the fighting and a massacre is feared. At least 100 Tutsis have already been e movement of the displaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile border raids from the camps into Rwanda continue. The Zairean troops have arrested more than 50 of the ringleaders in the camps. But refugees are still not going back in large numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Events in Rwanda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inside Rwanda, the security situation has worsened in some areas. It seems the rebels have become bolder and the army more on the defensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both sides have been involved in attacks. Some of the incidents which have been reported in recent months:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - A woman was slaughtered; the evidence indicated that she was killed by genocide criminals who want to exterminate disturbing survivors and witnesses (25 such cases have been documented by African Rights).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Infiltrators attacked a military prison in an attempt to free inmates; there was a clash with the army; the army killed at least 19 men (April).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - An armed gang burnt the entire Karengera township and freed the prisoners from the local prison (May).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Rebels from Zaire raided local government offices and attacked three villages in Cyangugu region, killing at least 37 people. This was the worst attack since the end of the war in '94. Cyangugu fears civil war will start again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Shortly after the above attack, infiltrators attacked a jail near the border and killed more than 30 prisoners. It is unclear why the prisoners were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Progress of Rwanda's Tribunal/Justice System</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After two years, the Tribunal has indicted only eleven suspects. It is greatly hampered by lack of funds and by rivalry with the Rwandan Government who wants to try the suspects itself. One of the chief suspects, Theoneste Bagosora, who was arrested in Cameroon, is wanted also by the Belgian government for the slaying of ten Belgian peacekeepers. Since Cameroon has no extradition treaty with Rwanda, it has been a haven for genocide suspects.  There is some indication, however, that Bagosora will be sent to the Tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three suspects from Zambia are to be arraigned and transferred to Arusha, the seat of the Tribunal. They will be the first to go on trial. They include: Clement Kayishema, former governor of Kibuye who allegedly helped organize the slaughters in Kibuye where 90% of Tutsi residents were killed; George Anderson Rutaganda and Jean Paul Akaseyu, both charged with organizing and leading massacres in other areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whereas the Tribunal has too few suspects in custody, the Rwandan justice system has too many. There are now more than 70,000 suspects in Rwanda's grossly overcrowded jails. Some attempts have been made to ameliorate prison conditions. And the Rwandan government is preparing to begin some trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a surprise move, a U.S. court ordered a Rwandan suspected of war crimes to pay $105 million to relations of massacre victims. The Rwandan government was pleased that at least one suspect had been found guilty but troubled that the money was not allocated to build Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arms Flow</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to the culture of impunity, the flow of arms into the Great Lakes Region is another factor which exacerbates the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A UN commission of inquiry uncovered strong evidence that Zaire had a part in shipping arms to soldiers of the former Rwandan army living in the camps. In April, the UN Security Council decided the commission should continue probing the arms flow to the camps. UN observers are to monitor airfield and other transport points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN has also set up a trust fund to demilitarize central Africa and curb the flow of arms into the region. The trust fund will finance activities promoting &quot;confidence-Building measures&quot; and will support transparency in military acquisitions. An arms register will be set up.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - Because the crisis in Burundi has not degenerated into a full scale massacre such as that in Rwanda in 1994, the gravity of the present crisis has perhaps not yet fully penetrated our minds. With an estimated 100 people dying per week, tens of thousands of refugees still fleeing to Zaire and Tanzania, thousands more displaced from their homes within Burundi, the situation is comparable to an all-out, if undeclared, war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For a while the trouble was in Bujumbura and in the north; now it has spread to other parts of the country. Rebel soldiers have stepped up attacks in the south. Military observers said there have been seven attacks on Bururi in the last two weeks of May. The central province of Gitega, according to a senior military source, is caught in &quot;total war&quot; following the massacre in Buhoro of 235 civilians by the army after rebels had massacred some civilians there. Another massacre, for which the army is also blamed, of 200 people occurred in Bubanza (see map).The army continues to deny the massacres but eye witnesses have testified that they occurred. Human rights groups say that both rebels and the army almost routinely kill civilians.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bujumbura has been systematically ethnically cleansed (some call it &quot;Tutsiville&quot;). Hundreds of thousands of displaced people are sheltered and fed by aid groups. Rebels are now threatening Bujumbura; they say their purpose is not to attack but to get the army to talk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rebels, operating from Zaire, are believed to have gained ground this year. The President has criticized the army, saying guerrillas are operating with impunity both in the capital and in the interior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rebels appear to have access to sophisticated weapons, including land mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recently three Swiss workers for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) were killed in the North. Both sides are blaming the other; there was international protest at the killing of workers from a group such as ICRC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Positions of the Different Groups</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political analysts say the Hutu are alarmed by the Tutsi-dominated army while the Tutsi are afraid of the Hutu masses. Only dialogue can bring a solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Militarily, there are several groups involved:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - the Tutsi-dominated army which, according to many, is the real power in Burundi and is not under the control of the government. Some also believe that the army is the main cause of the instability. (The army has been in control of Burundi for years.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Tutsi militia, composed of Tutsi extremists, and probably backed by the army</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - CNDD (National Council for Defense and Democracy), the main rebel group operating from Zaire. It is pursuing an insurgency campaign to demand greater power. Its leader is Leonard Nyangoma, a former Minister in the government of the assassinated Pres. Melchior Ndadaye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - other Hutu militia, composed of extremists. Politically there are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - FRODEBU, the majority political party, mostly Hutu to which the President Sylvester Ntibantunganya, belongs and winner of the last elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - UPRONA, the opposition party, mainly Tutsi, to which the Prime Minister, Antoine Nduyawe belongs. The government is a fragile coalition of the two parties. Currently, the hard-liners on all sides refuse to negotiate.  The rebels say they will refuse until Ndadaye's assassins are brought to trial. The Tutsi military and UPRONA refuse to negotiate with rebels they say are advocating genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is becoming more and more difficult for the President and the Prime Minister to come together. The Prime Minister has refused to negotiate with Nyangoma. The latter, although he had last month vowed to overthrow the government, is now willing to negotiate with the army which he feels is the real power. The army is not willing and the President maintains the negotiations must be with the government and not the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is difficult to see how it can all be resolved and yet the only viable solution is through dialogue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The President has recently demanded more accountability from the army; it is not certain whether they will heed the call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Outside Intervention</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The extent of outside intervention does show a great amount of concern on the part of the international community. It has yet to prove effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Julius Nyerere, former Tanzanian President and OAU envoy. Many people have put their hopes in the mediation of Nyerere; he is highly respected by the Bunrundians themselves. But the first round of talks last month ended inconclusively. Only FRODEBU and UPRONA representatives were present; CNND and other rebels were not invited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two parties agreed to condemn violence and criminality in Burundi and to seek the support of the international community in ending the crisis.  But they could not agree on a formula of how to dismantle Hutu and Tutsi militias. Nyerere expressed regret at the decision not to invite the rebels.  A second round of talks was convened on June 4. It has also ended without real agreement. It was Nyerere's opinion that UPRONA was most responsible for the impasse. UPRONA was insisting that CNDD be condemned. Nyerere warned that time is running out for Burundi. Another round of talks is planned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. OAU</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The OAU renewed its observer mission to Burundi for three months; it now expires July 23. The OAU took this action to fulfill its responsibility and to support Nyerere's peace efforts. The mission. however, is strapped for funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. UN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Boutros Ghali has stated publicly his fears that Burundi may erupt like Rwanda. He recommended that the UN establish a standby force to intervene quickly in case of a major upsurge in violence. He said that organizing such a force is beyond UN capabilities but urged key member states to take the initiative. The U.S. has stated it is prepared to help with logistics, transport and communications but not troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile UPRONA, the army, the rebels all strongly denounce the idea of UN military intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Visits of U.S. envoys</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The number of envoys sent by the U.S. in April and May to visit Burundi shows there is a high level of concern:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Brian Atwood, head of USAID, gave the message that aid to Burundi would discontinue until there was meaningful dialogue with opposing parties.  Only emergency humanitarian aid would continue. Atwood traveled with Emma Bonino, the EU representative for humanitarian relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Richard Bogosian, the U.S. Special Coordinator for the region, asked the government to probe the recent massacre reports from Buhoro and Bubanza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - John Shattuck, Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, condemned the recent massacres and told the warring factions that the U.S.  would not recognize any government that came to power in a coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement to Congress, Shattuck said the extremists are manipulating ethnic differences for their own narrow ends. Moderates are afraid to exercise leadership and isolate extremists because of personal danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Anthony Lake, National Security Advisor, and George Moose, Assistant Secretary of State for Africa, paid a seven-hour visit to Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lake warned the extremists; He said he was dismayed by the deterioration of the situation since he visited 18 months ago. In talks with the President and Prime Minister, Lake said the tension in Burundi is a major focus of U.S.  foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a recent statement, the State Department has declared that genocide has been committed in Burundi by both sides. The U.S. is not under legal obligation to take action but because genocide is a violation of international law, cases of genocide may be taken to the UN and intervention sought. Tribunals may also be established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Relations with Zaire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the beginning of the year, an estimated 110,000 Burundian refugees were living in Zaire. This number has swelled in the last few months as thousands more fled to escape the recent violence. In an attempt, to stop the flow of refugees, Burundi in early May closed its side of the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In mid-May, the Prime Minister of Zaire, Kengo wa Dondo, visited Bujumbura. Although Zaire constantly denies that the refugee camps are havens for Hutu dissidents, it is well known that CNDD is operating from Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the talks, Burundi and Zaire decided to reactivate a joint committee in defense and security established in '95. The committee will examine the accusations and come up with suggestions on how to resolve the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Kengo's visit is seen as an attempt to restore normal relations, observers believe it was motivated by the economic pinch Zaire is feeling from the border closure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Schools in Burundi were affected by the border closure; Zairean teachers were stranded. Some schools had to close.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many Hutu members of the 81-seat national assembly, fearing assassination by Tutsi extremists, live in Zaire and commute to Bujumbura for the semi-annual parliamentary sessions.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - Monrovia in the last few weeks has faced what is now known as a &quot;semblance of peace.&quot; But war-wearied Liberians want more than a semblance of peace, they want the real thing: lasting and durable peace, an opportunity to put their lives back together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberia, perhaps more than any other nation in West Africa, has suffered sufficiently. After more than six years of a brutal civil war that has left more than 200,000 dead, 800,000 others as refugees and more than a million displaced, Liberia deserves the good-will of people everywhere to end their nightmare. They deserve a special support from the United States of America government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That is why when the United States reportedly committed additional funding for the peace efforts in Liberia, that pronouncement was greeted with gratitude. But the U.S. still has not delivered. This delay in delivering the promised required resources to ECOMOG has historically compounded the suffering of the Liberian people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following the signing of the Abuja Accord in August 1995, a donor conference was held in New York in October at which time the United States promised $10 million in support for peace keeping activities. Less than half of that money was disbursed before the April 6th flare-up in fighting. All along, the urgency for the delivery of the funding was established but the U.S. would not act speedily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has been at least three weeks since a degree of calm has returned to Monrovia. A partial disarmament of some of the fighters who were holed up at the Barclay Training Center has taken place. The momentum towards more disarmament is greater given the following variables:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A. The largest warring faction, the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) is in retreat. Mr. Taylor is reported to have set up a new military post in Totota. To coerce Mr. Taylor into disarming his men while he is in retreat is more likely than after he has regrouped and is re-supplied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> B. Some of the most hard-core fighters of the Liberia Peace Council (LPC), United Liberation Movement for Democracy- ULIMO/J faction is in Monrovia and more accessible. They can therefore be more easily disarmed and encamped but if they are allowed to return to the rural area, something which is now being allowed, it would be more difficult, if not futile, to disarm when they are in the bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> C. Peace keeping soldiers have been patrolling Monrovia effectively and have set up check points around Camp Schiefflein and the Pynesville intersection. This has enabled them to partially monitor movement into and out of Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> D. A seeming crack is occurring between the two allies - Taylor of the NPFL and Kromah of the ULIMO-K faction who visited upon the Liberian people their most recent rendezvous with deaths, mayhem and destruction. Whereas Taylor has stated that he wants elections in August come hell or hot water, Mr. Kromah has stated that disarmamment should take place before elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This momentum must be built upon. The peacekeepers need to be provided the necessary logistics they have continuously requested and have been promised on countless occasions but never delivered. These logistics including all-terrain vehicles, communication gears, field hospitals, and adequate funding must be delivered as a matter of urgency, if the United States is really serious about assisting the Liberian people end the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Additionally, the augmentation of the peacekeeping force must be pursued expeditiously. Perhaps one reason why April 6 occurred was because Liberian warlords were convinced that given ECOMOG lack of an overwhelming force in Monrovia, they could get away with whatever they wanted. They must not be provided with that option again. ECOMOG must have the strength it needs to deter any behaviour on the part of the Liberian warlords which would jeopardize the safety of Liberians in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberia's porous border with its neighbors, especially Guinea and La Cote d'Ivoire is cause for concern. The June 7 cross border raids by forces believed to be NPFL soldiers into Toulepleau, la Cote d'Ivoire, resulted in the death of 14 Liberian refugees. During the week of June 17, ULIMO-K forces, on an apparent foraging mission for food, over-ran the town of Yaragbara in Guinea wounding at least a dozen Liberian refugees. The death toll is yet to be announced. Earlier, on March 15 at least 35 persons were killed, several homes were burned down by the same group. The Guineans have now said that they will begin to pursue the rebel soldiers into Liberian territories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In order to prevent these cross border raids and the continuous flow of arms into Liberia, these borders need a more effective monitoring. Guinea and La Cote d'Ivoire have to be persuaded and supported to achieve that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ECOMOG's ability to return Monrovia, Buchanan and Kakata to their former safe haven status can only come about if a successful disarmament takes place. This will have the desired effect of convincing Liberians that they need not take to sea in unworthy sea vessels which are repeatedly denied docking rights by neighboring countries. No amount of condemnation from the rich nations of the world will make West African government take in these refugees, especially when these very rich nations are not perceived as urgently and concretely assisting the movement towards a peaceful settlement of the Liberian war. It is high time then, that promised assistance for the Liberian peace process be delivered immediately. For many Liberians, peace delayed is peace denied.<BR> For more information, contact the Africa Faith and Justice Network, a group of people of faith working towards positive change for the peoples of Africa, at PO Box 29378, Washington DC 20017; telephone 202 832 3412; fax 202 832 9051; e-mail afjn@igc.apc.org.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - The situation in Zaire has become more critical and more complicated in the last few months. Fierce fighting has broken out in Masisi, one of the most fertile areas in Zaire. Living in the area were Rwandan Hutus (Zairean Hutus now), some of whom have been there since the 1900's, Rwandan Tutsis who fled the violence in the 1950's, Zairean Tutsis who were in Zaire when the border was finalized, and other Zairean groups such as the Hunde.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fighting in this area has broken out from time to time over the years.  It has worsened since the large influx of Hutu refugees in '94.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What appears to be happening is that the refugees have moved from the camps into Hutu villages in Masisi and are now joining with the Hutus in Zaire to drive out the minority Tutsis and establish a &quot;Hutuland&quot; in this rich agricultural land of northeastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports over the last two months say that at least 65,000 Tutsis have been displaced from their homes in Masisi; 11,000 have fled to Rwanda. Camps must now be opened in Rwanda because Zairean Tutsis are not entitled to repatriation. Many of the refugees are traumatized after days of terror. In one area 3000 Tutsis are trapped in two villages because of the fighting and a massacre is feared. At least 100 Tutsis have already been e movement of the displaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile border raids from the camps into Rwanda continue. The Zairean troops have arrested more than 50 of the ringleaders in the camps. But refugees are still not going back in large numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Events in Rwanda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inside Rwanda, the security situation has worsened in some areas. It seems the rebels have become bolder and the army more on the defensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both sides have been involved in attacks. Some of the incidents which have been reported in recent months:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - A woman was slaughtered; the evidence indicated that she was killed by genocide criminals who want to exterminate disturbing survivors and witnesses (25 such cases have been documented by African Rights).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Infiltrators attacked a military prison in an attempt to free inmates; there was a clash with the army; the army killed at least 19 men (April).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - An armed gang burnt the entire Karengera township and freed the prisoners from the local prison (May).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Rebels from Zaire raided local government offices and attacked three villages in Cyangugu region, killing at least 37 people. This was the worst attack since the end of the war in '94. Cyangugu fears civil war will start again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Shortly after the above attack, infiltrators attacked a jail near the border and killed more than 30 prisoners. It is unclear why the prisoners were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Progress of Rwanda's Tribunal/Justice System</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After two years, the Tribunal has indicted only eleven suspects. It is greatly hampered by lack of funds and by rivalry with the Rwandan Government who wants to try the suspects itself. One of the chief suspects, Theoneste Bagosora, who was arrested in Cameroon, is wanted also by the Belgian government for the slaying of ten Belgian peacekeepers. Since Cameroon has no extradition treaty with Rwanda, it has been a haven for genocide suspects.  There is some indication, however, that Bagosora will be sent to the Tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three suspects from Zambia are to be arraigned and transferred to Arusha, the seat of the Tribunal. They will be the first to go on trial. They include: Clement Kayishema, former governor of Kibuye who allegedly helped organize the slaughters in Kibuye where 90% of Tutsi residents were killed; George Anderson Rutaganda and Jean Paul Akaseyu, both charged with organizing and leading massacres in other areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whereas the Tribunal has too few suspects in custody, the Rwandan justice system has too many. There are now more than 70,000 suspects in Rwanda's grossly overcrowded jails. Some attempts have been made to ameliorate prison conditions. And the Rwandan government is preparing to begin some trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a surprise move, a U.S. court ordered a Rwandan suspected of war crimes to pay $105 million to relations of massacre victims. The Rwandan government was pleased that at least one suspect had been found guilty but troubled that the money was not allocated to build Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arms Flow</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to the culture of impunity, the flow of arms into the Great Lakes Region is another factor which exacerbates the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A UN commission of inquiry uncovered strong evidence that Zaire had a part in shipping arms to soldiers of the former Rwandan army living in the camps. In April, the UN Security Council decided the commission should continue probing the arms flow to the camps. UN observers are to monitor airfield and other transport points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN has also set up a trust fund to demilitarize central Africa and curb the flow of arms into the region. The trust fund will finance activities promoting &quot;confidence-Building measures&quot; and will support transparency in military acquisitions. An arms register will be set up.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZPA chief executive, Valentine Chitalu, said in Livingstone yesterday during a ZPA forum organised for Southern Province businessmen that ZPA would soon announce modalities of the 80 percent sale of the part of ZCCM which will include Konkola and Mufulira mines.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said he was happy with the arragements so far reached and expected that the country would not be on the receiving end since all sales are aimed at improving the companies sold and making profit for the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Chitalu said there was a lot of transparency in the way ZPA was handling the privatisation of companies and that anybody was welcome to visit their offices to find out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several opposition political parties have spoken against the sale of ZCCM which they have said was the life line of the country, but the continued heavy burden assumed by government in sustaining the mines has prompted government to approve the sale of the mines.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZPA chief executive, Valentine Chitalu, accompanied by senior officials disclosed the sad development in Livingstone at Musi-wo-Tunya Hotel.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Chitalu said the Zambia Cashew Company upon which the entire cashewnut project is dependent has to be liquidated soonest because of the losses suffered by this ventures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He expressed worry at the fate of western province farmers who stopped the conventional farming methods and went through cashewnut growing saying the liquidation of the ZCC would affect their livehood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Chitalu claimed that foreign investors who would have taken over the project and made it into one of the most vibrant farming projects had been hindered by matters of land which is controlled by the Barostse Royal Establishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said investors were not secure after discovering the stronghold on land by the royal establishment and hence none had shown interest so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cashewnut project in Western Province developed problems after key shareholders BP Africa, Zambia State Insurance Corporation, Landell Mills and Zambia National Provident Fund slowly withdrew leaving ZCC with no support financially.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Farmers growing cashewnuts have to wait for ten years before any meaningful profit has to be seen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZAM-NEWS, a monthly publication of the Zambia Chamber of Commerce and Industry, says the exhibition will help to promote official trade between Zambia and Malawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The exhibition also aims at showing Chipata-based businessmen Zambian products which they can sell to Malawi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The publication notes that thousands of dollars worth of Zambian goods cross into Malawi every day by courtesy of the hundreds of cross border travellers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chamber of commerce and industry would like to encourage this trade formally because it increases output of members' factories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile the Zambia Association of Manufacturers (ZAM) has warned that without a real and lasting development of export markets, the country will sink into terminal depression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZAM recalled that in the aftermath of the second world war, the British government coined the slogan 'export or die' to regenerate its industry and the phrase can be taken literally for the Zambian situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The associations says in its monthly publication, Zam News, that there is a direct link between what a country produces for export and the standard of living of its citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ongoing discussions regarding the various bi-lateral and multi-lateral trade agreements offer a vast potential for Zambia to enter new markets and boost the country's export earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The association called for improved quality standard, competitiveness and market orienttion to boost exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The possibility of a real' level playing field' exists in various fora of negotiation and members must be ready to reap the benefits this will provide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The publication reveals that there are many organisations offering assitance to firms wishing to enter the export market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of them is the European development fund which has financed an export development programme mounted by the government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - An American firm has been sub-contracted to print the new voters cards by Nikuv Computers Limited because the Israeli company preparing the elections register has failed to produce them as per contract with government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The development has also resulted in government failing to send observers to witness the printing as demanded by the contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some cards have already been printed and are in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both director of elections Rabson Mwansa and his deputy Joel Sikazwe confirmed this in separate interviews on Thursday last week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I authorised the change after consulting the permanent secretary in the Vice-President's office, Philip Daka, and the Elections Commission chairman Justice Weston Muzyamba,&quot; Mwansa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nikuv Computers Limited project manager Gershon Korda said the printing of the cards in the United States was dictated by tight deadlines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Voters cards have been produced in the United States because that's where we found the best place to produce quality cards and meet the time table,&quot; Korda said in an interview on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Justice Muzyamba when approached at his office on Thursday declined to be interviewed without an appointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And while Mwansa claimed he was still waiting for authority for his men to travel to the United States to witness the printing of the cards, Korda said the trip had been cancelled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trip was intended for Zambians to witness and learn how work of this magnitude was being done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They cancelled their intention to visit the company. I had the names but it was their decision not to travel,&quot; Korda said. &quot;They gave a reason but I cannot tell you. Ask them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwansa also said his office had no choice but to approve the printing of cards in the United States because Nikuv cited the voter registration extensions as a reason for their failure to produce the cards in Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Nikuv said because of the extensions their contractors in Israel would not meet our deadline,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Korda said Nikuv Computers had planned to print the cards in Israel but because of numerous extensions their contractors were busy with other things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he declined to name the United States company producing the cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is in New Jersey. It's a supplier of our company. There is no reason to reveal our supplier without authorisation from the company in Israel,&quot; Korda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Sikazwe the company approached the elections office in the first week of May this year saying they could not produce the voters cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They asked if they could seek assistance from their fellow agencies in America. No company was mentioned and no specific town. Government gave a go ahead,&quot; Sikazwe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sikazwe insisted, a matter which was later confirmed by Mwansa, that there was no breach of contract involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am not aware if the change is a breach of contract. The contract is to produce voters cards and where it is done is immaterial,&quot; Sikazwe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He could not, however, comment on the quality of the cards or the provisional register because the elections office had not seen them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Until then we cannot comment on the quality. We are expecting them on July 11,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Mwansa, who said he had not consulted the Ministry of Legal Affairs, added that if there was any breach of contract it was up to lawyers to look into the matter. He also said that the issue of witnessing the printing of cards was not in the contract and that his office was awaiting authority from government before anyone can travel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Mwansa, his office has requested the new printers to start with Northern, Western and North Western Provinces and that some cards had started arriving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the Elections Office will from Friday this week mount briefing sessions for registration officers and provincial elections officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sikazwe confirmed this at a press briefing he addressed in Lusaka on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the programme has received criticism from the opposition UNIP because two of the briefings for six provinces will be held in Kitwe and Kafue which they view as intended to exclude the attendance of political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Briefing of elections officers in Kitwe and Kafue is intended to exclude political parties. What are they trying to change? All political leaders are expected to be briefed together with registration and election officers,&quot; said UNIP president Kenneth Kaunda in an interview on Thursday.  &quot;All parties must have confidence in the system, if in doubt everything breaks down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sikazwe, however, said the change was due to time factor and not because his office intends to exclude anyone. He said parties were free to attend briefings on July 13 in Kasama and Mongu and on July 18 in Chipata.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National political leaders will be briefed at a later date in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luisaka - Zambian featherweight boxer Emmanuel Siame, made a successful trip to Zimbabwe where he clinched a second round knock out of Mkabela Sisagiso last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is a very successful trip and Siame did not waste time as he knocked out the Zimbabwean just in the second round.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Mkabela had some bad cuts on his left eye. It was a very good fight for Siame and we were happy with the arrangements by the Zimbabwean promoters,&quot; said Iron Nkhoma and manager Felix Phiri who went to Zimbabwe with the boxer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is the second time the Zimbabwean is losing via a second round knock out after going down in just two rounds to Zambia's Pastor Pole in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And welterweight Stone Phiri will this Saturday at Star market make what he calls a &quot;grand come-back&quot; in the boxing ring after a long spell of inactivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am coming back this Saturday with a fight against Stanly Mabesi from Tanzania. Since this is my first come-back fight, I want to teach him a lesson and I will knock him out within ten rounds, I don't want to waste time,&quot; said the 34-year-old Phiri, in the company of his manager, William Mulenga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it is David Mpande, also set for a fight this Saturday that is overzealous of victory over fellow Zambian, Godwin Mutupuka. &quot;I will be through with him just within three rounds, I will first play around in round two and three before knocking him down in round three. Though people say he is fast, he will be taught a lesson this Saturday,&quot; said Mpande in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blantyre - Some Malawians - those who are frequent visitors to Asia - say that after taking a walk from Blantyre's premier Mount Soche Hotel down to the densely populated squatter settlement known as Mbayani, they are easily reminded of India, land of contrasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The state-of-the-art-designed buildings of Malawi's biggest city, Blantyre, perch on the hill that overlooks Mbayani and the small hovels and shacks that are home to 80, 000 people. And Mbayani is a staggering contrast to the affluent living style of its neighbour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the people of Mbayani live in abject poverty (as do the residents of Ndirande - with its more than 100,000 people - and Bangwe, Chimwankhunda and Chilobwe). They do not want to be reminded that they are now part of the second republic. They do not see much difference from what they have always experienced; see nothing changed in the new political climate - at least not socially or economically.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As a matter of fact, life is even harder today than it was two years ago,&quot; laments Selina Chimbaya. Unfortunately for Selina and many others in her shoes, inflation, to which the prohibitive cost of living in Malawi is attributed, is an animal she does not and will never understand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She says she hates to be reminded that today she is under a new administration which only 2 years ago promised to bring a semblance of class and prosperity to her life. &quot;The schools and clinics which were promised to us by the government are nowhere to be seen,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Martha Chisale adds fuel to this argument when she speaks of the irony of the fact that 75% of the pupils in schools in the city centre come from Mbayani, but Mbayani has no school of its own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our small children are at risk of being knocked down by cars as they cross the many roads to go to school,&quot; she pointed out. &quot;Where are our leaders who toured the slums on foot, going from house to house and apparently sympathising with us?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Bakili Muluzi has said that his government has a mission. That mission is to fulfil the promises spelt out in the UDF manifesto, but, as he said, for this they need time. However, without even the most basic amenities - water, health and recreational facilities - the waiting is hard, even for people who have no other option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sanitation does not exist in Mbayani and the huts are built too close to each other. This makes it difficult to dig a rubbish pit, pointed out one of the residents, Chifundo Phiri. As a result, people simply dump refuse in the streams, providing all the hazards of contaminated water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only a few of the residents of Mbayani have taps in or near their houses, and these few charge exorbitant prices to the others who use them.  And, naturally, with so many people living below the poverty line, the only other choice is water from the contaminated streams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbayani has no public health centre, despite being one of Blantyre's most densely populated areas. The nearest facility is the Queen Elizabeth Central hospital, seven kilometres away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One resident, Masauko Chingwalu, feels it is the local representatives in parliament who should shoulder the blame for the lack of development in their areas. Another blames the party for having a deaf ear when it comes to the suffering of people in places like Mbayani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others, however, find their own solutions for what it takes to have a happy life - and live in places like Mbayani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I chose to stay in Mbayani because this is within walking distance to my place of work,&quot; said civil servant, James Binali. &quot;But, living here is tough, so I drink. What else is life for. It is the only way to forget one's miseries and hope that tomorrow will be brighter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - On May 8th, 1996, the Republic of South Africa promulgated its first non-racial Constitution, thereby officially ending the transition from apartheid to universal democracy. The new document establishes the framework for a society which respects the rights of all individuals, regardless of age, race, or sex. However, the Constitution is not without its points of contention.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most importantly, the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), which controls the KwaZulu/Natal provincial legislature, has boycotted the Constitutional Assembly to protest the document's federal character. Led by Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha has consistently opposed a strong central government.  Despite the IFP boycott and repeated calls for international mediation, the Constitutional Assembly outlined specific powers reserved solely for the provinces, such as road-building and sports administration. Ultimately, the battle for federalism/confederalism will have to be fought in the nation's new Constitutional Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Additionally, several Afrikaner-based groups decried the new Constitution for its emphasis on universal standards of education. They feel that the Afrikaans language is an integral part of their ethnic identity and have been actively promoting the idea of single-language schools. Although these groups were unable to muster significant support for their proposal, the new document does not necessarily outlaw single-language schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lastly, the African National Congress (ANC), the party most responsible for the new Constitution, has been divided by a &quot;lock-out&quot; clause which would guarantee employers the right to lock out striking employees. While the ANC's traditional base of support in the labour unions has vehemently protested the clause, the party's more progressive wing has acknowledged that such a clause would improve South Africa's tarnished image as a country with labour problems. In an effort to block the inclusion of the clause, the labour unions staged a one-day, nation-wide strike on April 30th. However, the strike was poorly attended and an obscure reference to a labour relations code was unceremoniously inserted into the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All in all, South Africa's first non-racial Constitution remains purposefully vague on a number of divisive issues like regional powers, single-language schools, and employer's rights. The document's authors recognized the futility of trying to prepare for every possible situation that might arise. Instead, the constitutional negotiators concentrated on the new society they were building and unambiguously depicted the rights and prerogatives of the individuals therein.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - On April 26, 1996, the UN Security Council voted - 13 to 0 with Russia and China abstaining - to impose diplomatic sanctions against the Sudan. Sudan had passed the deadline for handing over three suspects in the attempted assassination of Egyptian President Mubarak; Sudan is allegedly harboring the suspects. The sanctions included reducing the number of Sudanese diplomats in a country, departure of terrorist groups with headquarters in Sudan and banning of international conferences in the Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sanctions were milder than the U.S., Britain and Ethiopia had hoped for. Egypt, who at first had pressed for harsher sanctions, backed down in the end, saying economic sanctions would make the Sudanese suffer and an arms embargo would endanger the unity of the Sudan. Egypt would not like to see an independent Southern Sudan controlling the waters of the Nile on which Egypt is so dependent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Security Council gave the Sudan two weeks to turn over the suspects.  After this the sanctions went into effect, to be reviewed in two months' time if the suspects are still not handed over. This will be early July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Russia and China abstained because they feel sanctions on the Sudan is one embargo too many. They, plus others, including Iran, and Syria, have stated they will not adhere to that part of he sanctions which asks governments to reduce the number of Sudanese diplomats in their country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sudan has said the sanctions are inconvenient but not crippling. It has also said it will screen foreign organizations based in the Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Civil War</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The war can no longer be called &quot;the war in the South.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has spread to the Nuba Mountains for some time now. And there are recent reports that the Sudan Allied Forces (SAF), one of the military wings of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), has launched attacks in the North, near the town of Kassala. The SAF is a splinter group of former Sudanese army troops who escaped Sudan after the '89 coup. 2. Several of the SPLA factions (headed by Riek Machar, Kerubino Kwanyin Bol,) have signed a &quot;political charter&quot; with Khartoum; it is supposed to be the initiation of a peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most analysts are not taking the charter seriously. It has been denounced by Garang as a &quot;sell-out&quot;. (Garang has been joined by another splinter faction, headed by John Luc.) surprisingly, the charter has gained support from Joseph Lagu, a former vice-president under Nimeiri, who had been living outside Sudan for the last three years. He still commands some support in the South, especially his home region of Equatoria. He has just returned to the Sudan. 3. The situation in the Nuba Mountains continues to worsen. It is not considered the &quot;South&quot; and is therefore not eligible for OLS (Operation Lifeline Sudan) relief. Reports of atrocities continue - villages burned and looted, people rounded up into &quot;peace camps&quot;which are more like concentration camps, land taken over by mechanized framing - but because very few people have access to the Nuba Mountains, hard evidence is difficult to come by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One issue which perhaps needs more emphasis and which affects the Nuba, the SPLA and the northern opposition is the question of land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For ordinary people in the South and the marginalised areas of the North, one of the main reasons why they are fighting is because of land.  People became fed up with government officials and merchants seizing their ancestral lands; they took up arms to defend what was rightfully theirs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even before the recent atrocities, there has been a history of land confiscation. And to make matters worse, the land is being confiscated by rich merchants who use mechanized farming. It is well documented that mechanical cultivation rapidly degrades the topsoil, making the land vulnerable to wind erosion. Commercial farmers (mostly NIF supporters) are given 25-year leases on the land; the farmers exploit the land ruthlessly so that after a few years the land is so degraded that it is unusable. This has happened already in the North.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government has been redistributing land to reward its followers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The issue of land, along with the issues of sharia law and self-determination, will have to be dealt with in any peace negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IMF Relations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In early May an IMF team spent a week in the Sudan. A report will be issued later on Sudan's economy in the period between January and April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Relations with the IMF have been difficult for a decade because of Sudan's failure to pay arrears which have now reached $1.7 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Relations took a turn for the better last year when Khartoum began to make a token payment of $4 million per month as a sign of good will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The talks ended without a debt arrears pact. The IMF is expected to discuss its relations with Sudan at a meeting in August.<BR> For more information, contact the Africa Faith and Justice Network, a group of people of faith working towards positive change for the peoples of Africa, at PO Box 29378, Washington DC 20017; telephone 202 832 3412; fax 202 832 9051; e-mail afjn@igc.apc.org.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - The situation in Zaire has become more critical and more complicated in the last few months. Fierce fighting has broken out in Masisi, one of the most fertile areas in Zaire. Living in the area were Rwandan Hutus (Zairean Hutus now), some of whom have been there since the 1900's, Rwandan Tutsis who fled the violence in the 1950's, Zairean Tutsis who were in Zaire when the border was finalized, and other Zairean groups such as the Hunde.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fighting in this area has broken out from time to time over the years.  It has worsened since the large influx of Hutu refugees in '94.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What appears to be happening is that the refugees have moved from the camps into Hutu villages in Masisi and are now joining with the Hutus in Zaire to drive out the minority Tutsis and establish a &quot;Hutuland&quot; in this rich agricultural land of northeastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports over the last two months say that at least 65,000 Tutsis have been displaced from their homes in Masisi; 11,000 have fled to Rwanda. Camps must now be opened in Rwanda because Zairean Tutsis are not entitled to repatriation. Many of the refugees are traumatized after days of terror. In one area 3000 Tutsis are trapped in two villages because of the fighting and a massacre is feared. At least 100 Tutsis have already been e movement of the displaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile border raids from the camps into Rwanda continue. The Zairean troops have arrested more than 50 of the ringleaders in the camps. But refugees are still not going back in large numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Events in Rwanda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inside Rwanda, the security situation has worsened in some areas. It seems the rebels have become bolder and the army more on the defensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both sides have been involved in attacks. Some of the incidents which have been reported in recent months:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - A woman was slaughtered; the evidence indicated that she was killed by genocide criminals who want to exterminate disturbing survivors and witnesses (25 such cases have been documented by African Rights).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Infiltrators attacked a military prison in an attempt to free inmates; there was a clash with the army; the army killed at least 19 men (April).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - An armed gang burnt the entire Karengera township and freed the prisoners from the local prison (May).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Rebels from Zaire raided local government offices and attacked three villages in Cyangugu region, killing at least 37 people. This was the worst attack since the end of the war in '94. Cyangugu fears civil war will start again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Shortly after the above attack, infiltrators attacked a jail near the border and killed more than 30 prisoners. It is unclear why the prisoners were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Progress of Rwanda's Tribunal/Justice System</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After two years, the Tribunal has indicted only eleven suspects. It is greatly hampered by lack of funds and by rivalry with the Rwandan Government who wants to try the suspects itself. One of the chief suspects, Theoneste Bagosora, who was arrested in Cameroon, is wanted also by the Belgian government for the slaying of ten Belgian peacekeepers. Since Cameroon has no extradition treaty with Rwanda, it has been a haven for genocide suspects.  There is some indication, however, that Bagosora will be sent to the Tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three suspects from Zambia are to be arraigned and transferred to Arusha, the seat of the Tribunal. They will be the first to go on trial. They include: Clement Kayishema, former governor of Kibuye who allegedly helped organize the slaughters in Kibuye where 90% of Tutsi residents were killed; George Anderson Rutaganda and Jean Paul Akaseyu, both charged with organizing and leading massacres in other areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whereas the Tribunal has too few suspects in custody, the Rwandan justice system has too many. There are now more than 70,000 suspects in Rwanda's grossly overcrowded jails. Some attempts have been made to ameliorate prison conditions. And the Rwandan government is preparing to begin some trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a surprise move, a U.S. court ordered a Rwandan suspected of war crimes to pay $105 million to relations of massacre victims. The Rwandan government was pleased that at least one suspect had been found guilty but troubled that the money was not allocated to build Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arms Flow</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to the culture of impunity, the flow of arms into the Great Lakes Region is another factor which exacerbates the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A UN commission of inquiry uncovered strong evidence that Zaire had a part in shipping arms to soldiers of the former Rwandan army living in the camps. In April, the UN Security Council decided the commission should continue probing the arms flow to the camps. UN observers are to monitor airfield and other transport points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN has also set up a trust fund to demilitarize central Africa and curb the flow of arms into the region. The trust fund will finance activities promoting &quot;confidence-Building measures&quot; and will support transparency in military acquisitions. An arms register will be set up.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - Because the crisis in Burundi has not degenerated into a full scale massacre such as that in Rwanda in 1994, the gravity of the present crisis has perhaps not yet fully penetrated our minds. With an estimated 100 people dying per week, tens of thousands of refugees still fleeing to Zaire and Tanzania, thousands more displaced from their homes within Burundi, the situation is comparable to an all-out, if undeclared, war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For a while the trouble was in Bujumbura and in the north; now it has spread to other parts of the country. Rebel soldiers have stepped up attacks in the south. Military observers said there have been seven attacks on Bururi in the last two weeks of May. The central province of Gitega, according to a senior military source, is caught in &quot;total war&quot; following the massacre in Buhoro of 235 civilians by the army after rebels had massacred some civilians there. Another massacre, for which the army is also blamed, of 200 people occurred in Bubanza (see map).The army continues to deny the massacres but eye witnesses have testified that they occurred. Human rights groups say that both rebels and the army almost routinely kill civilians.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bujumbura has been systematically ethnically cleansed (some call it &quot;Tutsiville&quot;). Hundreds of thousands of displaced people are sheltered and fed by aid groups. Rebels are now threatening Bujumbura; they say their purpose is not to attack but to get the army to talk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rebels, operating from Zaire, are believed to have gained ground this year. The President has criticized the army, saying guerrillas are operating with impunity both in the capital and in the interior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rebels appear to have access to sophisticated weapons, including land mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recently three Swiss workers for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) were killed in the North. Both sides are blaming the other; there was international protest at the killing of workers from a group such as ICRC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Positions of the Different Groups</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political analysts say the Hutu are alarmed by the Tutsi-dominated army while the Tutsi are afraid of the Hutu masses. Only dialogue can bring a solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Militarily, there are several groups involved:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - the Tutsi-dominated army which, according to many, is the real power in Burundi and is not under the control of the government. Some also believe that the army is the main cause of the instability. (The army has been in control of Burundi for years.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Tutsi militia, composed of Tutsi extremists, and probably backed by the army</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - CNDD (National Council for Defense and Democracy), the main rebel group operating from Zaire. It is pursuing an insurgency campaign to demand greater power. Its leader is Leonard Nyangoma, a former Minister in the government of the assassinated Pres. Melchior Ndadaye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - other Hutu militia, composed of extremists. Politically there are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - FRODEBU, the majority political party, mostly Hutu to which the President Sylvester Ntibantunganya, belongs and winner of the last elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - UPRONA, the opposition party, mainly Tutsi, to which the Prime Minister, Antoine Nduyawe belongs. The government is a fragile coalition of the two parties. Currently, the hard-liners on all sides refuse to negotiate.  The rebels say they will refuse until Ndadaye's assassins are brought to trial. The Tutsi military and UPRONA refuse to negotiate with rebels they say are advocating genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is becoming more and more difficult for the President and the Prime Minister to come together. The Prime Minister has refused to negotiate with Nyangoma. The latter, although he had last month vowed to overthrow the government, is now willing to negotiate with the army which he feels is the real power. The army is not willing and the President maintains the negotiations must be with the government and not the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is difficult to see how it can all be resolved and yet the only viable solution is through dialogue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The President has recently demanded more accountability from the army; it is not certain whether they will heed the call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Outside Intervention</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The extent of outside intervention does show a great amount of concern on the part of the international community. It has yet to prove effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Julius Nyerere, former Tanzanian President and OAU envoy. Many people have put their hopes in the mediation of Nyerere; he is highly respected by the Bunrundians themselves. But the first round of talks last month ended inconclusively. Only FRODEBU and UPRONA representatives were present; CNND and other rebels were not invited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two parties agreed to condemn violence and criminality in Burundi and to seek the support of the international community in ending the crisis.  But they could not agree on a formula of how to dismantle Hutu and Tutsi militias. Nyerere expressed regret at the decision not to invite the rebels.  A second round of talks was convened on June 4. It has also ended without real agreement. It was Nyerere's opinion that UPRONA was most responsible for the impasse. UPRONA was insisting that CNDD be condemned. Nyerere warned that time is running out for Burundi. Another round of talks is planned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. OAU</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The OAU renewed its observer mission to Burundi for three months; it now expires July 23. The OAU took this action to fulfill its responsibility and to support Nyerere's peace efforts. The mission. however, is strapped for funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. UN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Boutros Ghali has stated publicly his fears that Burundi may erupt like Rwanda. He recommended that the UN establish a standby force to intervene quickly in case of a major upsurge in violence. He said that organizing such a force is beyond UN capabilities but urged key member states to take the initiative. The U.S. has stated it is prepared to help with logistics, transport and communications but not troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile UPRONA, the army, the rebels all strongly denounce the idea of UN military intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Visits of U.S. envoys</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The number of envoys sent by the U.S. in April and May to visit Burundi shows there is a high level of concern:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Brian Atwood, head of USAID, gave the message that aid to Burundi would discontinue until there was meaningful dialogue with opposing parties.  Only emergency humanitarian aid would continue. Atwood traveled with Emma Bonino, the EU representative for humanitarian relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Richard Bogosian, the U.S. Special Coordinator for the region, asked the government to probe the recent massacre reports from Buhoro and Bubanza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - John Shattuck, Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, condemned the recent massacres and told the warring factions that the U.S.  would not recognize any government that came to power in a coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement to Congress, Shattuck said the extremists are manipulating ethnic differences for their own narrow ends. Moderates are afraid to exercise leadership and isolate extremists because of personal danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Anthony Lake, National Security Advisor, and George Moose, Assistant Secretary of State for Africa, paid a seven-hour visit to Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lake warned the extremists; He said he was dismayed by the deterioration of the situation since he visited 18 months ago. In talks with the President and Prime Minister, Lake said the tension in Burundi is a major focus of U.S.  foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a recent statement, the State Department has declared that genocide has been committed in Burundi by both sides. The U.S. is not under legal obligation to take action but because genocide is a violation of international law, cases of genocide may be taken to the UN and intervention sought. Tribunals may also be established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Relations with Zaire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the beginning of the year, an estimated 110,000 Burundian refugees were living in Zaire. This number has swelled in the last few months as thousands more fled to escape the recent violence. In an attempt, to stop the flow of refugees, Burundi in early May closed its side of the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In mid-May, the Prime Minister of Zaire, Kengo wa Dondo, visited Bujumbura. Although Zaire constantly denies that the refugee camps are havens for Hutu dissidents, it is well known that CNDD is operating from Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the talks, Burundi and Zaire decided to reactivate a joint committee in defense and security established in '95. The committee will examine the accusations and come up with suggestions on how to resolve the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Kengo's visit is seen as an attempt to restore normal relations, observers believe it was motivated by the economic pinch Zaire is feeling from the border closure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Schools in Burundi were affected by the border closure; Zairean teachers were stranded. Some schools had to close.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many Hutu members of the 81-seat national assembly, fearing assassination by Tutsi extremists, live in Zaire and commute to Bujumbura for the semi-annual parliamentary sessions.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - Monrovia in the last few weeks has faced what is now known as a &quot;semblance of peace.&quot; But war-wearied Liberians want more than a semblance of peace, they want the real thing: lasting and durable peace, an opportunity to put their lives back together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberia, perhaps more than any other nation in West Africa, has suffered sufficiently. After more than six years of a brutal civil war that has left more than 200,000 dead, 800,000 others as refugees and more than a million displaced, Liberia deserves the good-will of people everywhere to end their nightmare. They deserve a special support from the United States of America government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That is why when the United States reportedly committed additional funding for the peace efforts in Liberia, that pronouncement was greeted with gratitude. But the U.S. still has not delivered. This delay in delivering the promised required resources to ECOMOG has historically compounded the suffering of the Liberian people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following the signing of the Abuja Accord in August 1995, a donor conference was held in New York in October at which time the United States promised $10 million in support for peace keeping activities. Less than half of that money was disbursed before the April 6th flare-up in fighting. All along, the urgency for the delivery of the funding was established but the U.S. would not act speedily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has been at least three weeks since a degree of calm has returned to Monrovia. A partial disarmament of some of the fighters who were holed up at the Barclay Training Center has taken place. The momentum towards more disarmament is greater given the following variables:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A. The largest warring faction, the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) is in retreat. Mr. Taylor is reported to have set up a new military post in Totota. To coerce Mr. Taylor into disarming his men while he is in retreat is more likely than after he has regrouped and is re-supplied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> B. Some of the most hard-core fighters of the Liberia Peace Council (LPC), United Liberation Movement for Democracy- ULIMO/J faction is in Monrovia and more accessible. They can therefore be more easily disarmed and encamped but if they are allowed to return to the rural area, something which is now being allowed, it would be more difficult, if not futile, to disarm when they are in the bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> C. Peace keeping soldiers have been patrolling Monrovia effectively and have set up check points around Camp Schiefflein and the Pynesville intersection. This has enabled them to partially monitor movement into and out of Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> D. A seeming crack is occurring between the two allies - Taylor of the NPFL and Kromah of the ULIMO-K faction who visited upon the Liberian people their most recent rendezvous with deaths, mayhem and destruction. Whereas Taylor has stated that he wants elections in August come hell or hot water, Mr. Kromah has stated that disarmamment should take place before elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This momentum must be built upon. The peacekeepers need to be provided the necessary logistics they have continuously requested and have been promised on countless occasions but never delivered. These logistics including all-terrain vehicles, communication gears, field hospitals, and adequate funding must be delivered as a matter of urgency, if the United States is really serious about assisting the Liberian people end the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Additionally, the augmentation of the peacekeeping force must be pursued expeditiously. Perhaps one reason why April 6 occurred was because Liberian warlords were convinced that given ECOMOG lack of an overwhelming force in Monrovia, they could get away with whatever they wanted. They must not be provided with that option again. ECOMOG must have the strength it needs to deter any behaviour on the part of the Liberian warlords which would jeopardize the safety of Liberians in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberia's porous border with its neighbors, especially Guinea and La Cote d'Ivoire is cause for concern. The June 7 cross border raids by forces believed to be NPFL soldiers into Toulepleau, la Cote d'Ivoire, resulted in the death of 14 Liberian refugees. During the week of June 17, ULIMO-K forces, on an apparent foraging mission for food, over-ran the town of Yaragbara in Guinea wounding at least a dozen Liberian refugees. The death toll is yet to be announced. Earlier, on March 15 at least 35 persons were killed, several homes were burned down by the same group. The Guineans have now said that they will begin to pursue the rebel soldiers into Liberian territories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In order to prevent these cross border raids and the continuous flow of arms into Liberia, these borders need a more effective monitoring. Guinea and La Cote d'Ivoire have to be persuaded and supported to achieve that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ECOMOG's ability to return Monrovia, Buchanan and Kakata to their former safe haven status can only come about if a successful disarmament takes place. This will have the desired effect of convincing Liberians that they need not take to sea in unworthy sea vessels which are repeatedly denied docking rights by neighboring countries. No amount of condemnation from the rich nations of the world will make West African government take in these refugees, especially when these very rich nations are not perceived as urgently and concretely assisting the movement towards a peaceful settlement of the Liberian war. It is high time then, that promised assistance for the Liberian peace process be delivered immediately. For many Liberians, peace delayed is peace denied.<BR> For more information, contact the Africa Faith and Justice Network, a group of people of faith working towards positive change for the peoples of Africa, at PO Box 29378, Washington DC 20017; telephone 202 832 3412; fax 202 832 9051; e-mail afjn@igc.apc.org.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - The situation in Zaire has become more critical and more complicated in the last few months. Fierce fighting has broken out in Masisi, one of the most fertile areas in Zaire. Living in the area were Rwandan Hutus (Zairean Hutus now), some of whom have been there since the 1900's, Rwandan Tutsis who fled the violence in the 1950's, Zairean Tutsis who were in Zaire when the border was finalized, and other Zairean groups such as the Hunde.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fighting in this area has broken out from time to time over the years.  It has worsened since the large influx of Hutu refugees in '94.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What appears to be happening is that the refugees have moved from the camps into Hutu villages in Masisi and are now joining with the Hutus in Zaire to drive out the minority Tutsis and establish a &quot;Hutuland&quot; in this rich agricultural land of northeastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports over the last two months say that at least 65,000 Tutsis have been displaced from their homes in Masisi; 11,000 have fled to Rwanda. Camps must now be opened in Rwanda because Zairean Tutsis are not entitled to repatriation. Many of the refugees are traumatized after days of terror. In one area 3000 Tutsis are trapped in two villages because of the fighting and a massacre is feared. At least 100 Tutsis have already been e movement of the displaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile border raids from the camps into Rwanda continue. The Zairean troops have arrested more than 50 of the ringleaders in the camps. But refugees are still not going back in large numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Events in Rwanda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inside Rwanda, the security situation has worsened in some areas. It seems the rebels have become bolder and the army more on the defensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both sides have been involved in attacks. Some of the incidents which have been reported in recent months:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - A woman was slaughtered; the evidence indicated that she was killed by genocide criminals who want to exterminate disturbing survivors and witnesses (25 such cases have been documented by African Rights).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Infiltrators attacked a military prison in an attempt to free inmates; there was a clash with the army; the army killed at least 19 men (April).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - An armed gang burnt the entire Karengera township and freed the prisoners from the local prison (May).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Rebels from Zaire raided local government offices and attacked three villages in Cyangugu region, killing at least 37 people. This was the worst attack since the end of the war in '94. Cyangugu fears civil war will start again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Shortly after the above attack, infiltrators attacked a jail near the border and killed more than 30 prisoners. It is unclear why the prisoners were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Progress of Rwanda's Tribunal/Justice System</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After two years, the Tribunal has indicted only eleven suspects. It is greatly hampered by lack of funds and by rivalry with the Rwandan Government who wants to try the suspects itself. One of the chief suspects, Theoneste Bagosora, who was arrested in Cameroon, is wanted also by the Belgian government for the slaying of ten Belgian peacekeepers. Since Cameroon has no extradition treaty with Rwanda, it has been a haven for genocide suspects.  There is some indication, however, that Bagosora will be sent to the Tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three suspects from Zambia are to be arraigned and transferred to Arusha, the seat of the Tribunal. They will be the first to go on trial. They include: Clement Kayishema, former governor of Kibuye who allegedly helped organize the slaughters in Kibuye where 90% of Tutsi residents were killed; George Anderson Rutaganda and Jean Paul Akaseyu, both charged with organizing and leading massacres in other areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whereas the Tribunal has too few suspects in custody, the Rwandan justice system has too many. There are now more than 70,000 suspects in Rwanda's grossly overcrowded jails. Some attempts have been made to ameliorate prison conditions. And the Rwandan government is preparing to begin some trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a surprise move, a U.S. court ordered a Rwandan suspected of war crimes to pay $105 million to relations of massacre victims. The Rwandan government was pleased that at least one suspect had been found guilty but troubled that the money was not allocated to build Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arms Flow</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to the culture of impunity, the flow of arms into the Great Lakes Region is another factor which exacerbates the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A UN commission of inquiry uncovered strong evidence that Zaire had a part in shipping arms to soldiers of the former Rwandan army living in the camps. In April, the UN Security Council decided the commission should continue probing the arms flow to the camps. UN observers are to monitor airfield and other transport points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN has also set up a trust fund to demilitarize central Africa and curb the flow of arms into the region. The trust fund will finance activities promoting &quot;confidence-Building measures&quot; and will support transparency in military acquisitions. An arms register will be set up.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> YAOUNDE, Cameroon (PANA) - The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) is seriously considering calling for the imposition of severe international sanctions against war-torn Liberia and the setting up of a war crimes tribunal against the leadership of the country's warring factions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The O.A.U. Council of Ministers meeting in Yaounde, the Cameroonian capital, has proposed a resolution recommending the non-recognition of any Liberian government which comes into office through the use of force or violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberia, Africa's oldest republic, has been ravaged by a brutal civil war since 1989, which has spawned a frightening refugee crisis as several warring factions wreak mayhem and destruction on the west African nation of 2.5 million people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If approved by the heads of state and government at their 32nd ordinary conference from July 8 to 10, the resolution will also give teeth to the West African Peace-Monitoring Force (ECOMOG), changing its mandate from peace-keeping to peace-enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The resolution sends a strong message to Liberian faction leaders such as Charles Taylor, Roosevelt Johnson and Alhaji Kromah, warning them that should the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) assessment of the peace process turn out to be negative, the O.A.U. would help sponsor a draft resolution in the United Nations Security Council for the imposition of severe sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This will include the possibility of setting up a war crimes tribunal similar to the one on the Rwanda genocide, to try the leadership of the factions on the violation of the human rights of innocent civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The resolution also calls on the warring factions to return all items looted from the capital, Monrovia, during the recent round of fighting in April to their rightful owners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It urges the international community to scrupulously comply with the arms embargo imposed on the warring factions by the U.N. Security Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Burundi, the ministers, also proposed a resolution expressing &quot;very serious&quot; concern on the &quot;very unstable&quot;, tense and politically polarized situation that continued to prevail in a nation torn apart by ethnic fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The resolution entrusts the central organ of the O.A.U. on conflict prevention and management to pursue its efforts to prevent a further deterioration of the situation in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 150,000 people have been killed in the past three years in clashes between the majority, but underclass Hutus and the minority but economically powerful Tutsis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The resolution also requests the Secretary-General of the O.A.U., Salim Ahmed Salim, to persevere in his efforts to find a lasting solution to the conflict in Burundi and to report to the next session of the council of ministers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LIBREVILLE, Gabon (PANA) - A summit of African member countries of the African Development<BR>Bank is scheduled to begin Sunday in Libreville, capital of Gabon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The one-day meeting, initiated by president Omar Bongo, will focus on the administration of the bank group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Attention will be on solving the problem of the difficult working relationship between the board of governors and the president of bank.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The issue of arrears of contributions, estimated 820 million U.S.  dollars will also be discussed, to enable the finance institution to play its role of mobilizing investment funds for African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bank had been hit by a serious financial crisis. Its net profit dropped by half in two years, from 165.2 million dollars in 1992 to 77 million in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Its loan portfolio also fell by 60 percent in three years, from 3.4 billion dollars to 1.4 billion in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the African Development Fund, which provides soft loans to the continent's poorest countries, was recently replenished after two and a half years of paralysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The replenishment of the fund allows the bank to resume disbursement of loans to 39 poor African countries which do not qualify for loans from the ADB proper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Out of the 53 member countries of the bank, only a dozen are qualified for its loans at prevailing market interest rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Set up in 1963, the bank groups 53 African countries and 24 non-regional countries, among them the United States, Germany, France and Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Libreville summit will be preceded a meeting of Finance ministers who represent their countries at the bank's annual board of governors meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the last such meeting in Abidjan in May, some African members rejected demands by the non-regional share holders that the capital base of the bank be restructured to give them equal powers with its African owners, prompting Bongo's intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Currently, the 53 African countries own two-thirds of ADB shares as against one-third for the non-African countries. The bank's total assets are currently estimated at some 33 billion U.S. dollars.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MAPUTO, (PANA) - Zimbabwean dissidents known as Chimwenjes are now under the command of a<BR>demobilized general of Mozambique's former anti-government movement Renamo, the Beira daily newspaper, Diario de Mocambique, reported Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The newspaper named the general as Armando Mabache, and also claimed that the Chimwenjes have moved their main base inside Mozambique closer to the Zimbabwean border. They have abandoned the Zomba area, and have set up camp in the Chimanimani mountains, on the boundary between Sussundenga and Mossurize districts, in Mozambique's Manica province.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The newspaper suggests that the Chimwenjes were preparing to set up their military logistics and launch an offensive into Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their ultimate goal is said to overthrow the Zimbabwean government of President Robert Mugabe. Captured Chimwenjes have said that the group is the armed wing of the small Zimbabwean opposition party, ZANU-Ndonga. This party is led by Ndabaningi Sithole, who is currently facing charges of plotting to assassinate Mugabe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Chimwenjes, who were captured January in a clash with the police, also told reporters that they were allied with Renamo during the war of destabilization funded by apartheid South Africa, against the Mozambican government. However, Renamo leaders have repeatedly denied any link to the Chimwenjes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mossurize district administrator, Eduardo Gimo, told the newspaper that over the last two months the Chimwenjes, under Mabache's command, had looted two kiosks and a shop, and raped two nieces of a local Regulo (a quasi-traditional chief). Several other women have been kidnapped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the former chairman of the Mozambican parliament, veteran nationalist Marcelino Dos Santos, has accused Renamo of being &quot;deeply involved&quot; with the Chimwenjes, and has called for a national crusade against the Zimbabwean group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cited in Friday's issue of the Maputo daily newspaper, Noticias, Dos Santos declared &quot;from the village up to the city the whole people should be politically and militarily mobilized to face this kind of aggression.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked what proof he had of continued links between Renamo and the Chimwenjes, Dos Santos said, &quot;That's for later. Right now I'm just stating it. And it is not you (reporters) to whom I will present the proof.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dos Santos said the Chimwenjes might grow into a major force just as Renamo had done. However, unlike Renamo which enjoyed the support of apartheid South Africa, the Chimwenjes are not backed by any regional power.  Furthermore, captured Chimwenjes put their total strength at less than 40.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - &quot;Africa is not geography. Africa is demography,&quot; said Rex Nettleford, a history and political science professor at the University of the West Indies in Kingston, Jamaica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is Africa wherever you find people of African origin,&quot; said Nettleford who is also the founder and artistic director of the acclaimed National Dance Theater Company of Jamaica, which draws inspiration from African dance and music tradition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nettleford is unhappy that this tradition is fast disappearing under the weight of the continent's economic, social and political problems which, he argues, should be the concern of the negroid race.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This summation may sound strange to some people in a continent where ethnic strife and sectionalism have replaced the peoples' time-honored tradition of being their brothers' keeper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Rwanda and Burundi in central Africa, an estimated 1.2 million people have been killed in ethnic wars in the past three years. Similarly, in Ghana, Liberia, Nigeria and South Africa, hundreds of people have been killed in ethnic clashes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Border skirmishes are becoming increasingly common. Some governments expel hundreds of thousands of immigrants from neighboring countries on the slightest pretext. In some cases, eminent people who fought hard for independence have suddenly lost their citizenship in the life-and-death struggle for political power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People of various ethnic groups now mutually refer to each other in derogatory terms: some unprintable here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today's Africans prefer to identify themselves in terms of geographical location (West Africans, East Africans), language (Anglophone, Francophone, Lusophone) and even by religion (Christian, Muslim, animist).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given this scenario, one wonders if these are the same people to whom Nettleford attributes a common ancestry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Is this the Africa for which Revered Leon Sullivan and others have deployed enormous efforts in the past three decades to redeem?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alas, one ceases to wonder, when one recalls that the Pan-Africanist movements which began in the late 18th century, though spurred by the sad history of the black race, were rooted in the African Diaspora.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The trans-Atlantic slave trade is no more. Many of us have become part and parcel of the decision-making process in our countries. But we are still fighting for the goals of emancipation,&quot; Nettleford told this writer in Amman (Jordan), where he, and other educationists, attended the recent forum on Education For All.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others have said as much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Africa is suffering from bad leadership and disunity,&quot; under oppressive neo-colonial forces, said Louis Farrakhan, leader the Nation of Islam, during a trip to a number of African countries in November 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those who have cared to look at the situation of Africans over the years agree that the majority of them are, by far, worse off now than they were after independence some 30 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Worst hit is sub-Sahara Africa, an area which some people prefer to call Black Africa. This part of the continent has been made into an island onto itself, hypothetically cut off from the mainly affluent Berber and Arab north and from the white-driven industrialized South Africa, at the other extreme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Search for sub-Sahara in a data base and the array of words such as AIDS, wars, famine, genocide, debt, dictatorship, among others, pop up with some kind of uncanny rhythm, more than enough to discourage the interaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African problems, many of them man-made, have seemed so overwhelming that the African scholar, Ali Mazrui, once urged a &quot;benign colonization&quot; of trouble torn states by the more stable ones on the continent, as a possible remedy. He was barked down by furious and frustrated colleagues for uttering what they considered to be an abomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Nettleford said black peoples the world over faced more or less the same problems. Conflict, poverty and disease are intertwined. They emanate from the neocolonial situation, he said, citing ongoing political and social problems in Nigeria, as a case in point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Whatever crises there are in some African countries now, should not lead us to give up hope,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States and European countries went through much more difficult times, before emerging as great powers today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Therefore, it would amount to some kind of arrogance on the part of Africans to think they are so different from other people that they won't make mistakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nettleford, who has been to several African countries, also took issue with outsiders who think they have been ordained by nature to &quot;teach&quot; Africans how to go about just everything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have often had to remind people in the United States and other places who like to hold tutorials for other nations that they did not do too well for up to 90 years after their independence,&quot; he said. But this does not mean that Africans should not condemn evil and wrong doings in their countries.  Meanwhile, Africans and those in the diaspora, especially intellectuals, should engage in constant networking on how to improve their lot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If Africa does not remain important to us ourselves, it won't be to anybody,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This sounds like a dire message to African leaders now in Yaounde, Cameroon, for the annual Summit of the 33-year-old Organisation of African Unity, the body that supplanted Kwame Nkrumah's United States of Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> YAOUNDE, Cameroon (PANA) - The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) is seriously considering calling for the imposition of severe international sanctions against war-torn Liberia and the setting up of a war crimes tribunal against the leadership of the country's warring factions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The O.A.U. Council of Ministers meeting in Yaounde, the Cameroonian capital, has proposed a resolution recommending the non-recognition of any Liberian government which comes into office through the use of force or violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberia, Africa's oldest republic, has been ravaged by a brutal civil war since 1989, which has spawned a frightening refugee crisis as several warring factions wreak mayhem and destruction on the west African nation of 2.5 million people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If approved by the heads of state and government at their 32nd ordinary conference from July 8 to 10, the resolution will also give teeth to the West African Peace-Monitoring Force (ECOMOG), changing its mandate from peace-keeping to peace-enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The resolution sends a strong message to Liberian faction leaders such as Charles Taylor, Roosevelt Johnson and Alhaji Kromah, warning them that should the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) assessment of the peace process turn out to be negative, the O.A.U. would help sponsor a draft resolution in the United Nations Security Council for the imposition of severe sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This will include the possibility of setting up a war crimes tribunal similar to the one on the Rwanda genocide, to try the leadership of the factions on the violation of the human rights of innocent civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The resolution also calls on the warring factions to return all items looted from the capital, Monrovia, during the recent round of fighting in April to their rightful owners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It urges the international community to scrupulously comply with the arms embargo imposed on the warring factions by the U.N. Security Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Burundi, the ministers, also proposed a resolution expressing &quot;very serious&quot; concern on the &quot;very unstable&quot;, tense and politically polarized situation that continued to prevail in a nation torn apart by ethnic fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The resolution entrusts the central organ of the O.A.U. on conflict prevention and management to pursue its efforts to prevent a further deterioration of the situation in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 150,000 people have been killed in the past three years in clashes between the majority, but underclass Hutus and the minority but economically powerful Tutsis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The resolution also requests the Secretary-General of the O.A.U., Salim Ahmed Salim, to persevere in his efforts to find a lasting solution to the conflict in Burundi and to report to the next session of the council of ministers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials at the Nigerian presidency said the talks covered bilateral and regional issues. Capt. Jammeh is on a two-day state visit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gambia and Nigeria belong to the 16-nation Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, according to Nigerian military sources, Gambia has asked for a renewal of a military cooperation agreement with Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria has helped the tiny West African state train its army. The Jammeh administration suspended the programme when it seized power on July 22, 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Military sources said the Gambian authorities had asked for the return of Nigerian instructors to Banjul, to boost the professionalism and quality of their army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria's director of defence information, Brig.-Gen. Fred Chijuka, said the Gambian request was being studied by the Nigerian government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - The trial of eight Zambian opposition leaders accused of treason, was adjourned by the magistrate's court here, on Thursday, after the prosecution failed to produce the case file.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The magistrate, Francis Nsokolo, adjourned the case for mention until July 18, for lack of a file specifying the charges against the politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nsokolo also said the court would carry out preliminary inquiry on the conduct of the Director of Public Prosecutions, if he fails to submit the case file in two weeks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nsokolo was reacting to a submission by a senior defence counsel, Edward Shawana, that the court should have initiated a probe on why the prosecution did not commit the accused for trial in the high court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the High Court will Friday, rule on the habeas corpus application filed by the accused last week, challenging the legality of their continued detention without trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The eight, all leading members of former President Kenneth Kaunda's United National Independence Party (UNIP), were arrested early June and charged with four counts of treason, in connection with bomb explosions in parts of the country claimed by a group which calls itself the &quot;Black Mamba.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defence lawyers urged the high court presided by Justice Peter Chitengi, that the men be set free since the state appeared to have no evidence to try the suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A state counsel, Teddy Nondo, said that he had personally seen the director of prosecution who confirmed receipt of the case file, saying he was studying the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, police Thursday, turned away UNIP supporters in the court premises. This was to prevent a repetition of the pandemonium which broke out during the last two court sessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shawana had earlier appealed to the magistrate to tell the police that they had no powers to stop, harass or intimidate citizens who wanted to hear the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nsokolo agreed with the defence lawyer that people must be accorded an opportunity to hear the case since the matter was not being held in camera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the accused is UNIP deputy leader, Senior Chief Inyambo Yeta, who did not appear in court Thursday, because he has been admitted to a private hospital here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yeta fell sick last week while in court, after reportedly drinking some water. Medical authorities at the hospital have denied speculations that he could have been poisoned by some people in the court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria has the largest continent in ECOMOG's estimated 10,500-strong force.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A military spokesman said in Lagos Thursday, the troops, who left Lagos for Monrovia Wednesday, would take over from those who have concluded their tour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They left in a Nigerian naval ship, NNS Ambe, which brought home some 1,400 displaced Nigerians from Monrovia two weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Commander of Nigeria's Western Naval Command, Commodore Ibrahim Magole, urged the soldiers before their departure to be &quot;loyal, dedicated and good ambassadors&quot; of the country in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ECOMOG, now under the command of Nigeria's Maj.Gen. John Inienger, was originally sent to Monrovia in August 1990, by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), to try and stop factional fighting in Africa's first republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The war begun Dec. 24, 1989, in form of a rebellion by Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) against the government of late President Samuel Doe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Doe was killed in September 1990, by Taylor's former ally-turned-foe, Prince Yormie Johnson, now an exile in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In spite of ceaseless peace efforts by the ECOWAS and the international community, the six-year-old war, which has claimed some 150,000 lives, has continued in Liberia, founded in 1847 by freed slaves from the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers blame the warlords for the continuation of the senseless war, which has also made refugees of about half of Liberia's 2.5 million population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Renewed hostilities among the factions erupted April 6, resulting in the evacuation of foreigners and further attempts by more Liberians to flee their devastated country.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEW YORK, United Nations (PANA) - Morocco has accused President Rawlings of Ghana, in his capacity as chairman of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), of bias and negative intentions in asking the United Nations to revive its involvement in Western Sahara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a letter to the Security Council in June, Rawlings reportedly urged the UN to reconsider its temporary suspension of its settlement plan for the former Spanish colony of Western Sahara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reacting to the letter, the Moroccan prime minister, Abdellatif Filali, said in a letter to the council that &quot;the concerns of Mr. Rawlings regarding peace in the region are a poor disguise of his relentless animosity towards Morocco.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Filali, who is also his country's foreign affairs and cooperation minister, accused the ECOWAS chairman of perpetrating &quot;political skid&quot; by acting without the knowledge of the members of the sub-regional organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Judging from the reaction of the countries concerned, it is now an established fact that the latest developments of the Sahara question were not discussed at any ECOWAS meeting,&quot; he said, adding that ECOWAS the member countries had dissociated themselves from the action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Filali said that instead of interfering in the issue, the ECOWAS chairman should &quot;save his energies...for the settlement of the tragedy that has long affected his sub-region.&quot; He was referring to the six-year-old civil war in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Security Council, saying that Morocco and the Polisario Front lacked the will to implement the settlement plan, voted on May 29, to suspend the identification of potential voters in a proposed self-determination referendum for the former Spanish colony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also decided to reduce the strength of the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The identification process, which is far behind schedule, is aimed at determining who is eligible to vote in a long-overdue referendum on the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the 1980s, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) recognized the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), which was proclaimed by the Polisario Front. This prompted Morocco to withdraw from the continental organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three ECOWAS members, including Ghana and Nigeria, have observers in MINURSO, whose strength is being reduced from 288 to 230.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Senegal says it has nothing to do with the appeal by the ECOWAS urging the UN to maintain its involvement in Western Sahara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Although it is a full member of ECOWAS, the Republic of Senegal was never consulted on the initiative that culminated in the letter...from the current chairman of ECOWAS to the president of the Security Council&quot; concerning Western Sahara, Senegal's ambassador to the UN, Ibra Deguene Ka, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senegal's action is the latest in the controversy generated by Rawlings' letter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is the opinion expressed in a white paper on Development and Promotion of Tourism in South Africa, released recently.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dawie de Villiers, until this week Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism in the Government of National Unity, said tourism currently contributes four percent to South Africa's GDP. &quot;This is well under the world average,&quot; he said, &quot;and nowhere close to the percentage of countries with well-organized tourism industries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The white paper stipulates the key policies required to lift tourism to the desired levels, and says an implementation strategy to reach these objectives is now being prepared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This strategy will also contain details regarding projects and target dates, and is planned to be completed by September 1996,&quot; said de villiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He pointed out that some critical programmes, such as training and safety and security, were already being addressed, but said that full scale implementation of the new strategy would start only toward the end of this year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> YAOUNDE, Cameroon (PANA) - The Organization of African Unity mission in strife-torn Burundi would not be able to avoid or contain a tragedy if one erupted there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a report to the Council of Ministers meeting, opening here Thursday, OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim says the political and security situation in Burundi has deteriorated dramatically in the last few months and is &quot;extremely tense and volatile&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Given the prevailing political and security situation, I am becoming increasingly convinced that the (OAU) mission, as presently constituted, is not in a position to avoid or contain a tragedy in that country if it were to erupt,&quot; Salim reports.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The OAU has a 47-member military observer mission in Burundi. Its mandate is to help restore peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mission has found it increasingly difficult to operate as the security situation in the country degenerates. In some cases &quot;even the safety and security of the OAU military observers has become a matter of serious attention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The OAU should be prepared to redefine the mandate, size and composition of its mission in Burundi, Salim suggests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In doing so we might consider a variety of options, including the option of withdrawing the military component of the mission and only maintain an OAU presence at the political level to monitor developments and assist as and when the need arises.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Salim, however, suggests to the council that &quot;for the present our mission should continue with its activities despite the difficulties,&quot; as one way of backing the initiatives of Tanzania's former president Julius Nyerere for peace in that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The crisis in Burundi begun when fighting broke out between the Hutu majority and Tutsi minority after the democratically elected Hutu president, Melchior Ndadaye, was killed by Tutsi soldiers in an abortive military coup in October 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fighting between Hutu militias and the Tutsi dominated army has forced thousands of civilians to flee the capital, Bujumbura, and led to much destruction of life and property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Several thousand university students in Bujumbura on Thursday, demonstrated against proposals to send a regional peacekeeping force into Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The proposal was made last week at a regional summit in Arusha, northern Tanzania, on the ethnic conflict in the central African state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The students, from Burundi's only university, demanded the resignation of the president, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, saying he had plans to dismantle the regular army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The demonstrators carried banners that read: &quot;Foreign Military Intervention in Burundi Equals Dismantling the Army&quot;, &quot;We Demand Conscription of the Youth into the Army&quot;, or &quot;The Regime in Power Must Fall&quot;, &quot;We Want New Men to Lead the Country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The army is dominated by the minority Tutsi who are pitted against the majority Hutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The current president, Ntibantunganya, is Hutu although his cabinet includes some Tutsi ministers, including the prime minister, Antoine Nduwayo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The six neighboring states -- Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania and Zaire -- that attended the Arusha meeting on June 25, plan to send a peacekeeping force to Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Tutsi opposition, led by the Unity for National Progress (UPRONA), formerly the sole party, is also strongly opposed to any foreign military intervention in the country's crisis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - A statement issued by the Investigation Coordination Department of the Police Force Central Bureau said police has foiled the conspiracy of a clandestine organization to assassinate high government officials, renowned individuals and foreigners especially American citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The alleged members of the illegal, underground organization including its chairman Dr. Taye Wolde-Semayat and deputy chairman and economic affairs head Seleshi Berhane as well as other members have been put under police custody following the abortive attempt, the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said rather than organizing peacefully and carrying out legal and peaceful political work, the illegal organization has been undertaking until early 1995 extensive activity following the insurrectionist path to establish an underground organization initially under the name &quot;Ethiopian Unity Patriots Front&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following is the full text of the statement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, every citizen has the right to subscribe to the political view of his choice, to organize freely and in accordance with the law and regulations to move throughout the country to mobilize supporters and to protest in a peaceful manner. This right has been exercised in full since the beginning of the transition period when it was inscribed in the Charter. This right is respected today with a greater constitutional guarantee following the adoption of the Constitution which was produced with the participation of all the peoples of our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whereas the democratic rights of citizens and peoples are constitutionally guaranteed, their implementation can only succeed when all citizens exercise their rights in a lawful and orderly manner. The fact that during the transition period and since then, political parties were established and succeeded in functioning legally, and that citizens began to extensively exercise their democratic rights is a proof of this reality. As has been seen to date, all measures taken by the government, from ensuring peace and stability to the establishment of democratic structures to promote the exercise of democratic rights emanate from the Government's desire to provide proper legal protection for the democratic activities of citizens and political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the activities of political parties that are carried out in a peaceful and lawful manner need to be protected and encouraged, it is the duty and responsibility of the law enforcement bodies of the government to protect against illegal activities aimed at destroying by force the peaceful and democratic order achieved through sacrifice, and to take legal action if such activity has indeed taken place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this regard, the Investigation Coordinating Department of the Police Force Central Bureau has began a legal investigation into an illegal organization that is bent disrupting the peace of the land, destabilizing the democratic process and furthermore fomenting disorder and terror. As soon as the investigations initiated by the department are complete, the matter will be brought to the attention of the relevant bodies for their decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The matter that is being examined by the Investigation Coordination Department of the Police Force Central Bureau is the following. As referred to earlier, rather than organize peacefully and carry out legal and peaceful political work, until early 1995 extensive activity has been undertaken following the insurrectionist path to establish an underground organization initially under the name &quot; &quot;Ethiopian Unity Patriots Front&quot; and a short time later under the name &quot;Ethiopian National Patriots Front&quot;. Among those that initiated and organized this movement are included:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Dr. Taye Woldesemayat</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Ato Sileshi Berhane and three other collaborators</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These persons and their collaborators who chose to embark on this illegal and destructive path carried out secret meetings in Addis Ababa and after elaborating the organization's programme, elected among themselves Dr.  Taye Woldesemayat as Chairman, Ato Sileshi Berhane as Deputy and responsible for Economic Affairs, and other for military responsibilities. Following a plan to implement the programme of their underground organization, they took various measures giving priority to identifying sources of income, securing weapons and recruiting former military officers to carry out military duties.  Accordingly,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Regarding sources of Income:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The organization, for financing its illegal activities has decided to follow the method of forcing people especially wealthy individuals to pay contribution as well as robbing, by forceful means, governmental and private business institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Regarding Arms:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In order to fulfill the plans of the organization the first option was to collect arms through purchase and in this regard a launcher and an Uzi rifle with their ordinances were captured. Moreover, to carryout their activities they have stockpiled different types of armaments in Eastern Gojjam where they were captured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Recruitment:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As indicated above, in order to increase its source of income through robbery and to be able to use the arms that were acquired former army officers -- namely Captain Moges Assefa, Lieutenant Chane Tolla Teffera and Dagne (Targeta Leuel) -- were recruited and issued weapons. The Ethiopian National Patriotic Front, as it was initially established in a clandestine manner, conspired and planned to carry out terrorist activity especially in Addis Ababa to augment its income through robbery, to assassinate high government officials and renowned individuals as well as foreigners and especially American citizens. This conspiracy was foiled before it was executed and Sileshi Berhane escaped arrest while Lieutenant Chane Tolla Teffera was arrested after an encounter with security officers and after causing a slight injury on a policeman with the rifle issued to him by the organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others are under detention pending investigation of their case in accordance with the criminal code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In connection with this clandestine plot, Gebre Tsadik Haile Mariam, the person who was involved as a coordinator, liaison man and organizer was apprehended concealing an Uzi rifle and numerous bullets. He is currently under investigation along with his accomplices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the results of the investigation obtained so far, Gebre Tsadik Haile Mariam has deployed in 1987 Ethiopian calendar a team of this illegal organization to throw grenades on the premises of the American Government Aid Agency USAID, located near the Bole Road. Moreover it has also been ascertained that in 1985 Ethiopian calendar an attempt was carried out to murder an American employee of the USAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Department of Investigation Coordination of the Central Police will submit, through the Federal Attorney's Office the case to the appropriate court as soon as the investigation on the alleged criminals is completed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - Ethiopia as a sovereign state has the right to harness rivers in her territory and has begun activities to develop the Nile basin with an outlay of 50 million birr, a senior government official announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ato Shiferaw Jarso, Minister of Water Resources, in an interview with Ifoyita, a private magazine, said the agreement reaches between Egypt and Sudan to share the annual water flow of the Nile River in 1959 without consulting the Upper Valley countries will not be implemented in countries like Ethiopia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Without exploiting Nile, which accounts for half of the country's water resource, it is virtually impossible to overcome famine and be self -sufficient in food he noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The minister said Ethiopia's stand to use the Nile equality and in common has the backing of international law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The accord reached in Helsinki, Finland, on the use of River Nile in 1966, has provisions for balanced and equitable utilization he said, adding this has given Ethiopia a legal ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Egypt and Sudan have been preoccupied for long in propagating the idea that Upper Valley countries should not use the river for they receive sufficient rain water, he said, adding the right to equitable utilization, the idea Ethiopia adheres to, as won acknowledgment. There will be no negotiation other than this, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Small-scale irrigation projects are under way in Tigray, Amhara and Oromiya regional states to use the Nile River, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ethiopia gets 110.15 billion cubic meter of water from its rivers while the subterranean water resource is estimated at 2.5 billion cubic meter, the magazine said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nile basin, which covers 17 per cent of the area of the country, accounts for 52.62 billion cubic meter of the total water resource of the nation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> United Nations - If the peace process in Angola is to succeed, the parties, especially the Uniao Nacional para a Independencia Total de Angola (UNITA), must show greater readiness to implement, in good time, the commitments they have entered into, UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali notes in his report on the UN Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM III).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the report, submitted to the Security Council today, Dr. Boutros- Ghali says the pace of implementation of the Lusaka Protocol has somewhat improved during the last two months. &quot;The promulgation of the Amnesty Law, the completion of the quartering of the rapid reaction police, the partial withdrawal of Angolan Armed Forces (FAA) to barracks, some progress in the quartering of UNITA troops, and a small beginning to the incorporation of UNITA military personnel into FAA, are all positive factors,&quot; the report notes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On a cautionary note, the report says that the coming two weeks will be critical, noting that the parties have not fulfilled the time-frame agreed upon between President dos Santos and Dr. Savimbi during their meeting at Libreville on 1 March. &quot;Continuing delays in the quartering of UNITA troops, the high number of desertions from the quartering areas, the unsatisfactory quality and quantity of weapons and ammunition handed over, the failure to quarter UNITA police personnel and the incomplete withdrawal of FAA from forward positions all require urgent corrective action if the peace process is to retain credibility,&quot; the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recommending the extension of UNAVEM III mandate for three months until 11 October, the report states that UNAVEM III has become the UN's largest peace-keeping operation. &quot;As the February 1997 target for the completion of the UN peace-keeping operation in Angola is fast approaching, I have initiated contingency planning for the phased downsizing of its military component as soon as the quartering process has been successfully concluded and the incorporation of UNITA troops into FAA and the formation of the unified armed forces have reached an advanced stage,&quot; the report concludes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Government of the Republic of Angola (GRA)and representatives of the National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) signed the Lusaka Protocol, a comprehensive peace agreement, on November 20, 1994. The protocol called for a cease-fire, the quartering and disarming of UNITA troops, and the formation of a unified national army. In return for its demilitarization, UNITA would take part in a government of national reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On February 9, 1995, the United Nations (U.N.)Security Council authorized the establishment of a 7,500-member peacekeeping operation, the U.N. Angola Verification Mission III (UNAVEM III), to help guard the current peace agreement. On September 25-26, 1995, President dos Santos and UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi attended the U.N.-sponsored Angolan Roundtable Conference, held in Brussels, Belgium. During the conference, more than $1 billion was pledged by international donors toward a multi-year reconstruction program that included demobilization, mine clearance and awareness, rehabilitation of basic infrastructure, reintegration of war-displaced persons, community development, and a reduced humanitarian assistance program to aid the transition from emergency to development. On December 8, 1995, during his first official visit to the U.S., dos Santos met President Clinton.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For now, the success of Angolans' efforts to move from prostration to reconstruction depends on the reintegration of soldiers and their families into civilian life. Enduring tension between UNITA and GRA forces threaten to keep large parts of the country isolated, and therefore less capable of shaking off the ills produced by the long war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In recent months, however, came signs of greater efforts by both sides to live up to the Lusaka Protocol. On March 1, President dos Santos and Savimbi met in Libreville, Gabon, where they reiterated their commitment to the Lusaka Protocol and agreed to a timetable by the end of July, and to the subsequent formation of the Government of Unity and National Reconciliation.  On May 21, both sides reached agreement on the means for integrating UNITA troops into the Angolan Armed Forces (FAA). On June 3, a group of 15 UNITA officers were sworn into the FAA, with another 30 officers entering the FAA on June 15. As of June 25, 51,537 UNITA soldiers were registered in 14 U.N.-run quartering areas (QAs) On May 8, the Security Council extended the mandate until July 11, and called on both sides to complete the quartering of UNITA troops. Severe inflation and a moribund economy led President dos Santos to replace key government ministers on June 7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Numbers Affected</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The number of Angolans inside the country currently requiring external emergency assistance is estimated at 2.2 million, including internally displaced persons (IDPs) and demobilized soldiers and their families. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) also estimates that there are some 325,000 Angolan refugees in neighboring countries: 200,000 in Zaire; 96,000 in Zambia; 12,600 in the Congo; 1,600 in Namibia; and 15,000 in 32 other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Total U.S. Government (USG) Humanitarian Assistance FY 1996 (to date): $48,776,095.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Current Situation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1995, UNITA officials throughout Angola harassed humanitarian relief workers and denied them clearance for flights and road convoys. Several organizations suspended relief activities in December 1995 for security reasons, but most resumed operations in January 1996. The opening of roads for peacekeeping and humanitarian purposes has been hindered by thousands of unexploded mines, numerous destroyed bridges, and a lack of security in many parts of the countryside. Nonetheless, access throughout the country has gradually increased, and new pockets of needy populations continue to be identified. IDPs in some provinces have slowly begun to return home, and targeted assistance programs have been shifted to help them rebuild their lives. Banditry, landmines, and general insecurity have nevertheless deterred many IDPs from returning home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.N., non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the GRA and UNITA are all working to reopen the country by improving roads and implementing mine-clearing programs. The Central Mine Action Office of the U.N. (CMAO) estimates that there are 10 million landmines in Angola. The country suffers from one of the world's highest per-capita rates of mine accidents, which have left an estimated 70,000 civilian and soldier amputees. CMAO works closely with the GRA's Mine Action Institute (INAROE) as well as with international NGOs to conduct de-mining and mine-awareness activities. USAID supports the mine-awareness and de-mining activities of four NGOs and provides technical assistance to CMAO. Some budding commerce, free movement of people, and reconstruction have resumed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Winter rains ceased temporarily in January, damaging some crops, such as corn. Pockets of malnutrition continue to appear. Early this year emergency food interventions followed a report in December 1995 by the World Food Program (WFP), World Vision Relief and Development (WVRD), and Action Contre la Faim (ACF) of high levels of malnutrition in Gonguembo, Kwanza Norte Province and in Cusse, Huila Province. A joint WFP-GRA-UNITA team also reported alarmingly poor nutrition levels in Likua, Cuando Cubango Province.  A survey by CARE in April showed malnutrition in the area around Quilengues and Catala, Huila Province, resulting from physical isolation imposed by the political/military situation, poor rainfall, and theft. CARE and WFP undertook feeding programs to overcome malnutrition in the communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political/Military Situation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although fighting officially ceased with the signing of the Lusaka Protocol, decades of accumulated hostility and mistrust set the stage for subsequent cease-fire violations. More than 500 U.N. observers are currently stationed in 50 sites throughout the country to monitor such violations, and an additional 5,800 UNAVEM III troops are acting as a further buffer to deter skirmishes. Despite many cease-fire violations in late 1995, efforts by both sides in early 1996 have enabled the peace process to progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Together, UNITA and the GRA have released more than 500 prisoners of war since November 1994. In accordance with the Lusaka Protocol, the GRA has begun to barrack its para-military Rapid Intervention Police. The two sides have formally agreed to military integration provisions, including ways of merging UNITA forces into the FAA, and for demobilizing excess manpower from both sides to create a unified army of 26,000 former GRA soldiers and 26,000 former UNITA fighters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As stated in the peace agreement, QAs have been erected throughout Angola for the registration and disarmament of UNITA soldiers under U.N.  supervision. To date there are 14 QAs. Likua QA, Cuando Cubango Province, opened in early June. In mid-May, Savimbi promised to have 50,000 UNITA troops in QAs by June 15, and 60,000 by July. As of June 25, 51,537 UNITA personnel had registered, although desertions reduced the total by 4,849.  With them came 56,085 dependents. Days before the June 15 deadline, UNITA delivered enough troops to the QAs to satisfy UNAVEM officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Security Situation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although a recent increase in the numbers of UNITA soldiers registering at QAs points to progress in demobilization, the enduring presence of military checkpoints and unrecovered land mines have prevented thousands of IDPs from returning to their homes. Lawlessness prevails throughout most of the country. On April 3, two UNAVEM officers and the deputy representative of OXFAM were murdered by unknown gunmen on the road between Cubal and Lobito in Benguela Province. Aid convoys on the road were consequently suspended for a week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - An international law expert last Saturday explained the supposed &quot;interference&quot; of donors in Zambia's affairs, urging the government to closely examine its international affiliations with a view to understanding them better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Citing the problem posed by the attempt of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to intercede in Zambia's affairs, Michelo Hansungule, an international law expert and University of Zambia Law School lecturer, said Zambia as an independent state which had voluntarily joined international organis- ations was bound by law to follow their regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said &quot; the international personality of a country and therefore its sovereignty is affected by the membership of the state in an organisation or agency&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Article Four of the SADC treaty provides that its member states shall act in accordance with the following principles; sovereign equality of all member states; solidarity, peace, and security; human rights, democracy, and the rule of law; etc,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But ruling MMD national secretary, minister without portfolio Michael Sata, who participated in the debate on The implication of donor aid on the democratic process, organised by the Legal Resources Foundation, said the government had not erred in any way and demanded that Hansungule cite specific areas where it had gone wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is no crisis in the country,&quot; Sata maintained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But UNIP secretary general Sebastian Zulu insisted that the government had breached all the aid conditions demanded by donors including democratic governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Zambia and other governments receiving aid are currently accountable to the donor community for the money donated to show how it has been spent. This has been the only real accountability in societies in which there has been no democratic control. It is important that this accountability included political questions and in particular that it was tied to progress in democracy, human rights, and the rule of law until such time that democratic institutions and attitudes had developed to the extent that the local aid recipient society can bring their government to account,&quot; Hansungule explained.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Zambia Democratic Congress National Secretary Derrick Chitala has called on President Chiluba not to undermine Zambia as a legitimate state in the SADC region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The tragedy for Zambia is that President Chiluba has undermined the legitimacy of our government. That is why not a single neighbour agreed to come and open this year's Zambia International Trade Fair (ZITF),&quot; said Chitala.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But opening the ZITF last Saturday, President Chiluba did not comment on the low participation of the international community but encouraged Zambians to look forward to a bright future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The whole structure of the economy has changed in the last five years...Goods are now available on the market, the infrastructure is improved, the roads, hospitals, and schools, have been improved,&quot; said the President who explained that this was due to the on-going privatisation programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Supporting the President, ruling MMD national secretary, Minister Without Portfolio Michael Sata, said yesterday it was not mandatory for the President to attend every meeting in person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is enough that Zambia was represented at the SADC meeting. That is the purpose of representatives and missions abroad, to cover for the President,&quot; said Sata who dismissed Chitala's claims &quot;as nonsense&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZITF chairman Leonard Kafunda was, however, disappointed with the non-appearance of South Africa, Zimbabwe, and India who he said had confirmed but failed to show up at the last minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I would like to appeal to exhibitors to avoid last-minute pull-outs and appeal to countries in the region and beyond to take advantage of the trade fair,&quot; Kafunda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He urged the government to work closely with business organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some government sources revealed that President Ketumile Masire of Botswana had been invited to open this year's fair but had declined due to last Friday's SADC meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Chitala said the near boycott of the Zambian trade fair was just one sign, among many, that the international community was not pleased with what was happening in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What Chiluba should know is that the cold war is over and no despot can find peace in either East or West. We only have one world of democracy, and if Chiluba continues to subvert democracy in the manner he has done this one world will find him and he'll be crushed,&quot; Chitala warned. &quot;His defence of sovereignty is false and he is transforming our country into a pariah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Mozambique President Joachim Chissano told the Zimbabwean Sunday Mail newspaper after the SADC meeting that he did not approve of the current amended constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;...I cannot approve of what has been done...had matters been thought over differently, animosity would have been avoided and perhaps the prestige of the man who is thought of as the father of the Zambian nation would have been protected,&quot; he reportedly said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is the toughest group among all the groups, we really have to work hard just from the beginning because we are in a tough group,&quot; Phiri said in an interview at Sunset Stadium yesterday during a league match between Zanaco and Power Dynamos.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - Following is the prepared testimony by former U.S.  Ambassador to Liberia James K. Bishop for the U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Africa. Bishop also served as deputy assistant secretary of State for human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank you for the opportunity to appear before the Committee today. The plight of the Liberian people has received too little attention in Washington. The Committee's initiative is most welcome by those who want to see the U.S. government act more vigorously to assist the Liberian people in their hour of extreme need.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is not necessary to remind members of this committee that Liberia was established as a nation by Americans, freed from slavery in this country. The special relationship between the two countries dates from the time of American settlement 175 years ago. Given the disparity in size and wealth is it not surprising that Liberians have set greater store in this relationship than have Americans. But it is disappointing that the United States government, which was able to take Liberia's support for granted when American security was threatened, has responded so hesitantly to the desperate pleas of Liberians caught up in a conflict brought on in part by their friendship for the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During two world wars which presented little threat to their national interests Liberians formally allied themselves with the United States. In the latter conflict rubber from Liberia was among the critical inputs enabling America to become the arsenal of democracy. Airfields and port facilities the U.S. military were permitted to construct on Liberian soil became stepping stones for the supply of allied forces fighting the Nazis in North Africa and Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the onset of the Cold War Liberians again put their security at risk to assist the United States. Permission was given to build extensive communications, navigation and information installations which almost certainly put Liberia on our global adversary's target list. Unrestricted U.S. military access to the country's international airport facilitated resupply of forces sympathetic to the United States in the proxy wars waged in Africa between the United States and its adversaries. Diplomatically the Liberians joined the United States in contesting the efforts of the Soviets and their allies to extend their influence throughout newly independent Africa. Whether it was recognizing Israel or expelling the Libyans, the United States could count on Liberia for consistent support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conflict which has transformed more than half of Liberia's population into refugees or internally displaced persons while killing over 150,000 of their number began as a Libyan-backed incursion. Charles Taylor's forces received arms and training from both the Libyans and Libyan surrogates in Burkina Faso. This targeting by the Libyan government was intended, I believe, as revenge for Liberia's outspoken opposition to Libyan aggression and subversion in Africa. Still smarting from the U.S. Air Force raid on Tripoli, Qadhafi probably also saw an opportunity to avenge himself on Washington by threatening the security of the cluster of American strategic assets located in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite a mutual defense pact the atrocities committed by President Doe's troops as they responded to the incursion quite properly ruled out any U.S. military role defending the Liberian government Doe headed. But Washington's decision to disengage from diplomatic efforts to bring the conflict to a negotiated conclusion was an ominous sign. It soon became clear that the United States was going to seriously disappoint those Liberians who thought the special relationship would prompt Washington to make an effort to resolve their conflict at least as serious as that which Washington had engaged in to solve civil wars in African countries in which the United States had no historic interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As it became increasingly clear that the officials of the neighboring Ivory Coast were stoking the fires of civil war by permitting arms and other supplies for Taylor to transit their territory, there were no vigorous American protests. The Ivory Coast was on the Security Council and the U.S.  was not going to jeopardize Ivorian support for American objectives at the U.N., particularly after Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. So the arms continued to flow in. Soon Taylor was being allowed to export logs cut from the rain forest to earn the money to pay for the arms. The American government remained mute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An American naval flotilla was dispatched to Liberian waters to assist in the evacuation of Americans and foreigners. When the American embassy was threatened a few hundred Marines were sent ashore. But the pleas of Liberians that the Marines remaining on board be sent into Monrovia to chase the belligerents out of the capital before they destroyed it went unheeded.  Absent American leadership the United Nations Security Council took no step to dispatch peacekeepers. For the first time in the history of the United Nations that responsibility was left to a regional military coalition, a coalition formed by some of the world's poorest states, left to finance their peacekeepers without any United Nations support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the past six years the United States has substituted humanitarian assistance for the exercise of the political will necessary to resolve the Liberian conflict. It apparently has not been on the agenda for high-level meetings with the French government. Paris' long-standing antipathy to Nigerian leadership aspirations in West Africa has made it an important and not always helpful actor in the Liberian drama. Hesitation, wishful thinking and bureaucratic gridlock have inhibited American financial support for the peace accords negotiated by West African states. The most recent and promising of these was signed last August. Although American experience in Mozambique, Angola and in dealing with conflicts far removed from Africa should have made it obvious that substantial funds would have to be provided for retraining and resettlement programs for combatants, none had been set up when the war resumed in April. Half of the meager $10 million earmarked by the U.S. to support a peacekeeping force on which the West Africans have expended hundreds of millions of dollars still had not been committed by April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Liberian civil war has been grotesque. The faction leaders are war criminals as reprehensible and deserving of punishment as those indicted by the International War Crimes Tribunals. The Liberian people are their victims. They are powerless before the intoxicated boy soldiers conscripted by Taylor, Boley, Kromah and Johnson. It is the Liberian people we have let down. If we are not willing to use our professional military forces to protect them, at least we should not deny them the protection envisioned by the United Nations Charter their government signed as a founding member. If we cannot even muster the resolve necessary to do this for our Liberian allies, let us cobble together a policy which combines financial support for the West African peacekeepers with significant programs for retraining and reintegrating the combatants, international monitoring of Liberia's borders to inhibit arms inflows, a ban on imports of Liberian goods from territory controlled by the warlords, and assistance to Liberian civil society, so that it has a chance to become the foundation for the eventual construction of a democratic Liberia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - Following is a statement issued on June 28 by Glyn Davies, acting State Department spokesman, welcoming &quot;some important and long-awaited strides&quot; by Zaire in preparing for May 1997 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zaire has made some important and long-awaited strides in preparing for the elections envisaged under the transition to democracy launched over six yeas ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States congratulates Zaire for seating a National Elections Commission (NEC) earlier this year, and for the NEC's announcement of a concrete electoral calendar calling for national, legislative, and local elections beginning in May 1997. These encouraging developments have given new impetus to a democratic transition which had too long been mired in partisan squabbling among Zaire's political factions and legislative inertia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States believes that Zaire's political class and civil society must now work closely together to finish the enormous tasks which remain to prepare for elections. The High Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament must adopt an electoral law and move a draft constitution to a popular referendum. We hope that these documents will be finalized in consultation with civil society, in a spirit of openness and concern for the will of Zaire's people. We look forward to an atmosphere of free discourse which Zaire's citizenry may learn more about the electoral process and its eventual candidates. The United States will continue to monitor closely the evolution of the election process in Zaire.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - Following is the prepared testimony on Liberia by acting assistant secretary of State for African Affairs William H. Twaddell before the U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am pleased to report that the situation in Liberia has improved since Assistant Secretary Moose met with you in early May. The city of Monrovia has been relatively calm for one month. Some fighters of Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) and of Alhaji Kromah's United Liberation Movement for Democracy (ULIMO-K) have left the city or observe the &quot;no guns on the streets&quot; dictum of the West African Peacekeeping Force, ECOMOG. The standoff at the Barclay Training Center has been resolved with the fighters of Roosevelt Johnson's ULIMO-J having left the center unarmed.  ECOMOG is deployed throughout the city and is seizing arms caches and exerting its authority to keep the peace. A large majority of those made homeless by the fighting have returned to their homes, although many whose homes were destroyed remain in displaced persons centers, including about 4,500 persons in the Embassy's Greystone Compound. Some Liberians and others have sought ways to leave Liberia, including on boats. There is still augmented security at the Embassy, but evacuation flights have virtually ceased with the resumption of commercial air traffic into Monrovia on June 17.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Current Situation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States government is energetically pursuing the opportunity provided by relative restoration of calm in Monrovia to push for resumption of the peace process. Our strategy remains consistent with what we described to you in May. Its core elements include: increased support for ECOMOG; enhanced diplomatic efforts aimed at encouraging maintenance of the cease-fire and restoration of the Abuja peace process; and stepped-up pressure on the faction leaders to cooperate. As Secretary Moose said in May, we believe the Abuja Accord, which provides for an interim government, disarmament, demobilization, and the holding of free and fair elections, continues to be the best framework for a permanent solution. ECOMOG remains key to achieving this goal. The early August Summit of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) will be critical when the West African leaders measure the progress toward reestablishing the peace process and take decisions regarding their continued involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At this moment, Special Presidential Envoy for Liberia, Ambassador Dane Smith is in the region. Last week he consulted with European governments, to explore how we, in conjunction with our allies, can best work with the countries of the region to strengthen ECOMOG. Ambassador Smith is also exploring ways we can work with others to keep pressure on the faction leaders to participate in good faith in the peace process. We are convinced that the faction leaders must be made to see their interests are best served by the reestablishment of a functioning national government and the disarmament and demobilization of fighters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The last point, keeping pressure on faction leaders, is closely related to the timely topic we are here to discuss today. The ability of the faction leaders to find collaborators in the international community to whom to sell illicit Liberian commodities to provide the wherewithal to arms merchants to procure and deliver weapons and munitions, is at the core of the tragedy of this seemingly endless conflict. Breaking this vicious cycle is critical to ending the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Arms Trade</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A steady flow of arms and munitions to Liberia's warring factions has kept the Liberian conflict going for over six years. Our information about this trade is sketchy and full of gaps but does lead to some conclusions.  Almost all weapons currently reaching Liberia transit countries in the region rather than arrive directly in Liberia. Which country, depends on which faction is the intended recipient. Arms reaching Charles Taylor's NPFL most likely transit Burkina Faso and Cote d'Ivoire. Those destined for Alhaji Kromah's ULIMO-K are likely to pass through Guinea. Some of the Krahn factions have in the past received weapons from Nigeria via Nigerian troops in ECOMOG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Illicit cross-border trade in Africa is not uncommon because of porous borders. The extent to which arms transfers to Liberia reflect conscious national government policy of the countries is difficult to gauge. Clearly, corrupt local or national government officials and ethnic sympathies make it possible for such transfers to continue even in the face of official policy expressly forbidding them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the arms and ammunition reaching Liberian factions are purchased on the gray market through private dealers in various countries, primarily in Europe. The NPFL, ULIMO-K, and the LPC have been the primary recipients of illicit arms shipments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The international community has long discussed the critical importance of ending arms flows to the Liberian factions. A 1992 ECOWAS declaration called on all nations to stop arms transfers and restrict commercial activity with Liberia. Later that year, the United Nations Security Council imposed an international arms embargo on Liberia. When the United Nations agreed to send an observer mission to Liberia (UNOMIL), the mandate included responsibility for monitoring cross-border trade in an attempt to end illicit arms transfers. UNOMIL troops were deployed on the borders until fighting in September/October 1994 forced them to withdraw to Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Revenue Sources</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The steady supply of arms -- none of the factions keeps large inventories -- depends on a steady supply of money. The primary source of funds appears to be from the sale of commodities from Liberia's trove of natural resources, principally diamonds, timber, gold, and rubber. At present, Taylor and his current ally Alhaji Kromah control the most of the areas where these commodities are found, namely across the northern tier of the country and along the border with Cote d'Ivoire. Kromah's rival, ULIMO-J, had access to some diamond areas before being pushed out of Tubmanburg. A Florida political science professor, William Reno, wrote recently: &quot;The war has been as much a battle over commerce inside and beyond Liberia's borders as it has been a war for territory or control of the government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Publicly available trade statistics suggest the magnitude of revenue available to Liberia's faction leaders from commodity sales. From 1990 to 1994 Liberia's diamond exports averaged $300 million annually. During the same period, timber exports averaged $53 million annually, rubber exports, $27 million annually, and gold exports close to $1 million annually. Iron ore exported from 1990 to 1993 (none was taken out in 1994) averaged almost $41 million annually. Even taking into account the inevitable smuggling of some of these commodities, especially diamonds, discounts for trafficking in illegal products, and bribes for officials in countries these products transit, the sums of money available to faction leaders are still substantial. Charles Taylor, who has long controlled the most lucrative areas of the countryside, could have upwards of $75 million a year passing through his hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just as most of the arms entering Liberia transit neighboring countries, so the commodities whose profits pay for the arms transit neighboring countries en route to their final destinations. To a large extent, those destinations are in Europe. Trade records indicate that most Liberian-origin diamonds probably find their way to Belgium. Buyers in France and Malaysia are the primary customers for Liberian timber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another source of funds, notably since the Abuja Accord of August 1995 brought the faction leaders into the ruling Council of State, has been revenues from Liberia's maritime registry, which constitute 90 percent of the Liberian government's legitimate revenue. Following disbursement to the government last fall of ship registry revenue, there was a notable rise in foreign travel by Liberian faction leaders, especially those on the Council of State and their supporters, who travel with large entourages. Ship registry revenues are about $16-20 million annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Business Deals and the United States</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the United States is not believed to be a major source of arms for Liberia or a principal recipient of illicit Liberian commodities, it is fertile ground for activities that have contributed significantly to the coffers of Liberian faction leaders and have certainly helped prolong the war. Most of the Liberian faction leaders and their associates have spent many years in the U.S., often as students, temporary workers, even as permanent residents. They own property, own or operate businesses, and, more importantly, they know how the U.S. system works and how to make it work for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their activities fall into five major categories: direct fund-raising, investments, U.S. bank accounts, scams, and the sale of raw materials. The following examples are indicative:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- New Horizons, a group based in Providence, R.I., aggressively solicited funds for several years through a sophisticated newsletter and direct appeals via radio talk shows and personal appearances at Liberian-American events. In 1994, New Horizons raised over $2 million, some of which was used to finance the coup attempt of former Doe Lieutenant General Julue in September 1994. The group, which used to confine its activities to New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Maryland, conducted major fund-raising efforts in 1995 in California and Texas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Charles Taylor either owns or controls a tree service company in Maryland, a legitimate business which reportedly won a contract to provide all landscaping services to the City of Baltimore, thereby generating $2 million monthly to the business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- When negotiations seemed headed toward peace about a year ago, numerous wealthy businessmen in the U.S. reported contacts from certain Liberians and unsuspecting U.S. church leaders asking them to contribute to a dubious fund to rebuild Liberia. Monies contributed later disappeared.  Another scam offered commodity concessions or monopoly business opportunities in gold or diamonds in postwar Liberia at extremely favorable terms. We do not know how many hundreds of thousands of dollars may have been collected in these appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conclusion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All of this adds up to a grim picture: warlords wantonly exploiting their country's resources to keep themselves and their rag-tag forces in weapons with virtual international impunity and, in some cases, complicity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Administration is keenly interested in putting an end to the United States serving as a source of weapons or funds for faction leaders. However, curbing the generation and expatriation of funds, even when it is highly probable that they are fueling the Liberian war, is difficult as long as those involved comply with U.S. law. Fund-raising activities are not restricted and funds are easily spirited out of the country. Evidence of arms purchases in the United States, money-laundering, transportation of stolen merchandise, non-payment of taxes, or non-compliance with asset reporting requirements are easier to combat. But arms are not generally being purchased in the United States and most of the lucrative commodity trade is directed elsewhere. Even were commodities entering the United States, consider how difficult it would be to prove Liberian origin of timber, for example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nevertheless, we continue to seek ways to constrict these activities. As Ambassador Moose announced in May, the United States reimposed visa restrictions on the faction leaders and their close associates for impeding the peace process by renewing fighting in Monrovia in April. Discussions with European Union members have resulted in many of them agreeing to follow suit.  We are also exploring with our European allies the extent to which other measures might be imposed collectively on Liberian faction leaders if they fail to cooperate with restoration of the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. government firmly believes it is in the interest of all the people of Liberia to end exploitation of Liberia's riches for illicit benefit of a few to the detriment of the majority. With its rich natural resource base, Liberia has the potential to be a wealthy country. Not only is the plunder of Liberia's resources contributing to a continuation of warfare, it is depriving the people of Liberia and future generations of their rightful inheritance. We believe it is incumbent on all countries to ensure that the U.N. Arms Embargo against Liberia is not violated within its territory. We have called on its neighboring countries to adhere strictly to the U.N. arms embargo and several U.N. Security Council resolutions on Liberia have urged the international community as a whole to do the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have (urged) and will continue to urge countries aware of violations to bring them to the attention of the U.N. Sanctions Committee; only then is the U.N. obliged to investigate allegations. Both aspects should be tackled equally aggressively: the illicit commodity sales that provide the warlords wherewithal, and the mechanisms of arms purchase and delivery. States or individuals engaging in or turning a blind eye to either are perpetuating Liberia's tragic war and should have to answer for their acts before national and international laws.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> YAOUNDE, Cameroon (PANA) - The long-running civil war in Southern Sudan does not feature on the Agenda of the council of ministers of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), now scheduled to begin here Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Council will prepare for the Assembly of the OAU heads of state and government next week. The Summit is expected to focus on the problem of conflicts in the continent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The omission of the southern Sudan problem contrasts with the attention that is being given in the OAU Agenda to other rebellions against established governments in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These include conflict situations in Sierra Leone, Burundi, the armed infiltration by the army and militia of the former government in Rwanda and the defiance of Gen. Roosevelt Johnson of ULIMO-J of Liberia against the council of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The summit will also examine the government crisis in the Comoros and the tribulations of the peace process in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It will also focus on Somalia, where three is no central government and warlords are pitched against each other, Western Sahara, where a referendum for self determination has so far been hampered by difficulties in identifying voters, the territorial dispute between Eritrea and Yemen, and the dispute between Libya and the Britain, France and the United States, who have maintained sanctions against Tripoli over accusations of supporting terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But OAU spokesman, Ibrahim Dagash, told Journalists Tuesday, the civil war in Sudan, as well as the territorial dispute between Nigeria and Cameroon, which has also been omitted from the agenda, &quot;could come up during the heads of state meeting&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Sudan People's Liberation Army has been fighting a protracted guerrilla war against the Khartoum Government, to press demands for autonomy and the removal of &quot;sharia&quot; laws in Southern Sudan, which is predominantly christian and animist as opposed to the Arab Muslim north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The civil war, which started in 1983, has resulted in thousands of refugees and displaced persons and economic destruction, as well a straining of relations between Sudan and some of the neighboring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the civil war has been forgotten, Sudan, Africa's largest country, features prominently in the report of the OAU Secretary-General's report to the meeting -- in connection with the attempted assassination on President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt on June 26, 1995, soon after his arrival in Addis Ababa for an OAU Summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The incident, in which Sudan was accused of harboring three of the suspected would-be assassins, damaged relations between the country and Egypt as well as Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last March, OAU Secretary-General, Salim Ahmed Salim, visited Khartoum &quot;to demonstrate my personal concern and that of the OAU over the gravity of the problem arising from the attempted assassination of the President of Egypt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On May 10, the United Nations Security Council imposed a number of punitive measures against Sudan for not extraditing the three suspects and supporting terrorists and subversive groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sudan also features in Salim's report in connection with the presidential and legislative elections it held march 6-17. At the invitation of the Sudanese Government an OAU team monitored the elections which, it reported, were &quot;conducted peacefully&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - South Africa is to maintain its diplomatic ties with Taiwan for the moment, even though a break has been stipulated as a prerequisite for establishing diplomatic relations with Beijing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Confirming this Tuesday, South African President Nelson Mandela said he would make no such decision until China resolved what he referred to as &quot;an internal matter.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela, who is in direct contact with Taipei and Beijing over the sensitive issue of which China should be recognized by South Africa, pointed out that Taiwan and the People's Republic of China had supported the African National Congress in the war against apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said he could not be assisted by a country and then reject it once he came to power.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings has held talks with the Nigerian military leader, Sani Abacha, aimed at reviving the central role of the 16-nation Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Briefing the media on the talks, Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi said that for sometime now &quot;it seemed that ECOMOG has taken center stage and there was the need to re-define the central theme for which ECOWAS was established&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ECOMOG is the West African Peace Monitoring Force sent by the community to Liberia in 1990 at the height of the civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tuesday's talks, lasting four-and-a-half hours, were held behind closed doors. But officials said they were also aimed at furthering previous consultations, between the two countries, on the Liberian crisis and how best to harmonize their joint efforts at bringing lasting peace to that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ikimi said that Abacha had come to meet Rawlings since the Nigerian leader did not attend the Accra emergency meeting of the ECOWAS Committee of Nine on Liberia, after the upsurge of fighting April in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The talks also touched on the impending summits of the Organization of African Unity and of ECOWAS. He thanked the Ghana government for responding to the visit despite the short notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This express the cordial relationship that has transcended our various governments,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accompanying Abacha were the Minister of Information, Walter Ofonagoro and Wada Nas, Special Duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abacha, also met briefly Tuesday, with Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyedema.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Information was not immediately available on details of the talks held in Eyedema's home region of Kara, some 400 kilometres north of the Togolese capital, Lome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Togo, a co-founder with Nigeria, of the Economic Community of West African States, is mediating in Nigeria's dispute with Cameroon, a non-ECOWAS member, over ownership of the Bakassi Peninsula.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEW YORK, United Nations (PANA) - The Geneva-based United Nations Office for Outer Space, is to establish a satellite-based information network to link African scientists, educators, professionals and decision makers, according to an official of the agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chief of the space applications section of the office, Adigun Ade Abiodun, said in New York Tuesday the system, to be known as the Cooperative Information Network (COPIN), would encourage the use of space technology to improve health care and education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would also help efforts to protect Africa's natural resources and environment, he added.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adigun, speaking on a UN television programme, World Chronicle, said the network would be established with the support of some European countries and the European space agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would allow African experts in various fields to exchange information and conduct library research locally and globally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the decision to establish the network was taken in 1993 at Dakar, Senegal, at a conference organized to sensitize African countries to the uses of space technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At the conclusion of that particular conference, the participants implored us to please bridge the communication gap between and among African professionals, scientists, educators and decision-makers,&quot; said Abiodun, a Nigerian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Through this COPIN programme, which is really to be managed by the professionals and the universities, we hope that the opportunity will be created to enable what I call mass participation in this effort,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from COPIN, the UN specialized office is also planning to set up centers for space science and technology education in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiodun said the centers would be established in Nigeria, for the Anglophone African countries, and in Morocco for the Francophone countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Abiodun, &quot;the two countries are developing the necessary legal tools of agreement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the UN office plans another conference in South Africa in November, which Abiodun said was aimed at widening the use of the technology across Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conference is to be held with the support of the South African government and the European space agency providing financial assistance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report also shows that market capitalization hit 191.7 billion naira, up from to 171.1 billion in the previous three months. This represents a 12.1 percent rise.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brokers said new listings and strong (price) gains in the manufacturing sub-sector accounted for the growth.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the report said the gains during the quarter were moderated by losses in the banking and petroleum sub-sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oil shares suffered due to a slowdown caused by the scarcity of petroleum products while the banks have been experiencing difficulties as a result of distress in the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, turnover of shares traded last week was up on the previous week's figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some 25.9 million shares valued at 133.9 million naira were traded last week in 1,101 deals.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A glut of brewing and tobacco shares further depressed their prices.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - The white-dominated National Party of South African led by deputy president, Frederick de Klerk, pulled out of Nelson Mandela's government of national unity Monday, effectively losing its grip on power for the first time in half-a-century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NP now becomes the main official opposition to President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC), which won a majority in the first South African multi-racial polls in April 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NP, which won 20 percent of the votes in the elections, announced a few months ago that it was leaving the government because the ANC had refused to extend a power-sharing arrangement beyond the next election in 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Relinquishing his position as deputy president after 18 uninterrupted years in government, de Klerk claimed his party could be back in power sooner than his critics expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He predicted a change in the trend of voting along racial lines, saying &quot;I am confident that this fluid situation presents better opportunities for us, and that our time outside government will be much shorter than the experts might now believe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added that he expected to win support from millions of black people who have become disenchanted with the ANC. He also predicted that the National Party would have a black leader one day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The time will come,&quot; said de Klerk, &quot;when the overwhelming majority of those who vote for the National Party will be blacks, browns and Indians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the final analysis -- I don't know when -- there will be a black or a brown leader of the National Party standing before you,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEW YORK, United Nations (PANA) - Nigeria's military ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, has assured the United Nations of continuous progress in the country's transition to democracy programme and the release of detainees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abacha told a UN envoy, Lansana Kouyate, in Abuja on Thursday, that the current release of detainees (eight have been freed), would continue according to established procedures, a UN spokes person, Sylvana Foa, said in New York on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She told reporters that the Nigerian head of state gave the assurance while briefing Kouyate on the actions being taken by the government in response to the recommendations of the UN fact-finding mission which visited Nigeria from March 29 to April 13.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abacha also disclosed that commissions had been established to examine other recommendations made by the mission, the UN official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN Secretary-General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, despatched Kouyate to Nigeria as a follow-up to the report of the fact-finding mission, released last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Mr. Kouyate said that the secretary-general hoped that Nigerian authorities would proceed as quickly as possible to carry out the commitment in their interim response to the fact-finding mission's report,&quot; Foa added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In its response to the report, Nigeria said it would amend the Civil Disturbances Act, under which author Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others were tried and hanged in November last year, to exclude members of the armed forces. This is to ensure that verdicts reached under the decree could be appealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other measures contained in the response include the immediate review of the cases of persons being detained under certain decrees promulgated by the military government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the Nigerian leader was reported to have raised the problems of Liberia during his meeting with Kouyate, an assistance secretary-general in charge of political affairs in the world body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said though he was aware of the effort by the UN secretary-general to obtain additional resources for the sub-regional peace keeping force (ECOMOG), in Liberia, the operation still needed more support from the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigeria-led ECOMOG, along with a handful of UN observers, is saddled with overseeing the implementation of the Abuja peace accord, widely seen as the last-ditch attempt to end the six-year old Liberian civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kouyate, who has since left Nigeria, was also scheduled to visit other west African countries, to discuss the Liberian issue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> YAOUNDE, Cameroon (PANA) - Discussion of conflicts and disputes are expected to dominate the meeting of the Organization of African Unity Council of Miniters meeting, beginning in Yaounde, Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting will set the agenda for a three-day summit begininig next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The summit, an annual event in which heads of state and government meet to seek solutions to African problems, is also expected to deliberate on economic cooperation and integration.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African ambassadors began their two-day meeting Monday, in the Cameroonian capital, to prepare for the council of minisers meeting which is expected to end Saturday, one day before the start of the summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In keeping with its tradition, the summit will choose the host, Cameroon's President Paul Biya, as the new chairman of the 53-member continental body. Biya will take over from the incumbent, Ethiopia's President, Melez Zenawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The O.A.U. Secretary-General, Salim Ahmed Salim, in an interview broadcast Sunday by Radio Cameroon said the hotbeds of Africa and economic development will feature prominently in the summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the heads of state will, in closed sessions, talk frankly about the conflicts and disputes afflicting the continent and seek solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The organisation has changed in the last four years, Salim said, and the heads of state can be expected to go beyond passing declarations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Delegates, he said, will deliberate on what Africa could do about the conflicts and how to prevent them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa's flashpoints include Liberia and Somalia, where factional leaders and warlords have been fighting each other; Sierra Leone and Sudan, where rebel movements are at war with the governments, and Rwanda and Burundi, where ethnic fighting has created instability in the Great Lakes region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Morocco's claim over Western Sahara, or the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, and the territorial dispute between Cameroon and Nigeria over the Bakassi Peninsula, would also feature at the summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conflicts have resulted in seven millions refugees and 15 million displaced people, according to 1995 figures. They have also led to widescale destruction of property and disruption of economic activities in many countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Yaounde has braced itself to receive some 2,000 delegates and observers expected in the Cameroonian capital for the O.A.U. meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are ready to receive heads of state and delegates of all the 53 countries of the O.A.U., the general manager of the Yaounde Conference Centre, Ndifontah Nyamndi, told PANA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The centre, built in 1982 with a four-billion-franc grant (about eight million U.S. dollars) from China, is the summit venue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is be the second time Cameroon is hosting the summit. The first was in 1974.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe is reported to have publicly snubbed South African Vice-President Thabo Mbeki, when both of them met last week at a conference on attracting private investment to Africa, the Star newspaper reported at the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Johannesburg daily said &quot;Mugabe could not bring himself to speak a word to South Africa's Deputy President Thabo Mbeki on Wednesday night, although the two were seated next to each other at a dinner in Accra, hosted by Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said that Mugabe sat between Rawlings and Mbeki on the dais. &quot;When toasts were offered, Mugabe clinked glasses with Rawlings. Mbeki reached across and touched glasses with Rawlings, but Mugabe stared straight ahead and would not toast with Mbeki,&quot; it added.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Mugabe's coldness to Mbeki,&quot; it said, &quot;stood in stark contrast to the otherwise cordial, light-hearted summit on how to attract private investment to Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Meanwhile, Mugabe stared conspicuously straight ahead as if Mbeki were not there. Mugabe frequently turned to his left to try and engage Rawlings but never looked to his right to Mbeki,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When Rawlings left the table for 20 minutes Mugabe stared straight ahead, never uttering a word to Mbeki who talked freely with other guests,&quot; the newspaper said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At the dinner's end, Mugabe shook hands with Rawlings, then walked past Mbeki without a word or handshake,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report suggested that Mugabe's slights stemmed from deep jealousy.  He was once the centre of attention among the frontline states but has now lost the spotlight to Mbeki and President Nelson Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Strained trade relations may have also helped sour relations between the two countries and their leaders, the report added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But when contacted by the newspaper, Mbeki denied having been snubbed by Mugabe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A spokesman for the deputy president said the report contained factual inaccuracies and was based on groundless assumptions. &quot;The report was based on assumptions and observations made with insufficient information and no concrete evidence,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MAPUTO, (PANA) - Mozambique's policy of charging heavy fees for entry visas has drawn swift retaliation from South Africa. From Monday, Mozambicans will find that South African visas are no longer free of charge.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A notice published Sunday by the South African High Commission in Maputo, warns that starting July 1, each visa request must be accompanied by a fee of 30 U.S. dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This charge, the high commission says, is being imposed on citizens of all countries who charge South African nationals for entry visas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African has tried, repeatedly but without success, to persuade the Mozambican immigration authorities to reduce the chrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa is the most important destination for Mozambicans travelling abroad. The High Commission makes no mention of any possibility of paying the new charge in Mozambican currency, the metical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So, if Mozambicans continue to flock to South Africa, this will drain thousands of dollars in hard currency from Mozambique to South Africa every week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On paper, members of the 12-nation Southern African Development Community are supposed to be advancing toward the free movement of persons and goods throughout the region. In practice, as the latest measure shows, barriers are going up, not coming down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A similar visa-free provision within the 16-member Economic Community of West African States has been operating for years and successfully. This community also issues a common travel document valid within the region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) - Gulf Petroleum Sudan Company Ltd has said oil production at the Adar Yiel field in the country's Upper Nile area, would commence at the end of July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Secretary in charge of oil prospection, Gen. Salah Wahbi, told a local daily newspaper at the week-end that three oil wells in the area will begin lifting the crude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wahbi told the Al-Ingaz Al-Watan daily, Sunday, that the Adar Yiel field held some 170 million barrels of crude. Up to 60 million barrels of this amount can be drilled by using the conventional methods.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said at the experimental stage the field will be producing 5,000 barrels of crude per day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sudan, he said, was negotiating with five foreign companies for oil prospecting in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said another five companies have been prospecting since 1993 in the Higlig field in western Sudan, in association with the state-run petroleum company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The field is expected to produce a minimum of 10,000 barrels of crude per day. He said production could be raised to a maximum of 25,000 barrels per day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wahbi said the Wehda oil field, in the south, has a reserve of 660 million barrels. Of this, 150 million barrels can be extracted at a rate of 25,000 barrels a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Production in this field would start by the end of the rainy season, when oil wells would be fully linked to a storage facility, being constructed by the Canadian state petroleum company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Wehda (Unity) oil field is the biggest in Sudan. So far, he said, some 19 wells have been sunk there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Overall, some 45,000 barrels of crude would be pumped daily from these fields when Adar Yiel and Wehda start production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sudanese President Omar El Bashir said recently his country spends 80 percent of its export earnings on the importation of petroleum products. This adds up to some 360 million U.S. dollars annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khartoum imported the bulk of its oil from Gulf states until 1990, when this was stopped in reaction to Sudan's support for Iraqi President Sadam Hussein when he invaded Kuwait and started the Gulf War.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Foreign investors have poured in nearly 1.2<BR>billion zimdollars into the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange since government allowed them to buy and sell shares three years ago, a stockbroking firm said on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statistical analysis released in Harare, Edwards (AMPER) Company said the total foreign purchases and sales since June 23, 1993, up to June 21 this year, were valued at 2.69 billion zimdollars (269 million USD), while the net inflow was 1.194 billion zimdollars (119 million USD).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The market was still active despite the recent downward trend in the key industrial index, with speculative purchases and sales taking place in major quoted companies such as Delta Corporation, Hippo Valley, Mashonaland holdings and Nickel giant, Bindura.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The company said in a brief commentary, that during the period ending June 21, 1996, foreigners were net sellers while the local market was soft, largely due the Colcom holdings rights issue, as well as the proposed flotation of the Seed Company of Zimbabwe, and the discount company of Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreigners sold parcels of shares in at least 13 companies and bought in six quoted companies, among them, TA Holdings, and Barclays Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe Stock Market, considered to be Africa's second largest after South Africa, was now capitalised at over 40.23 billion zimdollars (4.02 billion USD). This figure is expected to soar when the Discount Company and the Seed Company are listed on the exchange before the end of the year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mugabe made the same calls when he attended the U.N. General Assembly in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, he said Zimbabwe supported the Organization of African Unity Mechanism on Conflict Resolution because African problems needed African solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, he said, this was not to ignore the role of the U.N. Security Council as the custodian of world peace and security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Zimbabwe would continue to abide by its international obligations to ensure peaceful resolution of conflicts, particularly in Africa, in the spirit of co-existence, cooperation and understanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He told parliamentarians the government intended to sign bilateral extradition treaties with such countries as South Africa, the United States and Botswana, and make sure Zimbabwe was not a &quot;safe haven for criminals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Already, he said, there were plans to open the sub-regional office of Interpol in Harare, to improve cooperation in stamping out international criminal activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Complementary to this, he said resources would be allocated to the Zimbabwe police so the force could deal with rising white collar crime in the public and private sectors.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing a public rally at Freedom Square Monday in Kasempa, about 350 kilometres (about 219 miles) north-west of Lusaka, Kaunda said President Frederick Chiluba and his ministers were spreading information accusing Kaunda of stealing the money.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Since they took over the running of the government in November 1991, I have been a free man, up to today, and have not been arrested for allegedly stealing money. Why should they continue spreading malicous information about me? Kaunda asked.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNESBURG, (PANA) - The final results of the first democratic local government election in South Africa's Kwazulu-Natal Province held last week, have revealed declining support for Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Figures released by the Election Control Center gave the Zulu-dominated Inkatha a total of 44.4 percent of the vote, followed by President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress with 33 percent and Frederiek de Klerk's National Party, with 12 percent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The remaining 10.6 percent went to the other minor parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Election officials point out that the figures represent a significant drop of 5.6 percent in overall support for the IFP, compared with the votes it won in the general election in April 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC, on the other hand, increased its total voter support by one percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most important trend which emerged from last week's local government elections is the ANC's domination of the main cities and towns in Kwazulu-Natal, in addition to its significantly improved performance in the rural areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The party's national executive committee member, Carl Niehaus, told reporters here, that the ANC won 47 percent of the vote in the urban areas, compared with only 17.2 percent by the IFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This underlined the crumbling of the IFP's support base in the towns and cities, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the mainly traditional rural areas of the province, the IFP still maintained its dominance, obtaining 71.3 percent of the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the ANC significantly improved its performance in the rural areas, with 20.6 percent of the vote, compared with only five percent in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Election officials confirmed that a total of 3.4 million voters registered for the polls, which recorded a voter turnout of 46 percent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEW YORK, United Nations (PANA) - The United Nations Secretary-General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, needs unequivocal African support to back his campaign for re-election for a second five-year term, according to diplomats here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The diplomats say an endorsement by the Organization of African Unity at its upcoming summit in Yaounde, Cameroon, would send a strong signal that Boutros-Ghali, the first African to hold the position, could not be easily pushed aside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If the OAU fails to endorse him (Boutros-Ghali), he is finished,&quot; a U.N. observer claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 73-year-old Egyptian diplomat, whose current term expires at the end of 1996, announced on June 19 that he would run for a second term because of &quot;strong encouragement from member states.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the United States, a permanent member of the Security Council -- without whose support a U.N. secretary-general may not be elected -- says it will not support him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington has accused him of being an obstacle to reform at the U.N.  and promised to use its veto, if necessary, to deny him the post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since then, the secretary-general has received &quot;unlimited support&quot; from the Egyptian government, has been virtually endorsed by other Arab states, and is said to enjoy the backing of China and France, also permanent members of the Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asian and Latin American countries have also reportedly indicated their support for Boutros-Ghali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also got a boost from the Group of Seven industrial countries who met in Lyons, France, last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The countries adopted a statement hailing &quot;concrete results&quot; of his reform of the U.N.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, there has been little or no public expression of support from Africa, his primary constituency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The day after the secretary-general's announcement, the African group at the U.N. held one of its regular meetings but did not discuss the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An African ambassador, who asked not to be identified, said the silence among Africans did not mean lack of support for the secretary-general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have been discussing it among ourselves, and the general reaction is that of surprise, disappointment and frustration at the way the U.S. went about the whole issue,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The envoy said &quot;we feel he should have a second term, just like other past secretary-generals, and that Africa should support him totally,&quot; adding: &quot;Our hope is that the OAU meeting will be able to endorse him for a second term.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. has already started consulting with African and other ambassadors to expalin its position on the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the African ambassador, &quot;they (U.S. diplomats) told us that Boutros-Ghali has lost the confidence of the people and government of the U.S., that it would be senseless for us to support him, and that their action is irrevocable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We only hope the OAU will not waver,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An official at the U.S. mission to the U.N. confirmed that efforts had begun to &quot;convince the Africans on the futility&quot; of supporting the secretary-general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have made it clear to the ambassadors that it is not an anti-African thing, it is anti-Boutros-Ghali,&quot; the official said, adding: &quot;We don't think he is the right man for the job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But according to the U.S. official, who did not want to be named, the U.S. was sympathetic to Africa's wish to have a second term and was willing to support another African candidate for the position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked what will be the U.S. reaction if the OAU endorsed the secretary-general for a second term, he said, &quot;we don't think they will endorse him...they will most likely praise him, and that's it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Egypt's ambassador to the U.N., Nabil Elaraby, feels the OAU would have to go beyond that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He (Boutros-Ghali) is the representative of a region, which is Africa,&quot; he said in New York. &quot;They will have to express their point of view.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TUNIS, Tunisia (PANA) - Tunisia's 51 athletes to the forthcoming Atlanta Olympics is the country's largest since Rome in 1960, but officials remain cautious about a large medal haul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't expect to win medals in Atlanta, because of the high level of the competition with the presence of international-class athletes and our athletes lack of maturity&quot;, Mohamed Zribi says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is the director of High Level Sports Competitions in the Ministry of Youth and Sports.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he expressed satisfaction at Tunisia's performances at recent regional and international meets, particularly during the All-African Games in Harare and those of French-speaking communities held in Paris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tunisia's Atlanta bound athletes comprise 18 soccer players and 12 for volleyball. The country qualified in six individual disciplines. There are six track and field athletics, six judokas, four boxers, three wrestlers, table-tennis player and one fencer. Athletes qualified for individual disciplines include five women, or the quarter of the team for individual sports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Qualifying such a large number of athletes at such high levelled competition is reason to be satisfied,&quot; Zribi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These first results are a testimony to the effectiveness of training of (the country's sports elites and encourages us to continue in the same way,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Atlanta Operation&quot; was launched in 1993 during a select cabinet meeting, chaired by President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A long-term national sports development plan was also worked out to ensure high level training on a scientific basis, to prepare athletes for regional and international competitions including the Atlanta Olympics and the Tunis Mediterranean Games in the year 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1996, Zribi said, about 4.5 million dinar (about 4.5 million U.S.  dollars) were spent to the training the cream of athletes. At the same time, the number of indoor sporting facilities increased from six before 1987 to 58.  Tunisia now has 74 turfed sports grounds compared to 21 just recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a new Olympic size village for the first big games of the 21st century is being built near Tunis at the cost of at least 120 million dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tunisia's soccer players are drawn against a particularly strong teams: Argentina, Portugal and the United States. However, athletes in non-team sports provide the best hope for medals in that most are African champions or have won the title several times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such could be the case of Ali Hakimi, 20, who will run the 1,500 metres in Atlanta. He already holds the 1,000 metres junior world record of 2.16:84.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will be his first participation to such an event. Our real objective is to reach the highest level of the competition. We also think about the period after Atlanta: There will be the 1997 Mediterranean Games in Bari, Italy, and the Sidney Olympics in the year 2000,&quot; Zribi says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fully recovered from his shoulder injury following the last Africa championships in Pretoria, South Africa, judoka Skander Hachicha may clinch a medal, Zribi said, &quot;if he does not meet the toughest guys in the first rounds.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is sure, we are not going to Atlanta to work as extras. We will do our best to honour Tunisian and African sports,&quot; Zribi says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">jobless people demonstrated in Bujumbura Monday in opposition to proposals for a regional military force that is to try and restore order in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proposals for the force, to come from neighboring states, follow fears that the ethnic violence between the Hutu and the Tutsi could degenerate into the kind of genocide that rocked Rwanda in 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters demanded the enrollment of youths into the national army to fight the external force. Some of their placards read: 'The Youth is Ready to Fight the Foreign Troops and the Facilitating Regime.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others read 'We Demand the Enrollment of the Youth Into the Regular Army.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally's organiser, Nyandwi Oscar, said &quot;we want to show the world that Burundi has a dynamic and reliable youth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a regional summit in Arusha, northern Tanzania on June 25, the Burundian President, Sylivestre Ntibantunganya, asked neighboring countries to provide security assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The request was accepted by the leaders of Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania and Zaire, who formed a commission to work out the force's operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The force is expected to help in putting an end to clashes between the majority Hutu and minority Tutsi. The killings have been going on since President Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, was assassinated in October 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimated 70,000 Burundians have been killed in revenge killings since Ndadaye's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The youths said they will stage another protest Tuesday to show their opposition to the proposed force. Burundi's main opposition party, the Unity for National Progress (UPRONA) has vehemently opposed the sending in of the external force.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Eight opposition members facing treason charges were Monday committed to Zambia's high court for trial after the state amended the case to also include one count of murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men, who had earlier been charged with four cases of treason, now face only two counts of treason, including one count of murder. The new charge is in connection with the death of a police officer killed in a bomb blast at Lusaka International Airport last May.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State prosecutor Teddy Nondo told Lusaka principal resident magistrate Francis Nsokolo Monday, when the eight appeared before him for mention, that the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) had issued a certificate to commit the accused to the high court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eight are all members of the main opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP) of former President Kenneth Kaunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those charged with the murder are retired army generals Joseph Chintomfwa and Nicholas Zulu, Capt. Selemani Mpangula and UNIP Central Committee member Patrick Goma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is alleged that the four had on May 23, whilst acting together with other unknown persons and with a common purpose, murdered Ordon Banda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eight also have been charged with conspiring to procure by force the alteration of the new constitution of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goma, Zulu and Mpangula have further been charged with trying to recruit one Wilfred Mwale to acquire explosives in order to bomb government installations, in a concerted campaign of terror designed to force the government to withdraw the latest constitution of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four are also charged with writing offensive graffiti carrying messages against members of parliament and government leaders, in an effort to force government to withdraw the constitution of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eight, who include Kaunda's deputy, senior chief Inyambo Yeta, UNIP central committee member Rabbison Chongo and Kaunda's press assistant, Muhabi Lungu and Kaunda's head of security, Moyce Kaulung'ombe have been in detention since June 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were earlier charged with preparing to overthrow the Zambian government by forming a terrorist group, Black Mamba, which has claimed responsibility of planting bombs in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eight detainees had their habeas corpus and bail applications rejected by the high court three weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their defence lawyers had during a habeas corpus hearing argued that the charges laid against the accused were false.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyers said it was not true that the accused were responsiable for the bomb blasts because even after their detention the bombs were still being planted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the new indictment now states that the eight were acting with other unknown people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyers had also submitted that the state had no evidence against the accused and had not made an effort during the hearing to show evidence against the accused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, high court judge Peter Chitengi had in his ruling noted that it was not imperative for the state to give evidence since it may be keeping that until trial begins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defence lawyers said they will write to the high court to see whether they can be given a special summary trial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - Unlikely as it might seem France and the United States, two NATO allies, have made claims and counter claims over which of them is the largest donor of foreign aid to Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both have claimed this honour within the past two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, it was the Americans. Outgoing U.S. Ambassador Dennis Jett said at a reception marking his country's national day, July 4, that the U.S. was the largest donor. The speech irritated several of the Europeans present.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, on the 207th anniversary of the storming of the Bastille, it was the turn of the French.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistics aside, Destremau, unlike Jett, avoided lecturing Mozambicans on how to handle their future. Destremau recipes were couched in the most general of terms, to which it would be difficult to take exception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While it is difficult today to imagine a revolution that would lead the people to take the king to the Guillotine, it is also evident that all of us, French, Mozambicans and others, should always be carrying out a kind of revolution in a modern way,&quot; Destremau said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called for an end to &quot;old habits&quot; in Mozambique as elsewhere. The struggle to abandon &quot;the old&quot; would be long and difficult, he said, &quot;but if we don't start it today, the process will take a long time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Destremau called for decentralization &quot;to give the people in the provinces the feeling that they have their destinies in their own hands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, France has a highly centralized government inherited since its revolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To carry out this cultural revolution, the rulers and all the people should have the strength and courage to abandon old concepts of excessive centralization,&quot; he said. &quot;As always, we French, directly or through the institutions of the European Union are ready to help Mozambique make these revolutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the evident surprise of some of his audience, Destremau claimed that France was &quot;the only European country that borders on Mozambique.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was referring to the maritime boundary between Mozambique and Reunion, and a handful of other islands in the Indian Ocean administered by France.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - Princess Diana of the United Kingdom has been invited to visit South Africa later this year to meet President Nelson Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The invitation was issued by South African officials, after Princess Diana failed to meet the South African leader during his state visit to the United Kingdom earlier in the week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She had requested a private meeting, but this had not been granted by the South Africans. It was felt that such a meeting might have proved offensive to Queen Elizabeth at such a sensitive stage in the divorce proceedings between Prince Charles and Princess Diana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diana was not invited to any of the functions during Mandela's state visit.  However, British officials were quick to emphasize that she had not been snubbed in any way. She simply had no specific links with South Africa, they added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although no date has been set for Diana's visit to South Africa, a spokesman in the presidency has indicated that it is likely to take place in October or November this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to meeting Mandela, she would tour various charitable organisations, as well as visit her brother - the Earl of Spencer - who lives in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All indications are that divorce proceedings between Prince Charles and Princess Diana will be finalised by the end of this month, which means that she will be officially single by the time she travels to South Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - For five years now Algerian athlete Nourredine Morcelli has been the top middle-distance runner, smashing world records in the 1000, 1500, the mile, 2000 and 3000 meter events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent years, Morcelli has emerged victorious in the several scores of competitions. His only stinging defeat occured in 1992 during the Barcelona Olympic Games, where he took 7th position in the 1500m final, contrary to all expectations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was not at my best because of an injury which delayed my preparation,&quot; says Morcelli, brushing aside allegations that he is a sympathizer of the outlawed Algerian Islamic Slavation Front and therefore avoided climbing on a podium which was used by his pro-government female athlete, Hassiba Boulmerka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boulmerka, the Algerian athlete with the highest number of medals, twice world champion and Olympic champion, had dedicated her victory to her country's women and to President Mohammed Boudiaf, assassinated some weeks earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, Morcelli remains the Arab world's most famous athlete. In Atlanta, his ambition will likely be to erase the sad memories of the Barcelona Olympics, where he failed miserably in the 1500m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since that setback, Morcelli has never relinquished his hold on the race, with a world record of 3min 27sec 37. His closest rival holds a time record two seconds different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year's Goteborg World Championships marked his third consecutive victory in the world championships. He also emerged victorious during the world championships at Tokyo in 1991 and Stuttgart in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only four other world-class athletes have won the World championship three times -- the American Carl Lewis, the Ukrainian Serguei Bubka, the Kenyan Moses Kiptanui and himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Morcelli is credited for winning the Grand-prix final ranking in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of these achievements, Morcelli is always the best paid athlete during tough duels, with about 70,000 dollars per competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sponsored by a sportwear making company and the Algerian National Hydrocarbon Company (Sonatrach), Morcelli earns enough money to make life comfortable for his seven brothers and two sisters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morcelli is so attached to his family to the extent that his brothers always accompany him to competitions. He always travels with his elder brother, Abderahmane, a former Algerian 1500m champion, who coaches him, and Ali, his young brother who plays the role of a pace-maker to improve Morcelli's performance and to tire other competitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How far will Morcelli go? No one knows exactly. However, one can safely bet that at the age of 26, Morcelli will be around for some time because of his stunning performance in the middle-distance races. A gold is what he is looking forward to in Atlanta.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria pruned Monday night the number of its athletes and officials to the Olympic Games from a speculated figure of 600 to 136.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also dropped four events from the list of 10 it had originally entered for the centennial Olympiad which begins Friday in Atlanta, United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing the changes on national television, youth and sports minister Jim Nwobodo said the Nigerian government had approved participation in sporting events that could earn the country medals.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Nigerians would not want a repeat of what happened at the Moscow '80 and Seoul '88 Olympic Games from which the country's contingents returned with &quot;a bagful of scandals rather than medals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 77 athletes and 59 officials will now represent the country at the games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria will now take part in athletics, boxing, football, table tennis, weight lifting and wrestling. It has dropped out of the judo, lawn tennis, badminton and swimming competitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Athletics accounts for the largest number in the contingent with 40 competitors made up of 21 men and 19 women athletes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In football, 22 players, made up of 18 regulars and four alternates, will represent the country as previously announced. The squad is currently in the United States, tuning up for the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The boxing team has been reduced from six to four boxers while the table tennis squad has been trimmed down from eight to four players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weightlifting team has been cut down from six to two and the wrestling team from seven to four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday's announcement ended a week of suspense and speculation about the size of the Nigerian contingent and the number officials to represent the country at the games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sports analysts however believe the decision to drop some of the sporting events, athletes and officials is due mainly to financial constraints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nwobodo had been in the federal capital throughout last week, lobbying for funds. It seems his efforts were not crowned with total success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 155 million naira (6.89 million dollars) was allocated in Nigeria's national budget for sports this year. This was just about half last year's allocation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fund-raising drive launched nationwide to mobilize funds for the country's contingent to the games does not appear to have yielded much.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BULAWAYO, South Africa (PANA) - Nineteenth century South Africans made a great trek southward to the Cape mired in Afrikaaner mythology and fleeing Zulu hostility and British rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their present day counterparts have started another great trek, but this time to the north to establish business empires with previously hostile African states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading the way is President Nelson Mandela who, at the Southern African Development Community (SADC) summit held in Johannesburg last year, declared: &quot;We must plant the seeds of Africa's rebirth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We take courage from realising that conditions for economic growth are becoming favorable throughout Africa,&quot; he told a SADC annual consultative conference in the city.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now South African conglomerates have taken his word and are venturing north to do business, taking advantage of the republic's return to democracy in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The list is endless and includes the republic's biggest hotel groups - Sun International, the Protea group, the Conservation Corporation and Southern Sun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have appointed someone to look exclusively at possibilities in sub- Saharan Africa and Indian ocean islands,&quot; said Southern Sun's chief operations executive, Helder Pereira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Southern Sun and Intercontinental have been involved in a joint thrust into Africa and are negotiating new contracts. The partnership intends to secure management contracts for existing hotels as well as new projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negotiations have been going on in Kenya, the Seychelles, Ghana, Madagascar, Nigeria and Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Southern Sun recently opened its first Holiday Inn Garden Court in Zambia - the first outside South Africa - and won plaudits from President Frederick Chiluba for bringing jobs to the impoverished nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has also been negotiating to expand its Sun Game Lodges portfolio into Namibia, Mozambique and Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Protea Group - the world's 33rd largest hotel chain - has in the last two years spent over 35 million U.S. dollars refurbishing and operating hotels in 11 African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It already runs hotels in Botswana, Malawi, Mauritius, Kenya, Reunion, Tanzania and Uganda, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sun International has also made huge investments in hotels and casinos in African and Indian ocean island hotels. It already operates hotels in Botswana, Namibia, Morocco and Swaziland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conservation corporation, which owns some top game reserves in South Africa, is working with the Zimbabwe government to open two new luxury lodges at Matetsi, 40 km from Victoria Falls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the republic's companies have been negotiating to build new hotels in Victoria Falls - a prime tourist resort in southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others have signed joint venture agreements or acquired equity in neighboring Zimbabwe's companies, encouraged by free exchange controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the retail sector, South African conglomerate, Pepko Ltd, last year sealed a deal to acquire shares in Zimbabwean clothing retail chain, Power Sales Zimbabwe Ltd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairman of the Cape Town-based company, Arnold Louw, said should the deal be successful, Pepko would expand activities of power sales in Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another South African retail giant, Pick'n Pay Stores, has signed an agreement to buy a portion of equity in one of Zimbabwe's largest supermarket chains, TM Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement, which is subject to Zimbabwean regulatory approvals, is set to come into effect in October once Meikles, the holding company of TM, has completed a corporate restructuring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's Sentrachem Ltd early this year went into a joint venture with two Zimbabwean companies, Cairns Chemicals (PVT) Ltd and Hippo Valley Estates Ltd, to establish a distillery for production of high quality alcohol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the power sector, South Africa's electricity authority, ESKOM, the world's fifth largest electricity utility, plans to link most of Africa's 700 million people on the grid using hydro-power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe in March commissioned a 35-million- dollar 400-kilovolt inter-connector, enabling Zimbabwe to import up to 300 megawatts of power - an eighth of national demand - from South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe started importing power from South Africa in January under the project jointly undertaken by ESKOM, the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) and Botswana Power Corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ESKOM was reportedly mapping out strategies to harness power from Zaire's Inga river and the Zambezi river, which forms the boundary between Zimbabwe and Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's gas giant, ENRON, is investing 600 million US dollars to develop Mozambique's Pande gas field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impetus is the signing, last year, of an agreement allowing free exchange of generating capacity among SADC states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's conglomerates, Anglo-American Corporation and GENCOR are expanding, buying mineral rights in many African countries including Ghana, Mali, Zaire and Ethiopia. For example, mining giant GENCOR is reportedly evaluating a scheme for a one-billion-dollar smelter near Maputo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several other projects are under way between South Africans and Mozambicans, under an ambitious Maputo Corridor project - a transport link between Maputo and South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Standard Bank of South Africa, one of Africa's largest financial institutions with assets of more than 26 billion dollars, has been spreading its tentacles into Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trading under the name, Stanbic, the institution now operates in Botswana, Kenya, Lesotho, Nigeria, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ghana, it operates under the name of Merchant Bank (Ghana), in Madagascar as Union Commercial Bank S.A, in Namibia as Standard Bank Namibia and in Mozambique as Banco Standard Totta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many countries to the north are embracing their former apartheid enemy with out-stretched arms but they resent the way the republic flexes its trade muscles in a show of strength.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These include Zimbabwe and Zambia, which have for years been battling to endorse preferential trade pacts with Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwean industrialist, Jonee Blachfield, believes time has come for Zimbabwe to stand up against economic dominance by South Africa and warns: &quot; If we don't, we are in trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But analysts say South Africa, with a Gross Domestic Product of 130 billion dollars - 20 times that of its nearest rival Zimbabwe - is being trapped in a web of ill-feelings for its prosperity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They must not deny that South Africa is a super power. However, South Africa must exercise its power with sensitivity, responsibility and circumspection,&quot; said Themba Sono, a lecturer in the department of business economics at South Africa's University of Witwatersrand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa is still subject to scrutiny though interest is now focused on the country's burgeoning economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In many ways, South Africa is more of an emerged than an emerging economy,&quot; said Simon Hollis, managing director of Barings in Johannesburg, in an overview of the country's economy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA)--The United States Agency for International Development has cut more than ten percent of its 25-million-dollar aid to Zambia, following it's adoption of a controversial constitution that bars former President Kenneth Kaunda from contesting presidential elections scheduled this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Usaid director in Zambia, Joseph Stepanek said Tuesday at a press briefing in Lusaka that his government was concerned that the constitution, adopted on the eve of the country's second multiparty elections, limits the right of Zambians to freely choose their president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initial cuts within USAID'S &quot;democracy and good governance program&quot; to four projects amount to approximately 2.5 million US dollars. Last year the agency spent about 25 million dollars on Zambian projects.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The projects affected are the assistance to cabinet office in streamlining its internal administration and a project to upgrade training equipment at the Zambia Institute of Mass Communication in the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others are support to the Washington-based National Democratic Institute for its work on the forthcoming elections and a project to assist the Zambian parliament in improving its internal processes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These projects represent a total of one million dollars in bilateral assistance. We will also reduce the 1996 bilateral aid program from its present level of 19,024,000 us dollars to 17,500,000, an additional cut of 1.  5 million dollars,&quot; Stepanek said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the United States has already expressed its concern to multilateral donors like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund whom it will influence to study Zambia's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stepanek said the aid cut was a result of the initial review of the US- Zambian bilateral and multilateral relations announced by the State Department last May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said donors have remained concerned about the manner the constitution was adopted when in fact the government had earlier assured the donors that the constitution would be adopted through a consensus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the amendments to the constitution were seen to reverse Zambia's commitment to an open multi-party democratic political system embraced by the Movement for Multiparty Democracy government of President Frederick Chiluba in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stepanek also noted that there was no major effort by the Zambian government to register voters in this year's scheduled presidential and general elections, which has clearly been an issue presently in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Registration of voters is one of our concerns and this has clearly been an issue right now in the country and we are worried about fair monitoring of the elections, open democracy and codes of conduct agreed upon,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stepanek, who admitted that his government has a tight budget like any other government, denied that the US was cutting aid to Zambia because of the tight budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other major donors who have threatened to cut aid to Zambia include Britain and Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia's cooperating partners and neighbors have said they feared that barring Kaunda from the presidential race might be a recipe for civil strife in the southern African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new constitution bars citizens of immigrant parents from becoming republican president and also bans traditional chiefs from participation in active partisan politics unless they resigned their traditional thrones.  Kaunda had Malawian parents.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president and director of the Institute of International Affairs of Japan, Nobuo Matsugana, said Wednesday the conference would also be aimed at promoting Asia-Africa co-operation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic and cultural ties between Zimbabwe and Japan are strong as evidenced by the assistance Harare has received from Tokyo in the fields of road construction, water and sanitation projects and policy consultation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are very happy with the political stability in Zimbabwe and the economic reforms and we are looking at fostering, enhancing and expanding our relationship,&quot; said Matsugana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe at the end of last year, completed its first phase of the economic structural adjustment program which scored some successes in so far as opening up of the market was concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International financiers are however, still pressuring the government to exercise more financial discipline and reduce the budget deficit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like other African countries, Zimbabwe is faced with a huge foreign debt burden of four billion U.S. dollars.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PARIS, France (PANA) - The Director-General of the United Nations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), Federico Mayor, held a meeting with President Nelson Mandela of South Africa on Tuesday on areas in which the organization can assist Pretoria's development programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two sides agreed to focus on human resources development, UNESCO said in a release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the present economic and social context, UNESCO's main asistance to South Africa should be in the area of human resource development, especially for those children and adults who have no access to mainstream education and vocational systems currently available,&quot; Mayor said during talks with Mandela who was on a visit in Paris.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa is still burdened with huge inequalities including 60 percent adult illiteracy among blacks and 40 percent unemployment. &quot;The heritage of educational deprivation remains a major problem,&quot; Mayor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNESCO plans to develop an intensive learning program using audio-visual materials in the multiple mother tongues of South Africans, &quot;so that vocational training can be transmitted quickly to the many, thousands of South Africans,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also agreed to expand cooperation with the South African Development Community (SADC), and said UNESCO has established an office in Pretoria to work with the country and the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For us, the SADC region remains a priority and the best context for co- operation in that part of Africa,&quot; Major said, noting the importance that his organisation places on the World Solar Summit which will be held in Harare, Zimbabwe this September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela and Mayor agreed that programs related to vocational training, education, human resource development and other activities will be futher refined during the director-general's planned visit to South Africa from September 11 to 14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela said he was grateful for the assistance UNESCO has provided and continues to provide, and the honours it has bestowed on him personally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa rejoined UNESCO in December 1994, after an absence of nearly 40 years. Sicne then, the organization's activities in that country have focused on education, adult literacy, culture, communication, science and technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNESCO awarded its Simon Bolivar prize to Mandela in 1983 while he was still incarcerated in South Africa's Roben Island prison, in recognition of his courageous struggle for justice and human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Released after 27 years in prison in February 1990, Mandela paid a visit to UNESCO in June that year, during his first trip to Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years later, he was honoured with UNESCO's Houphouet Boigny peace prize, an award he shared with former South African president Frederik de Klerk in October 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Tuesday meeting, Mayor bestowed the UNESCO Gandhi medal on Mandela, describing him as&quot;a symbol of peace, wise leadership, tolerance and farsightedness&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNESCO also mounted a photographic exhibition that chronicles the life of the South African leader. The exhibition of 27 mainly black-and-white photographs by South African photographer, Alf Khumalo, will run through July 30.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - In an effort to eradicate polio, the Zambian government intends to vaccinate 1.6 million children below the age of five, irrespective of their current immunization status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The anti-polio vaccination will be held under the country's national immunization days on July 19 and 20 and on August 23 and 24, health officials said in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambian national immunization days will be held as part of a global strategy to eradicate polio from Africa by the year 2,000.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children are expected to be given two extra doses of the oral polio vaccine with a five-week gap between each dose. The national immunization team has selected two strategies to reach children in all communities in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These children will get their doses at fixed vaccination posts or from mobile teams moving from house-to-house. The government has also declared this coming Friday and August 23 as half-days to enable the public to take children to be vaccinated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poliomyelitis is a crippling disease caused by a virus, known as &quot;wild polio virus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virologists say that For every person having clinical symptoms of paralytic polio, there are 99 others infected who look healthy but spreading the virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under normal circumstances the virus survives only in human body. It can however live for a few days in the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the last decades in Zambia, cases of poliomyelitis have been identified throughout the country. Statistics from the country's virology laboratory indicate that there were four Acute Flaccid Paralysis cases in 1992, eight in 1994, 45 in 1995 and six confirmed polio cases in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the expanded program on immunization was introduced in 1975, at least 75 percent of Zambian children younger than one year were vaccinated against poliomyelitis, by the end of 1995. Some 26 African countries, including Zambia, are expected to hold full or partial immunization days in 1996 under a global commitment to make Africa a polio-free continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia is grouped together with Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda in the eastern Africa polio epidemiological block.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - AIDS caused human development setbacks of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">between 10 years and six years in five eastern and central African states during the 1980-1992 period, says a United Nations report released Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Human Development Report&quot; issued by the UN Development Program (UNDP) shows that worldwide, HIV/AIDS caused an average loss of 1.3 years of human development progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document says setbacks were particularly severe in Zambia, where it reversed human resource progress by ten years, Tanzania (eight years), Rwanda (seven years) and the Central African Republic (more than six years).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report bases its facts on findings by researchers at Columbia University and the Havard Institute for International Development in the United States. Burundi, Kenya, Malawi, Uganda and Zimbabwe lost between three and five years in human development, says the document. The countries mentioned are in what is described as the AIDS epicentre, where prevalence of the human immunedeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, range from between seven and 13 percent. The researchers used a method which compared the actual 1980 and 1992 human development index with the estimated 1992 index that would have occured in the absence of AIDS. Although tuberculosis causes more deaths since 1980, says the report, &quot;AIDS has had a greater impact on human development precisely because AIDS deaths are concentrated in the age group 20-45,&quot; says the report. &quot;This finding is significant. It shows that it is now out of date to argue that HIV/AIDs is an exaggerated health crisis diverting attention and funding from more important, though less spectacular, health problems of developing countries.&quot; UNDP cautioned that governments that do not take the AIDS threat seriously now, or shy away from action because of cultural or religious sensivities, &quot;will pay the price later.&quot; &quot; More resources, political commitment and innovation need to be brought to bear against this pandemic, while still maintaining adequate attention to other health challenges,&quot; the UNDP report says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) - Sudan has agreed to the use of C-130 aircraft for the delivery of urgent relief supplies to the south of the country, the official daily 'Al Engaz Alwwtani' reported Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khartoum had barred the delivery of relief supplies to the south by aircraft after claiming that some organizations involved in ferrying them were taking arms and ammunition to the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SPLA has been fighting the central government in Khartoum since 1983.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sudan has allowed the use of C-130 planes for transportation of relief,&quot; the state minister at the ministry of social planning, Majzoub al Ahalifa, was quoted as saying Wednesday by the official Sudan News Agency (SUNA). &quot; Other planes will soon start flights for the transportation of relief and other materials within the context of the UN-sponsored Operation Lifeline Sudan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) was organized in 1988 by the UN, the Sudanese government, and the SPLA to facilitate the delivery of relief supplies to people trapped by the fighting in southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western donors were last week reported to have made an appeal for relief supplies to be allowed through. This follows an acute shortage of food in the war affected areas due to the ban on relief flights imposed by the Sudanese government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sudanese official also said the UN had agreed to use Malakal, in Sudan's Upper Nile state, for distribution of the relief supplies instead of the Kenyan town of Lukishcokio.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Already the greatest sprinter Africa has ever produced, Namibia's Frankie Fredericks stands on the threshold of immortality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the eight fastest men in the world settle into the starting blocks for the Olympic 100m final on the evening of July 27, Fredericks will have a psychological advantage. Regarded as one of the best sprinters in the world after two silver medals in Barcelona and a world 200m title in Stuttgart in 1993, this year Fredericks has just been getting better and better .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now he knows that if the form book holds he will be crowned Olympic champion in the blue riband event of the Games and join a long list of legends whose names are recorded for posterity on the Olympic victors' roll.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fredericks has long been thought of as more of a 200m man than a 100m sprinter, but he has always begged to differ with the experts on that account.  &quot;I think of myself as just a sprinter. I don't think I'm necessarily better at one event than the other. I've just had better luck in the 200m,&quot; says Fredericks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year he seems to have proved his point. After setting a world best over the seldom run indoor 100m in February he followed up for good measure with an incredible world record over 200m, reducing Linford Christie's 1995 mark of 20.25 seconds to 19.92. He equalled his 100m personal best of 9.95 at St Denis on June 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a cold night in Helsinki on June 25 he came within two hundredths of a second of the 100m world record. He clocked 9.87 seconds and left world champion Donovan Bailey of Canada two metres in his wake. A week later in Lausanne he went even faster but his 9.86 on the same track where Leroy Burrell set his world record two years before was still agonisingly short of the American's mark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fredericks maturation into the ranks of the truly great has taken time, he will turn 28 later this year, but as the likes of Linford Christie and Carl Lewis have shown, that is not old for a sprinter. Although he went to Brigham Young University in America when he was 20 and got to compete on the extremely competitive collegiate circuit, Fredericks's chance to race in international events came later than for most athletes because of his country's ties with apartheid South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Namibia finally got its independence Fredericks was eager to make his mark. After familiarising himself with the Grand Prix circuit in 1990 he set an African 100m record of 9.95 seconds in fifth place at the 1991 Tokyo world championships and took silver in the 200m behind Michael Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His Olympic and world championship successes followed as well as the 1994 Commonwealth 200m title and a silver once more in the 200m at last year's world championships in Gothenburg where Johnson was again the bugbear. His main triumphs have come in the 200m and for the past five year's he has never been ranked outside the world's top two in the event, topping the pile in 1993, but always there has been Michael Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not that Fredericks has never beaten Johnson, he claimed his scalp once in 1992, thrice in 1993 and twice in 1994. But those victories came at times when Johnson was either not focusing on the 200m or had injury problems.  Since Fredericks won the 200m in Lausanne in July 1994 with Johnson unusually back in fourth, the Texan with the peculiar gait went on to create an air of invincibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even with Johnson's super human performances in Gothenburg last year and at the American Olympic trials a few weeks ago he himself always maintained he could be beaten. He may well have just been saying that to retain some semblance of modesty but he obviously didn't count on it being anytime in the immediate future, especially with the Olympics looming on the horizon. Fredericks too was never completely overawed by Johnson despite studying his rear profile too many times for comfort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the race between Michael and me is decided by the lanes. If he's in lane three and I'm in lane four then it makes things difficult but if it's the other way round then I feel I can beat him. As long as I can chase him off the turn and run a good final 100m then I know it can be anybody's race,&quot; Fredericks said last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At last Friday's Bislett Games in Oslo Johnson came to the meet on a high.  At the American Olympic trials in Atlanta 11 days earlier he had shattered the oldest world record in the books, lowering Italian Pietro Mennea's drug- and-altitude enhanced 200m time of 19.72 from 1979 to a 19.66.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unbeaten since his slip up in Lausanne in 1994 and overwhelming favourite for the 200m/400m double at the Olympics, Johnson had enough reason to show a little swagger. Fredericks too was on a roll but it was in the 100m that he had been excelling and he was still not considered a match for Johnson over 200m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ominously for Fredericks he was drawn in the lane outside Johnson and would not be able to key off the American. When the gun went Fredericks didn't worry about Johnson though and concentrated on running a good bend. They hit the home straight together and a titanic battle ensued as the lead see-sawed back and forth. The time in such cold conditions was immaterial but at the tape it was Fredericks who held the advantage, 19.82 to 19.85.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within an instant Johnson was mortal once more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That the guardians of the sport, the International Amateur Athletic Federation, saw fit to alter the Olympic schedule to accommodate Johnson's ambitions for a unique double shows just how convinced they were that it was worth their while to lose a little face by bowing to the wishes of a mere athlete. An all-American hero at an American Olympics would be good for the television and marketing men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And to the sporting moguls the interests of this constituency are primary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Fredericks threatens to spoil the whole show. For not only could it be Johnson going for the second half of a historic double when they line up for the 200m final on August 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Johnson manages to win the 400m and Fredericks the 100m, the 200m final promises to be one of the most exciting encounters of the Games as they both aim for a second shot at glory.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - You can't get more Aryan and less African than vodka, despite the inroads being made by two brands, Absolut and Smirnoff, as the happy egalitarian drink of the new South Africa. Historically the warming mother's milk of Russian peasants, it was distilled in hovels and drunk by blond peasants throughout the frozen north; the aspirational drink of the Francophile aristocracy was, of course, champagne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vodka became glamorous in 1917, the working-class drink of Bolshevik revolutionaries. Russian emigres, nostalgic for the Winter Palace, added glamour as they tossed glass after glass down their throats in nightclubs from Paris to New York.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, this profoundly 20th-century drink hasn't looked back: Lech Walesa's Solidarity Movement made it wildly fashionable in the West in 1981, and the media, advertising and fashion stars and wannabees in Armani and Lacroix haven't stopped reaching for the Stolichnaya, the Absolut and the Smirnoff ever since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smirnoff entered the marketing fray with gusto by taking the young fashion design route, and started its Smirnoff Young Designer Awards in the early 1980s. It was at the height of London streetstyle, with stars like John Galliano, John Richmond and Body Map taking the international scene by storm.  The brand got instant fashion cred --- something it has never lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swedish Absolut (established in 1879) began its own aggressive marketing campaign in the US, where, according to representative Lindsay Kersh, it took six years to make Absolut the generic word for vodka, By shrewd promotions and other below-the-line tactics, Absolut became synonymous with art and design; chic Manhattan culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now it seems the two brands are poised to embark on their very own South African style wars, with Absolut running its own student fashion competition and design promotions in glossies Cosmopolitan and House and Leisure.  Smirnoff SA, after scoring the huge PR coup of holding the Smiroff International Fashion Awards in Cape Town last year, is about to scoop yet more publicity with its South African finals prior to the International Awards in Toronto during November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a bit of a fight coming up&quot; says Kersh, &quot;because Smirnoff is going at it much more strongly. They're more proactive than they were. The awards last year were brilliant, people were talking about the event for weeks afterwards. They sell just about everywhere. We reach one percent of the market but it's the very exclusive part of the market. Because we're big in the US, the image-conscious want Absolut --- they'll take most things that are big overseas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because Absolut apparently has a fraction of the Smirnoff budget, its campaign has been pretty agressive since launching in August 1994. Some cruelly say the sponsorship has been indiscriminate: virtually any contemporary art event in Johannesburg is an Absolut event, making lots of artists very happy. Absolut will provide booze for the Gay Pride Rave as well as the South African Union of Jewish Students, not known for fin-de-siecle camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are now in the second year of the Absolut Vodka Cosmopolitan Classics Showcase, whereby designers create garments bearing the logo. This year they're working with Elle magazine on a student fashion award --- at exactly the same time as Smirnoff has been briefing students on its Innervision project. Confused? While sponsorship of events has been generous, maybe the message has become clouded by fumes of 40 percent proof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, the mass-appeal Smirnoff is emerging as the more discerning drink, with its sponsorship of jazz at Grahamstown and the SIFA awards in Durban in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To take part in the Smirnoff Awards has been incredible: this year, 600 students from all over the country applied and we've got it down to 24 for the local finals,&quot; says Sue Walker, promotion and events co-ordinator. &quot; Students are our direct target market, hitting the 18 to 25 age group.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shana Edelstein is head of Johannesburg's London International School of Fashion. Last year, it was one of her students who won the South African finals. It's likely to be the same this year; her students are talented, ambitious, challenging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she sounds a note of caution. &quot;The competitions are great. They motivate the students and give them a taste of what it's like to be a designer, have your clothes on the ramp, get the acclaim. But what worries me is the follow-up. Once the competition is over, that's it. There is no infrastructure in place to help the students, despite the incredible international links of a company like Smirnoff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Promotion is, after all, about selling product --- despite the fanfare and speeches about young talent. Perhaps the two drinks companies should stop and think about what they're doing. Sure, they're showcasing young talent, but perhaps they'd do better to make the public aware that creativity counts, whatever the proof.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - While President Mandela was busy persuading the British to invest in South Africa and that all would be fine back home in Thabo Mbeki's 1999, some of the country's top musicians were also doing their bit for the national image this week. They were on show to the cream of British business and society in the Prince's Trust Concert in London on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Billed to be in the audience, of course, were Queen Elizabeth II and Mandela himself, the patrons of this year's beneficiary, The Nation's Trust -- - launched in South Africa during the queen's visit here in March last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hugh Masekela, Sibongile Khumalo, Jabu Khanyile and Bayete, Soshanguve Black Tycoons and Ladysmith Black Mambazo were all scheduled to strut their stuff in Two Nations Celebrate, along with a 30-piece big band put together by Phil Collins to pay tribute to the music of Buddy Rich. The band was to be conducted by Quincy Jones and featured guest artists like Tony Bennett and David Sanborn.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African line-up --- chosen by the concert promoter in London, Harvey Goldsmith --- represents powerful, time-tested traditions: township pop tinged with West African music and jazz, plus the rural mbube rhythms of the Tycoons and Ladysmith. It's definitely not the place for township house, serious jazz or white rock --- all of which would be a lot like taking coals to Newcastle anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concert, an annual fund-raising event, costs British companies Pounds 10 000 for booths of eight seats, plus 10 stall seats for people from communities of their choice. Last year the event raised nearly R90- million, mostly through the sale of TV rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this year the money is not just for British charity. The Prince's Trust feeds an international group of charities, The Nation's Trust, and part of the funds will be coming our way via the local Nation's Trust. &quot;The trust aims to help disadvantaged young people,&quot; said Clive Hardwich, media liaison officer, at Sun City-sponsored rehearsals for the musicians last week. Added Norman Malatjie of the trust: &quot;There's study support, developing young entrepreneurs and a leadership development programme.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African artists had two days of rehearsals at Sol's Folly before jetting off to London on Monday for two more days of rehearsals before the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soshanguve Black Tycoons, an mbube group similar to Ladysmith Black Mambazo (&quot;people always mix us up - -- but it's often us singing on the ads you hear, so maybe this concert will help people recognise us&quot;) did a gorgeous number about Mozambique in the rehearsal, followed by two solo numbers by Khumalo, including one unlikely combination of samba and Sotho lyrics called MaCongo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Masekela did his most famous tune, Stimela, while Khanyile, not at the rehearsal, was scheduled to do Mmalo-we and Umshado before the finale --- Shosholoza seguing into the full Nkosi Sikel' iAfrika, not the shortened combination with Die Stem. The musicians were due to be joined by a 100- strong choir for the finale, consisting of South African &quot;exiles&quot; living in London. (Surely exiles are called expatriates by now?)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The artists are not being paid,&quot; said Billy Domingo, Sun City's entertainment operations manager and artistic director of the South African segment, &quot;unless their own record companies pay them, which is what is happening with Hugh. But the Prince's Trust pays no one --- it's all for charity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm excited obviously,&quot; said Khumalo, wearing tracksuit and takkies at the rehearsal and watching Domingo rehearse the backing singers, &quot;but nervous as well because it's got to work and it's got to work good. But I'm sure it'll all come together on the night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, man, you must get down and dance!&quot; exclaimed Domingo to the women. &quot; What's all this hand stuff? Move your body!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Billy,&quot; said a grim Khumalo, &quot;you can't dance like that in full-length evening gowns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well then, just lift your dress and dance,&quot; he replied, demonstrating the skirt-lift and a sensuous wiggle. &quot;Okay,&quot; said Khumalo, leaping on to the stage, &quot;but then I'm wearing really thick tights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, let me tell you, there aren't many singers who move to the music with nearly as much joy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M-Net will screen behind-the-scenes footage of the London concert on July 18 at 6.30pm, with further coverage on Front Row at 8pm. The concert will be screened on M-Net at 8pm on July 19.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The threatened strike in the clothing industry over wage increases will be disastrous for the already crippled sector, says labour analyst Gavin Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The industry is on its knees, having suffered from massive closures, resulting in about 20 000 job losses in the past five years, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the industry in the middle of tariff reform, Brown argues the only alternative is a compromise by the union and employers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wage talks between the South African Clothing and Textile Workers' Union (Sactwu) and the National Employer Caucus of the Clothing Industry (representing 1 200 factories) reached deadlock, with unions demanding a 10% wage increase, paid maternity leave, increased provident fund benefits, changes to the job grading system and better wage bonuses.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sactwu is demanding a 10% increase and embarked on a strike ballot among its 100 000 members on Wednesday. It hopes to have results by Monday on whether or not workers are in favour of a national strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strike will, however, cost the industry R15,5- million in lost turnover and workers about R6,2- million in lost wages each day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johann Baard, chief negotiator for employers and Seardel industrial relations head, says employers appealed to workers ahead of the national ballot to consider the consequences of striking and also the timing; President Nelson Mandela and industrialists were spearheading a foreign investment drive in Britain and Europe. He says Sactwu's planned strike will further prejudice the future of an industry already on the brink of collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sactwu general secretary Jabu Ncgobo agrees the industry is going through hard times, but argues that workers are being forced into a strike because management refuses to meet basic wage demands. The wage increases, he argues, are far below the inflation rate, leaving workers virtually living below the bread line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ncgobo says employers could demonstrate their commitment to workers by upping salaries and agreeing to a substantial increase --- at least 8,5%, to be topped up by a 1% provident fund contribution and another 1% bonus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baard says employers may go for an 8,25% increase, but more than this would be unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provident fund contributions depend on what workers and unions put into the kitty and this is matched by employers. Unfortunately, workers with long records of service in factories do not regard the benefits as sufficient to see them through their retirement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amina Baker worked in a clothing factory for nearly 30 years and received R6 000, while &quot;Sharkey&quot; Davids stayed with his company for 38 years and reaped a mere R4 100 from his provident fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the heart-breaking stories, Baard says employers do care about provident funds and are committed to its improvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he argues that benefit levels stand in direct line to contributions made, adding that the blame for poor pay-outs can be shouldered by workers and unions on the one hand and employers on the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baard sees the solution for better pay-outs in unions getting a mandate from members to contribute more in to the provident fund by, for instance, taking a portion of their wage increases and putting that into the fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ncgobo says workers' wage increases are so low they prefer the cash in hand rather than pumping it into a fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sactwu's ultimate goal is to have contributions from both sides at 7,5%, but contributions vary from region to region, from 3% to 5% of total salary contributed to the fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baard says employers will commit themselves to providing incremental increases each year should workers during this round of negotiations give 1% of their increase to the provident fund, which he says, is a form of saving and investing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gavin Brown and Associates predicted in their collective bargaining survey for this year that the clothing and textile industry will have wage settlements between 7% and 9%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the industry in irreversible decline and Asian countries able to manufacture goods at a quarter of the price it takes to make goods here, coupled with low tariffs, the industry is destined to shrivel. Some analysts say the clothing sector will become a smaller industry with more competition in niche markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baard agrees that if the current rate of decline is not arrested, the industry can be &quot;accurately described as on the brink of collapse&quot; because:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* It is in the middle of a programme of tariff reform, under the World Trade Organisation agreement;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The industry is facing severe prejudice as a result of the daily inflow of illegal imports. &quot;The imports evade the customs net due to the inefficiency of the Customs and Tariffs department and we find tons of finished garments are being dumped on our domestic market without any import duties.&quot; This is killing the clothing industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while Sactwu is conducting its strike ballot, employers are voting on whether to exercise their right to lock-out. In the Cape, with the bulk of clothing factories, 94% of employers have voted in favour of the lock-out clause.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Contrary to popular opinion, global, not regional, trade is the key to economic growth in South Africa, says Professor Jeffrey Herbst of Princeton University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Southern African market,&quot; he says, &quot;is just too small to provide the kind of trading opportunities this country needs to fuel substantial growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the last 25 years, the region as a whole performed poorly, with its share of the global economy decreasing from 0,76% in 1970 to 0,58% in 1993.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Southern African countries will be far better served by reforming their economies to take advantage of the roughly 99,4% of the world economy that is outside their region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Herbst, in Johannesburg to address the South African Institute for International Affairs conference on South Africa in the Global Economy, believes the reason for this concentration on local markets is historical and ideological. Its roots lie in colonisation and the subsequent &quot;Balkanisation&quot;, reified by the Organisation of African Unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a sense that intra-African trade is more 'pure', serving the pan- African ideal, while entering the international arena has 'grubby' connotations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the truth is that trade blocs within Africa have not worked; the continent is littered with examples of failed attempts at economic integration. The East Africa Federation collapsed because Kenya was seen as the dominant, and therefore, threatening partner. The omens are not good for the Southern African Development Community, either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Herbst points out that South Africa's share of total imports by Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe amounts to between one-third and 40%. &quot;It is hard to believe that South Africa will be able to increase these market shares significantly, especially given that in all of the countries in the region, imports of fuel, which South Africa cannot meet, probably account for a substantial portion of the import profile.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other side of the equation is that Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe export only 13%, 2% and 17%, respectively, of their products to South Africa. &quot;There is a limit to how much of Zambia's copper, Malawi's tobacco or Zimbabwe's tobacco, gold or ferro-alloys this country needs ... The immediate scope for increased regional exports to South Africa will be mainly a function of economic growth rather than increasing market share.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only way out of the commodities trap is to concentrate on manufacturing exports, or, in the case of South Africa, services even. &quot;The electronic banking system here is much more sophisticated than anything in the United States or Europe. There's one opportunity already,&quot; says Herbst. And there are precedents: India has become a significant exporter of computer programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has had a mixed reception in Africa, as has the concept of globalisation. &quot;The failure to use the Uruguay round to make trade reform more credible is especially unfortunate because ... to stabilise an economy and, eventually, to garner new investment, getting prices 'right' and even making fundamental reforms of institutions is not enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Herbst ends on a warning note: &quot;The new international trade regime will be possibly harmful, and, more probably, simply irrelevant, to those countries that do not reform.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A major multinational company has been urged to buy Johnnic's stake in Toyota South Africa, worth more than R230-million, for fear that a successful bid by the National Empowerment Consortium (NEC) could jeopardise the company's prospects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confidential documents obtained by the Mail &amp; Guardian reveal that top- level meetings were held abroad to persuade the chief executives of the multinational to buy out the 21,4% Toyota stake in the Johnnic portfolio held by the Anglo American Corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the reasons given for &quot;seizing the opportunity&quot; for a deal that would partly thwart the biggest black economic empowerment deal are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Buying the Johnnic stake would make the rest of the bid more affordable to the black investors;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Possible New Africa Investments Limited (Nail)/NEC internal divisions and &quot;lack of&quot; industrial business experience could negatively impact on Toyota's business decisions;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Nail/NEC has more interest in Johnnic's media interests;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Nail/NEC has more interest in service-oriented business with smaller capital requirements, quicker dividend returns and more opportunity for black advancement than in an industrial environment; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A possible hostile takeover of Toyota should the black investors decide to sell to raise cash to pay their debts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, the proponents of the plan made clear there were no longer fears that black investors were most likely to be overly friendly to trade unions nor fears about the possible relationship between black investors and the workers --- the biggest threat they saw was in black investors not realising enough cash to service their huge loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal was to have gone through by the last week of June or first week of July and extensive precautionary steps were taken to &quot;prevent press leaks, speculation or rumours&quot; before a major announcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Page two of a summary of the document states: &quot;(What is) not negotiable is that management of Toyota should remain in the hands of the present South African management and its appointees for the motivation of the present capable management.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, when asked to comment, Bert Wessels, Toyota South Africa executive chairman, referred M&amp;G to the multinational and Anglo American, saying he was &quot;not empowered to speak&quot; for other companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He nevertheless stressed that Toyota South Africa &quot;would welcome black investors&quot; should the NEC bid succeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M&amp;G attempts this week to obtain confirmation from the multinational company were unsuccessful. A staff member said the top executives responsible for Africa &quot;were out of town&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proponents of the Toyota deal claim that both Dr Nthato Motlana of Nail and the NEC's Wiseman Nkuhlu &quot;were not interested&quot; in the Toyota shares because the company had a low yield dividend policy which would not be useful for generating the high income required to service the loans needed by the black investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Motlana was quick to distance himself from these claims. &quot;I have made no such statement. Anglo made the offer (to sell Johnnic) to us as a package, you can't pick and choose which assets you want to buy. All this is just people talking and nothing else. Some say Nkuhlu is only interested in the Premier Food shares and nothing else --- this is not true,&quot; said Motlana emphatically.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The grand-scale fudging of issues to protect sacred cows in the oil industry continued apace this week with the release of the long- awaited Lambrechts report on deregulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report advises the government to retain the status quo for at least three to five years, while the already over-researched industry is again studied and a master plan drawn up to reduce the government's involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, by Izak Lambrechts of the University of Stellenbosch, had been touted as central to the government's response to growing local and international pressure to loosen its stranglehold on the industry, built up during the sanctions-bound apartheid era.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commentators have expressed serious misgivings about the fact that yet another report on the oil industry has recommended yet another study into the pros and cons of deregulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Particularly contentious issues are subsidies to Sasol and Mossgas, the monopolies enjoyed by Petronet and Soekor and the role of the Central Energy Fund and Strategic Fuel Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pick 'n Pay group enterprises managing director Gareth Ackerman said he was now &quot;very seriously&quot; considering approaching the Constitutional Court about continued delays in deregulating the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deregulation had been widely expected to involve allowing supermarkets to sell petrol at discount prices as well as doing away with a wide range of other controls over the sale, distribution, storage and exploration for petroleum products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are re-looking at our options and one of them may well be a challenge in the constitutional court,&quot; Ackerman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African Petroleum Industry Association (Sapia) director Colin McClelland agreed that it was disappointing that the report, though stressing the need for deregulation, had not recommended a shorter time-frame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, he said, the petroleum industry could not support deregulation while Sasol still received subsidies from the government --- and they would be in place until at least 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister Penuell Maduna was not available for comment, but some officials agreed &quot;the report is a damp squib&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The government's failure to sell Mossgas --- and the bungled announcement of the fiasco --- has highlighted the political power struggle over the fate of the synthetic fuel producer. The struggle may have cost the taxpayer over R100-million the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Superficially, the botched announcement of the failed sale was about a lack of communication among the plethora of state officials monitoring the sale -- - or a &quot;funny farm&quot;, as one senior state oil official put it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the botch was in fact the latest of a string of examples of competing factions in government using Mossgas as an expensive political football.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior official in the mineral and energy affairs department, two members of the Ministerial Task Team (MTT) and two members of the Central Energy Fund (CEF) agreed the announcement had been botched and that it should not have come from the CEF --- it should have come from Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister Penuell Maduna.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent events have bolstered the view that the Mossgas sale process was to a large extent a sham - -- that many of those involved never intended to sell it, but instead used the chance of a sale to justify a call to Cabinet to spend R850-million on a life-lengthening expansion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the anti-sale team have suggested that when the government gave the green light to a sale in December last year, it in fact had only given authorisation to &quot;test the market&quot; and a sale was not on the table. Such comments make it unsurprising that, as a senior state oil official says, there were no companies &quot;waiting with big fat cheques&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mossgas's history is studded with long delays by politicians over crucial decisions about the plant's future. Former mineral and energy affairs minister Pik Botha and other politicians involved with the industry made clear their fear of choosing whether to sell, scrap or expand the plant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is estimated the delays over expanding the plant have cost Mossgas R40- million in operating profit and added R60-million to the R850-million it will now cost to expand it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This procrastination has been accompanied by a hefty outlay on consultants.  The Mossgas monitoring panel --- advisers hired to investigate the feasibility of expanding the project --- alone cost R6,5-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The army monitoring the Mossgas sale included the MTT --- four civil servants and advisers from the mineral and energy affairs, trade and industry and finance departments --- the CEF, the monitoring panel, a merchant bank and an international energy specialist. Somewhere on the fringe lurked Botha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The press release announcing the failure was not regretful, but contained more than a hint of relief that the hi-tech fuel from gas operation could remain in state hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it was not a case of the CEF hijacking the process. For although there have been suggestions that the CEF is keen to hold on to Mossgas to preserve its empire, it appears the struggle is not between the old-guard sanctions-buster and the new government. Instead, it seems to be between a faction in the new government that is not keen on relinquishing control of Mossgas and one that is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of the anti-sale faction and part of the MTT is Paul Jourdan, special adviser to the trade and industry department. He has grand plans for a substantial state role in the South African fuel and petrochemical sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears the MTT was unanimous that none of the bids passed muster.  However, senior officials involved in the sale believe the apparent fight in the government over whether or not to sell Mossgas discouraged buyers --- in particular the troika of South African chemical companies, Sentrachem, Sasol and AECI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it has been argued that the criteria used to judge the bids made a sale virtually impossible, backing the argument that the process was a sham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Little has been said about how the bids were judged. The press release declared the bids did not satisfy the &quot;objectives in regard to value, balance of payments and continued employment, or provide for a more effective utilisation of Mossgas assets&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears many of the Mossgas sellers were bent on the impossible task of selling it to a company that would continue to keep it running as a synfuel plant, resorting to the Sasol argument that synthetic fuel saves South Africa foreign exchange. Hence the inclusion of a &quot;balance of payments&quot; criteria for the sale. There are, however, few companies outside South Africa with synfuel expertise, suggesting again that there were some involved in the sale who did not expect to see it go through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there were such strong arguments against selling it, why hire merchant banks and other advisers at huge cost --- unless it was the only way of persuading Cabinet to authorise more capital expenditure. Mossgas's gas reserves are expected to be completely depleted next year. The expansion will give it five more years, but the longer the wait the more expensive it becomes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some analysts argue it might even have been worth giving Mossgas away just to free up the hundreds-of- millions in subsidies poured into it every year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The botched press release was an appropriate finale. It came from the CEF, and not from government which took until Tuesday to say anything. The MTT asked the CEF to make the statement. An unapproved rough draft went out on Friday, July 5. It was retracted, checked by the MTT, and sent out again on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a chance that the CEF will consider joint ventures and strategic alliances arising from the bids --- arguably not enough to make up for the fact that Mossgas is exactly where it was two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many industry officials and commentators believe the affair has shown that a decade after former state president PW Botha made one of the National Party's most incompetent economic decisions by authorising the R11-billion splurge on the Mossel Bay white elephant, little has been learnt.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team's coach, Fathi Lamkoumar, will not have a difficult task handling tough opponents like Russia, Yugoslavia and the Netherlands, three of the world's leading volley-ball nations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tunisians are certainly outsiders in this group, although they might snatch a set here and there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up to now, no African team has ever managed to win a an olympic tournament.  This only shows the wide gap between the African continent's volley-ball standard and the others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tunisian team came last during the World Volley-ball Cup organized in Japan, in 1995. It won only two sets against Cuba (1-3) and China (1-3), out of the ten or so matches played during the competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African teams performed poorly during the Seoul Olympic games in 1988 and in Barcelona four years ago when Tunisia and Algeria failed to win a single set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tunisian team plays its first match on Saturday against the Netherlands, which won second place in Barcelona. That match will show whether Tunis has made any progress since 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To get to Atlanta, the Tunisians beat their neighbors Algeria and Morocco last March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Baba Sy, vice-president of the African Volley-Ball Confederation (CAVB) and expert of the International Volley-Ball Federation (FICB), Africa's dismal performance in the sport is due to inadequate competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The level of play is too low and far below world standards,&quot; said Baba Sy, who is a Senegalese. He added that the other teams play a rapid game.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Winter time is circumcision time for Xhosa- speaking boys knocking on the doors of adulthood in parts of Zimbabwe's south- western Matabeleland region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Circumcision or chiselling off of the foreskin on the male organ is a centuries-old tradition among the Xhosa people, who settled in Zimbabwe in the early 19th century under Zulu King Mzilikazi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Xhosa elders in Bubi and Insiza districts, the practice, which marks the transition from boyhood to manhood, is a traditional rite that every male seeking the recognition of society should look forward to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who have attempted to evade it have suffered the humiliation of being shunned by the community, particularly women who privately debate the sexual merits of circumcised and uncircumcised men.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You might marry and raise a family until you grow grey hair but you will be treated like a boy. You do not take part in adult affairs and even children call you by your first name,&quot; says German Mpengesi of Bubi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Circumcision marks much more than just becoming an adult. It is also a symbol of our deeply entrenched traditional values whose links with the past shapes the destiny of Xhosa heritage,&quot; adds Elem Nyilika of Fort Rixon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpengesi and Nyilika are among the several Xhosa elders who supervise similar ceremonies currently taking place in areas where pockets of Xhosa- speaking people live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It all begins when boys turn 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike in the past when one big ceremony was done for several teenagers considered old enough to marry, the practice now is for each family to hold its own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Winter is the ideal time because the wounds do not go septic and there is not much field work to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ceremony, which lasts a full day and night, involves feasting on mountains of food and traditional beer, during which the boys, dressed in animal skins, are mentally prepared to endure the pain without even a shriek as that would be considered cowardly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An all-night extravaganza of traditional song and dance and ancestral worship in a cattle kraal is followed by circumcision at dawn by an expert surgeon, whose skills and expertise command the confidence of the entire community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the foreskin is cut off, the affected part is bandaged with maize leaves believed to have medicinal properties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have circumcised hundreds of boys in the last 15 years, most of whom have their own families. Because of my experience, I have never made a mistake,&quot; boasts 55-year old surgeon Den Nzombane of Insiza after a ceremony for four boys in fort Rixon's Village Four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The boys are then herded into a bee-hive hut (ibhuma) where they are counselled on the responsibilities of adulthood, which include fending for one's self, starting a family and participating in community affairs as an equal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A real test of endurance demands that the boys spend the first eight post- circumcision days on a diet of sadza (thick maize meal porridge) without any relish and no water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are allowed to leave the ibhuma to relieve themselves only.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are then deployed for about a month or more in the bush, where they are expected to live by their own means, including hunting and picking wild fruit. Contact with the village community is strictly forbidden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This period has its own share of scandal and fun as some boys sneak to their girlfriends or to seek warm clothes and home-cooked food. This is not allowed as the boys have bodyguards who also sometimes conspire with them to do mischief,&quot; says Mpengesi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After passing the test of endurance, the boys triumphantly return to their respective homes after burning down the ibhuma. They are required to build new bedrooms befitting their adulthood by moving out of their boyhood huts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A man will have been born. He joins the ranks of adults and can now marry,&quot; says Mpengesi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to the rigorous nature of the ceremony and the pain endured, some boys have in the past attempted to escape, only to return to the fold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of four brothers, Bongile and Ernest Nkankuni, who once turned their backs on the practice and sought refuge in Bulawayo, were among the crop of youths currently being circumcised in Bubi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody forced us back. We realised we needed to be regarded as men among our community,&quot; said Ernest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the popularity of the practice among the Xhosa, health experts discourage it due to the potential danger of spreading infections like sexually transmitted diseases and HIV which causes AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, surgeons Nzombane and Sifungo Ntambo (61) say the double-edged knife, which is not used for anything else, is kept under stringent hygienic conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Circumcision is also expertly done that by the time bleeding begins, the surgeon would have finished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, others are beginning to understand the dangers of HIV/AIDS and now insist on surgeons using different knives.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Some 4,000 Zimbabwean prisoners are to be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">released under a presidential amnesty officially gazetted here Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pardon is expected to reduce the number of inmates in the country's 38 overcrowded prisons from 22,000 to about 18,000.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, President Robert Mugabe has stated that the amnesty does not cover prisoners convicted for murder, armed robbery, rape, car theft or fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also excluded are inmates serving prison sentences for conspiracy or incitement, cultivation, manufacture and possession of dagga (cannibis) and dealing in or importation of cocaine, mandrax and LSD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a government gazette issued on Wednesday, Mugabe said remission of sentence would be granted to those prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment on or before Jan. 31, 1981.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Female prisoners convicted of infanticide as first offenders and sentenced to three years imprisonment or less and who will have served at least one quarter of their term on or before June 29 this year, would also qualify for clemency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, habitual criminals serving an extended prison term, persons who escaped from custody on or before June 29 this year and still at large, and those on bail pending appeal against conviction or sentence, would not be eligible for clemency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imprisonment, however, excludes detention under the defence act which means those serving sentence imposed by a court martial, do not qualify for amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 1993 presidential amnesty reduced the number of prisoners from 21,000 to 16,000, but within 12 months the figure rose to 21,500.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has endorsed the creation of the Community of Portuguese-speaking countries, launched Wednesday in Lisbon by Portugal and six former colonies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a message read to the heads of state of the seven-nation commonwealth, Mayor spoke of the possible advantages of the body saying, &quot;within the framework of a common language and a shared past, Lusophone countries are characterized by geographical and economic diversity which is also their greatest wealth.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For this reason, their joint culture, the only real integrating force, takes on a particularly fundamental role in the way in which these people can integrate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is only from this standpoint that respect for differences, tolerance and mutual understanding can be viewed so as to strengthen peaceful and democratic societies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commonwealth will also lead to &quot;openings in the domain of education, the only activity which can confer on citizens personal autonomy and the ability to direct their lives and destinies,&quot; Mayor added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Education is the apex of an interactive triangle whose sides could be called peace, development and democracy. It is this triangle which is the cornerstone for future generations - that of a culture of tolerance and peace.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commonwealth groups seven countries, on three continents, of some 190 million people who speak Portuguese, the eighth most spoken language in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its headquarters is in Lisbon and seeks to strengthen political, cultural and economic ties with the goal of promoting the development of its Portuguese speaking member countries: Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea- Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal, Sao Tome Principe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - South African President Nelson Mandela, who celebrates his 78th birthday Thursday, has returned from triumphant state visits to England and France where he campaigned for investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a news conference in Pretoria Thursday, the South African leader denied local media reports that the foreign business leaders he had met did not regard South Africa as an ideal investment opportunity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am the person who spoke to business in both countries,&quot; he said, &quot;and their response is a positive one&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also expressed confidence that progress would be made in finalising a trade agreement between South Africa and the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am told by both President Jacques Chirac and Chancellor Helmut Kohl that they are going to take up this matter as one of urgency,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela said he had explained that South Africa was emerging from a long period of tyranny and conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United Kingdom,&quot; he said, &quot;as one of the bastions of democracy has an obligation to ensure that we have all the material means to entrench democracy. I think the people of the United Kingdom understand this request as being reasonable. And it was the same in France.&quot; Referring to the Southern African Development Community, President Mandela said it was important to include all the countries of the region in any EU agreements which offered them trade opportunities. Asked about possible South African involvement in conflict resolution in Africa, President Mandela said &quot;if we are invited by the United Nations or the Organization of African Unity...we will consider it very seriously.&quot; But he emphasized that South Africa would prefer non-military intervention.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said Thursday in Brazzaville that African leaders should stop grabbing power through coups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a session of the Congolese parliament, Chirac said it was high time Africa put an end to putschs, juntas and other manifestations of violent transition to power.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The French leader described such incidents as outdated, humiliating and a step backwards for the people. In addition, he said, they served as pretext for disengagement for the rest of the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chirac said that the future of Africa lies in the utilization of its wisdom, experiences, history and traditional values to invent its own model of democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that it is only by embracing the rule of law that Africa could win the full confidence of the international community. Turning to the Francophone family, the French president proposed the creation of an institute for democracy, which would serve as a tool for analysis and making proposals. Its other duty would be the training of senior personnel who would head modern states. While insisting on the need to respect human rights and free enterprise, Chirac expressed confidence in the future of democracy in Africa &quot;in spite of the errors, failures and catastrophes.&quot; Chirac is expected to leave Congo on Saturday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MONROVIA, Liberia (PANA) - Liberia's civil and traditional leaders have urged strong international sanctions against faction leaders in the country's six-year civil war, to make them comply with the various agreements they have signed to restore peace in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During separate consultations with a Ghana-led delegation of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) on Wednesday, the leaders suggested the setting up of an international war crimes tribunal where the factional leaders would have to clear themselves of any human rights abuses before being eligible to stand for democratic elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation, led by Kojo Tsikata, special envoy and chief peace negotiator of ECOWAS chairman President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana, is on an assessment tour of Liberia to collate views of the various segments of the population on how to put the peace process back on track.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both groups stressed that the West African peacekeeping force, ECOMOG, be empowered and provided with the logistics to enforce peace by deploying throughout Liberia to disarm combatants, as a pre-condition to free and fair elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On no account should there be elections without first complete disarmament, encampment and integration of these combatants into the society,&quot; the chairman of the Liberia Bar Association (LBA), Frederick Cherue, said at the meeting of the civil leaders and the ECOWAS team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group, made up of representatives from the clergy, political parties, students, women's organisations, rights groups and voluntary organisations, among others, further suggested that the international community should ostracise the Liberian war-lords by refusing them entry into any country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They should be subjected by the international community to strict confinement within Liberian borders until they comply with all the commitments they have made concerning the various peace accords before they can travel outside the country,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders appealed to the United Nations, the Organisation of African Unity and ECOWAS, to impose sanctions on the export of any form of natural resources of Liberia &quot;which have been so much plundered to fuel the war machinery in our country to the detriment and impoverishment of our people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation in Liberia is not conducive for elections, as no effective political campaign could be organised because &quot;the war-lords have imposed sanctions on themselves since none of them can enter territory controlled by their rivals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until the situation is effectively defused, there should be no elections, the group stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The traditional rulers urged ECOWAS leaders to beef up ECOMOG, to take full control of the country and restore normalcy &quot;so the people can return to the land to produce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said the warring factions and their leaders have proved incapable of resolving their differences to bring lasting peace to the country and, therefore, force has to be applied to end the senseless conflict for power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The war-lords and combatants are our children. The land belongs to us, but by this senseless war they are depriving us and the people our livelihood.  They must be stopped by all means including force. The pampering must end once and for all,&quot; they pleaded with the delegation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation promised to convey all their concerns and recommendations to the ECOWAS summit for consideration and necessary action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - Following is a statement issued by the American Committee on Africa on behalf of 31 American organizations calling upon Congress to provide &quot;adequate support&quot; for Africa during deliberations on the foreign aid budget:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrating continuing support for Africa, thirty-one prominent women's, civil rights and public policy groups urged the Senate, which is expected to vote on foreign appropriations the week of July 15, to &quot;recognize that Africa matters&quot; by earmarking adequate aid to Africa, as it does to other regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an open letter to the Senate published in Roll Call, the signatories, including Dr. Dorothy Height, Bella Abzug and Rev. Joseph Lowery, protested proposed Congressional cuts in the President's Africa aid budget. The letter, which cites concrete examples of successful U.S. aid programs for African women and children, calls for restoration of funding through the Development Fund for Africa (D.F.A.), a program which guarantees that funds are not used for other regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In spite of claims made by conservative budget cutters, Africa does matter to the American people,&quot; said Jennifer Davis, executive director of The American Committee on Africa (ACOA), which initiated the letter. &quot;There is strong opposition to cuts that impact on poor people at home and abroad.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Black Caucus of State Legislators and the National Caucus of Black Mayors, representing cities and states reeling from federal budget cuts, were among the signatories supporting adequate foreign aid to Africa. Civil rights groups such as the National Urban League and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, led by Rev. Joseph Lowery also joined the protest against proposed Africa aid cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the prominent women's groups and leaders supporting aid to Africa are Dr. Dorothy Height of the National Conference of Negro Women, Bella Abzug, the YWCA, the Coalition of 100 Black Women and the Coalition of Labor Union Women. This strong support from women's groups reflects the growing internationalism of the women's movement coming out of the Beijing Women's Conference and the letter's emphasis on how U.S. aid impacts African women and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Council of Churches, representing thirty-one Protestant denominations, the National Council of Jewish Women, and the Council of Mosques were among other major bodies adding their names to the call for the preservation of the Development Fund for Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress is expected to vote on the Foreign Operations Bill during the week of July 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Text of the 'Open Letter to the Senate,' entitled &quot;SAVE U.S. AID TO AFRICA&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year US aid will help millions of African families build better lives.  Forty-five thousand rural families in South Africa will have better water and sanitation. Thousands of children in Malawi and Uganda will attend primary schools for the first time. Women in Kenya will benefit from family planning.  Reforestation efforts by Senegalese women will improve the living standards of their families. Other programs will strengthen Africa's emerging democracies and democratic institutions.  We believe that these programs are vital to the development of Africa, the poorest and most under-developed continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Development Fund for Africa (DFA) was created to ensure that this essential funding for sustainable development projects in Africa is not shifted to other regions or projects. This is why President Clinton proposed the restoration of the DFA in his foreign aid budget for Fiscal Year 97.  We reject the decision by the House of Representatives to slash funding to Africa and eliminate funding to the DFA. We further criticize their decision not to earmark funds to Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Senate meets to discuss appropriations for foreign aid, we urge you to support aid to Africa. We call on the Senate to support the President's aid allocation to Africa and the preservation of the Development Fund for Africa. We believe justice demands that funds to Africa be guaranteed, as they are for other regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We urge you to recognize that Africa matters. Many millions of Americans wish to see it provided with adequate support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The signatories include:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabwe - Red locusts have invaded parts of Lukanga Swamps feeding on reeds and green grass, Central Province Agricultural Officer, Jonestone Chintu confirmed in Kabwe today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chintu also said that the International Red Locusts Control Organisation for East and Southern Africa headquarters based in Ndola have found clusters of the dreaded insects around the swamp in Chibombo district during their aerial survey using helicopters this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chintu who collected samples of live and dead red locusts from Lukanga Swamp yesterday appealed to the people not to panic as the situation was under close surveillance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He, however, said that the swarm did not pose any danger to crops and they concentrated on feeding green vegetation growing in the swamp area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked what measures should be taken to clear the red locusts, Mr Chintu said that the decision would be taken after his report to the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He, however, said that either aerial or manual spraying would be effected, but human beings and animals should be removed from the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If spraying from the air will be conducted, we shall need maximum cooperation from the local people to move their animals from the area and not to catch any locusts for food or sale outside because these insects will be poisonous,&quot; Mr Chintu explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tourism Minister, Mr Gabriel Maka who is Kapiri-Mposhi Member of Parliament last week announced the presence of swarms of red locusts in his constituency and appealed to the department of agriculture to monitor the insects before they could cause damage to the crops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Villagers around the swamp said the outbreak of locusts in their areas was a blessing because they earned income from the sale of the delicious insects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Kapukupuku village, on the shores of the swamp, village headman James Mumba popularly known as 'Liwewe' (after popular Zambian soccer commentator) said that the red locusts started appearing in March this year but never destroyed any crops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mumba said &quot;red locusts have been present in the area since last year and people from as far as the Copperbelt and Lusaka provinces come to catch them for their relish and sale to earn income,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He explained thaat the red locusts were seasonal covering some 30 to 50 kilometres of the swamp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Albina Chishala, a house-wife who settled in the area in 1969, said that the grasshoppers were of two types -- the green ones which invade the area in March and the red type which starts in June.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - Politics again dominated editorial commentary in parts of the continent this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Lagos, Nigeria, the semi-official Daily Times described the OAU summit held in Yaounde, Cameroon from July 8 to 10 as one of the most successful in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said the summit's support for Boutros Boutros-Ghali's bid for a second term as United Nations Secretary General, in the face of United States opposition, was honourable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Egyptian, it said, had done well for Africa in his first term and deserved another.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newspaper however, asked why the South African president, Nelson Mandela, had left the summit prematurely for state visits to Britain and France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Shouldn't the discussion of Africa's pressing problems have taken precedence over Mandela's dining and wining with British royalty ?&quot; it asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Vanguard, a private paper published in Lagos, stayed closer to home. It urged Nigerians to pay greater heed to the American ambassador's calls for the restoration of democracy in the West African state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. Carrington's comments on the occasion of the 220th anniversary of American independence (July 4) were frank, candid and friendly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He spoke of the need for the military to respect democratic institutions by sticking to its task of defending the country,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He spoke of the need to allow that essential and vital ingredient of democracy -- the right of the people to choose who will govern them and how.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. Carrington also canvassed the release of all political detainees saying that he would have been happier if the likes of Gani Fawehinmi, Femi Falana and Beko Ransome Kuti (political activists) were around to be part of the celebrations. &quot;We share the sentiments of Mr. Carrington and agree with his weighty pronouncements on the social and political situation in Nigeria,&quot; the Vanguard said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Senegal, the privately-owned Wal Fadjri was critical of Niger's July 7 and 8 presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said the dismissal of the country's independent election commission during the polls -- and a rushed appointment of a hand-picked one by government -- had been a serious breech of normal election procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wal Fadjri said the move by the military leader, Gen. Ibrahim Bare Mainassara, also a presidential candidate, had raised suspicions of fraud.  The general was later declared winner by an overwhelming majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The general's style is disturbing, not so much for its brutality, but for its blatancy. He did not need open and fair elections supervised by the independent commission. The polls were nothing more than a formality, a costly one, designed to dress a regime born of a military coup in the garb of popular legitimacy and legality,&quot; the newspaper said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sud, another privately owned Senegalese daily, was less compromising. It described Gen. Mainassara's action as theft (&quot;hold-up&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It had become clear, the newspaper said, that the Gen. had never been committed to free elections and had allowed their organization only after pressure from donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And when the election was turning against him, our general turned to a hasty dissolution of the electoral commission and designated a new one made up of his supporters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said the general had managed to break a general strike called to protest his action by paying salary arrears owed by the state on the same day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, the man who came in under the pretext of saving (Niger's) democracy, 'derailed by the infantilism of the country's leaders', is in reality its principal saboteur,&quot; Sud said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Burundi, the proposal for a multinational peace-keeping force to restore order in the tiny central African state, remained a violent issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">La Balance, a weekly linked to the powerful Tutsi minority, expressed its firm opposition to the force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said the force, designed to prevent the type of genocide witnessed in Rwanda in neighboring Burundi, would be fought to the bitter end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a question of dying with our arms in our hands. It means Burundians will not accept foreign armies (the peacekeeping force) coming in to destroy the nation,&quot; the paper said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government-owned Le Renouveau du Burundi took a different view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said the force would halt the killings in Burundi, and help restore peace and order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The daily said the decision to send in the force had been taken by neighboring African heads of state who had thorough knowledge of what was going on in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We feel that in the current conditions of war...Burundi's armed forces are incapable of stopping the massacres&quot; taking place in the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - A southern African regional office of theinternational policing organisation, Interpol, was opened in Harare on Friday, just months before the Southern African Development Community (SADC) free movement protocol agreement is effected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A rise in crime is anticipated when the 12 SADC member states relax travel regulations and open their borders to nationals of member states.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home Affairs Minister, Dumiso Dabengwa, said the establishment of an Interpol sub-regional office would help member states cope with cross-border crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Free movement of people in the region will be a big challenge for the sub- regional office as we await the ratification of the protocol by the end of the year,&quot; said Dabengwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SADC region has become a haven for criminal activities such as car theft, drug trafficking and use of fraudulent travel documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As our countries continue to strengthen their economies, we must at the same time underscore the point that without security, stability and prosperity within the region, there can be no socio-economic development,&quot; said Dabengwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The free movement protocol is scheduled to be effected by the end of the year, after heads of state ratify it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interpol has 176 member countries in different continents and the Harare office becomes the second such in Africa after Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation, the second largest after the United Nations, uses its information network to trace and apprehend international criminals.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwe's Lands and Water Resources Minister Kumbirai Kangai said on Friday the British government has agreed to fund the country's land resettlement program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kangai told a news conference that he, together with the minister for local government, rural and urban development, John Nkomo, had met British Overseas Development Minister Baroness Lynda Chalker early this month and she had reaffirmed her government's commitment to the program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our mission to London was successful because we wanted the British government to recommit their earlier commitment in 1979 at the Lancaster House Conference on facilitating the (land) resettlement program,&quot; said Kangai.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as he was addressing the news conference, British High Commissioner Martin Williams was telling a Zimbabwe Inter-Africa News Agency (ZIANA) reporter that his government will not provide new aid for the land redistribution program unless the Zimbabwean government acquires land on the principle of willing seller-willing buyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to continue to believe that any money on land must be on willing seller basis. It's something that we have made clear to government throughout.  ..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have confirmed our own willingness to provide assistance to the land issue provided under the context of a satisfactory policy framework. We have proposed the idea of a roundtable conference to enable interested parties to join and some donors to contribute to the cost of the program,&quot; said Williams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimbabwe government needs about Zimdollars 1 billion (USD 100 million) to resettle over 80 000 families, 20 percent of whom have to be liberation war veterans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A large portion of the land is to be taken, with compensation, from white commercial farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe passed the land acquisition act of 1992 which enables the government to designate and acquire farms it wants to resettle millions of its landless people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The land acquisition policy has been heavily criticized, especially by Zimbabwe's white commercial farmers who occupy about 70 percent of Zimbabwe's arable land.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - Direct foreign investment in South Africa during the past two years has exceeded initial projections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The boost in foreign investment is revealed in the latest report of Business Map South Africa, a local publication which focuses on business intelligence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report says that actual and intended direct foreign investment in South Africa, since the 1994 general elections which ushered majority rule in the country, amounted to more than 4 billion U.S. dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figure exceeded provisional estimates of between 2.3 billion and 3.75 billion dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States has been the leading investor in the country, far ahead of more traditional trading partners like Germany and Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American investments since 1994 exceed 1.8 billion dollars -- more than double that of Germany, which ranks second with 730 million dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Kingdom comes a distant third with 525 million dollars, followed by such other countries as Malaysia, Korea, Switzerland, France, Austria, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also reveals that the dominant sector for foreign investment was that of food and beverages, which alone attracted 1.2 billion dollars. Other major fields of foreign investment were motors and components, electronics and information, and hotels and leisure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 45 investment portfolio from 10 new companies were focusing on the manufacturing sector. Thirty British companies were concentrating in the fields of engineering, telecommunications, oil, energy, chemicals and publishing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - A highly significant round of discussions between South Africa and Germany will take place here, later this month, on the important issue of future trade relations between Europe and Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The German embassy in Pretoria has announced that German Deputy-Chancellor Klaus Kinkel will meet with President Nelson Mandela to discuss future links between the European Community and the 12-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kinkel will be in South Africa from July 23 to 25, as part of a four-nation tour of southern Africa. He will also visit Botswana, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, the German embassy said in a statement, released here on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the statement, Kinkel will hold top-level meeting in all four countries. These discussions will concentrate on regional co-operation within the framework of SADC, as well as co-operation between SADC and the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his return from state visits to England and France earlier this week, Mandela was confident that progress would be made in settling a trade agreement between the union and South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he emphasised the importance of ensuring that any such agreement would include the other eleven members of SADC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent report by one of the region's largest banks, Standard Chartered Bank, expressed the view that South Africa and Zimbabwe would provide the engine for future economic growth in southern Africa. It said southern Africa was entering a decade of strong economic growth and a better outlook than it had experienced in the last three decades</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg -On Sunday South African swimmer Penny Heyns will finally know whether all the sacrifices and hard work of the past four years have been worthwhile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last time she appeared at the Olympic Games, her presence as an up-and- coming 17-year-old was heavily criticised by the South African media because she failed to win the national trials. That pressure saw her perform disappointingly to finish 32nd in her favoured 100m breaststroke event and 33rd over 200m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now there is only adulation and a different kind of pressure as she goes into the most important race of her career as the clear favourite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Barcelona Heyns took stock of her situation and decided that if she was going to improve and make an impact in Atlanta, she would have to relocate to America. That led to her 1993 move to Nebraska University where several South Africans already in residence and the quiet small town life of Lincoln, made it easy to adjust.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She teamed up with former Czech swimmer Jan Bidrman who represented Sweden in the individual medley at Barcelona and a close bond quickly formed between them. &quot;It is their relationship, even more so than Penny's talent and Jan's knowledge, which is probably the biggest factor in Penny's success story.  They have a very close working relationship and complete confidence in one another's ability,&quot; says Nebraska's head swimming coach Cal Bentz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was very lucky when I started coaching Penny because she was already a very accomplished swimmer,&quot; says Bidrman. &quot;My plan was to give her a little more training every year so that she progressed steadily. In South Africa she only swam once a day and did less than 3 000m. Now she swims about nine times a week and does around 6 000m a session,&quot; reveals Bidrman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gym work too has played its role. As a top American football college -- Nebraska has won the national title for the past two years -- there are good weight room facilities and a team of experts to provide assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every year I would do something different with my weight training and I didn't really know what worked best for me. After nationals in Durban this year, I went onto a programme which was specially designed for me and it appears to have made a difference,&quot; says Heyns, who has been swimming the fastest training times of her career since she started cutting back on her programme four weeks ago to be ready for the Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For technique, Bidrman subscribes to the methods of the Hungarian school of swimming, and in particular those of renowned former champion Josef Nagy who coached the men's 200m breaststroke world record- holder Mike Barrowman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I looked at her stroke there were certain things I tried to emphasise, &quot; says Bidrman. He prefers a very narrow, quick kicking action and had her hold a buoy between her knees to practise the required style. He also made her look down in the water while swimming instead of forwards, and encouraged her to swim on top of the water rather than to be submerged. More strength from weight training has also meant a better push-off from the wall at the turns which, combined with improved streamlining after her push-off, has also contributed to her lower times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heyns' form is such that she doesn't need to worry too much about what her rivals are doing. &quot;You can't influence what others are doing. You must just focus on what you are doing yourself. I will just go out to swim my best and hopefully, if I do that, then things should go well,&quot; says Heyns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although winning the gold medal is her primary aim, the world record could also topple once more. &quot;As far as times are concerned a lot of it is mental.  If you decide that you can no longer improve on your best then it's time to give up, but right now I know I can break the record again,&quot; says Heyns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As reigning world record holder it might seem like a race between Heyns and the clock for the Olympic title, but she is not likely to have it so easy.  Samantha Riley is still a formidable foe despite her setbacks of the last year and Heyns is unlikely to disregard her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At last year's major meeting, the Pan Pacifics in Atlanta, Riley was robbed of the chance of going head to head with Heyns in her favourite distance after being disqualified in her heat for what officials described as &quot;a consistent use of a downward dolphin kick over the last 25m&quot;. It was a strange pronouncement and Riley has refused to alter her style.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But although she bounced back to take the 200m in a time of 2:24.81 -- five hundredths away from the world record -- and record the fastest relay split ever with a 1:07.19 for the breaststroke leg of the medley relay, the worst was still to come. At the world short course championships in Rio de Janeiro last December, in a 25m pool -- as opposed to a 50m pool -- temporarily constructed on Copacabana, she won the 100m and 200m breaststroke events in world record times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few weeks later, however, it was announced that she had tested positive for an illegal substance at the meeting and she faced the very real prospect of being banned during the Olympic Games. The world governing body was lenient though and she escaped punishment. It believed she did not intend to cheat by taking a headache pill containing a stimulant, but her coach was banned for two years for giving the tablet to her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 23-year-old Riley, who is two years older than Heyns, seemed to be affected by these traumas at the Australian trials in April. She failed to win either event but made the team by finishing second in both with times that would not make Heyns lose any sleep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other main medal prospect is America's Amanda Beard who finished third behind Heyns at last year's Pan Pacifics as a 13-year-old, and was always going to be a handful as she got older. The Chinese, too, have a newcomer to their ranks after their doping scandal of 1994, but 15-year-old Han Xue -- who broke the short course world record for 50m breaststroke twice earlier this year -- is yet to prove herself in the 100m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heyns will be aiming for a split at the halfway stage of around 31.8 seconds compared with her time at the same stage in her world record swim of 32.19, but if she should go on to win, political naivety could spoil her big day. A springbok tattoo on her shoulder is sure to solicit a barrage of probing questions from the world's media eager for an interesting angle on her story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although she may claim that she can't see what all the fuss is about and repeat that age-old adage that sport and politics don't mix, it was interesting to see the reactions from both sides of the fence. Nocsa played it diplomatically and refused to be drawn into the debate, while the white media reiterated Heyns' feelings and seemed to support them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only black journalist covering the Games said Heyns had gone out of control, while a far from political black team member said, &quot;You don't do something like that if you want the respect of the whole nation. I believe that some people back home will be glad if she loses now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - With the Centennial Games opening on Friday, Mick Cleary and Kevin Mitchell come up with the low-down on the Olympics, alphabetically speaking, from Athens to Zero</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ATHENS. Birthplace - of the Olympics (but passed over for these Centennial Games) -- and birthplace, in Georgia, of Billy Payne, the real estate lawyer who brought the Games to Atlanta. &quot;I feel sorry for Athens,&quot; Payne said when he returned from Greece with the Olympic Flame. But with a smile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BASKETBALL. Did you know that China has the biggest player in the women's tournament? She is known as the Honey Monster, all 2,5m of her. The best, though, is widely regarded as the 2,3m American model Lisa Leslie. &quot;These bones,&quot; she says, &quot;they kind of fool people. I'm small, but I'm going to be out there mixing it up.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COMPLAINTS. Despite every effort, there will be plenty over the next few weeks. The heat, transport, accommodation, water, tickets ... Frank Deford of Newsweek, who has just returned from covering Wimbledon, thinks the European press are spoiling for a fight. &quot;They're already sharpening their knives,&quot; he told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. &quot;They're going to rip you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEFECTIONS. The two Cuban boxers, followed last Thursday by the country's best baseball pitcher and with four more rumoured to be hovering near the wire, are the sad face of the Games. Uncle Sam seems to be revelling, as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ENERGY. A key factor in performances in Atlanta will be the athletes' capacity for work. Ironically, some experts here think the track at the Olympic Stadium is a record-breaking fast one -- if the athletes can stand up to the energy-sapping conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FLAME. The story of the Olympic Flame really started in dubious celebration of supposed Aryan superiority at the 1936 Games in Berlin. It has come full circle for one veteran Olympian. Paul DeBruyn competed in the marathon for Germany in 1932 and 1936, even though he was then living in the United States.  Hitler asked him to stay in Germany. He declined. Last week when the Flame reached Daytona Beach, DeBruyn, 88 and now an American citizen, was there to celebrate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GAYS. Atlanta will be the first Olympic city to host a hospitality suite for homosexuals -- although it took heavy lobbying to overcome earlier prejudices, as well as a few commercial truths. As the mayor's special adviser, Phil McDonald, says: &quot;A lot of gay tourists will be coming to the Olympics because of their disposable income.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HEAT. The word you will be hearing more often than not over the next few weeks, apart from humidity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INFORMATION. Another commodity of which there is no shortage. Info 96, called up on small screens all over the Olympic village, is the technological link between the eternally curious and the trivial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOKES. Who is going to carry the Flame into Atlanta? Anyone, as long as he's not called Sherman. How would Michael Buffer announce the Olympics? &quot; Let's get ready to grumble!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KNOWHOW. What Americans used to be known for. It will take all they have to overcome the logistical problems that Atlanta presents. Indications are they're getting there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LOCALS. Here is what some Atlantans are saying about the Olympics in the local paper -- &quot;The Olympics are here, and still no toilets. Visitors will remember the Atlanta smell.&quot; &quot;The Olympics is like a hurricane: it's coming, we're not ready for it and we can't stop it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MONEY. After heat, the word that most concerns the organisers. Estimates that the Games would bring spin-off billions to the city were said last week to be about $1-billion short. But advertising is booming. An adland expert said the Games &quot;could usher in the most colossal, concentrated three-week advertising blitz in Madison Avenue history&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NIGHTMARE. They call it the Dream Team, but, for Charles Barkley, these Olympics have turned sour before they even start. The star basketball player is alleged to have assaulted 23-year-old Jeb Tyler in a Cleveland bar last weekend. Barkley says he was provoked and Tyler, who is considering later civil proceedings, says he will not press criminal charges. &quot;I don't want to see Charles Barkley get arrested and detained for this,&quot; he said. &quot;He would have to come back to Cleveland and get arraigned in two weeks. He'd miss the Olympics.&quot; What a neat guy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OVERKILL. If you do not know which American soft drink has its HQ in Atlanta you will soon never be allowed to forget it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PALESTINIANS. Their last appearance was a tragic one, in 1972, when terrorists killed 11 Israeli athletes. Abu Marahil, one member of their three- man team (they have two runners and a boxer), says: &quot;We were at war then. Now is a new day and the Palestinian people and the Israeli people must learn to live together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTIONS. What journalists were unable to ask the IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch when he arrived at the Olympic village last Thursday.  Rarely can so many hacks have tried so hard to get so close to someone they distrust so much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ROYALS. Di won't be here (although she thought about it), but Anne will.  The Princess Royal, feeding American hunger Britain's tattered old monarchy, was the crowd-puller at a charity dinner for Georgia's upwardly grovelling on Tuesday. Just $1 000 a ticket. It was a &quot;frocks-and-rocks&quot; do, as Anne's lady- in-waiting calls it. Last week it was Prince Albert of Monaco, tres downmarket though, with tickets going for as little as $100.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOCCER. A key organiser of the tournament will be ex-Aston Villa player Phil Woosnam (a distant cousin of golfer Ian), who is the deputy competition manager. Woosnam, who has been here since his time with the doomed North American Soccer League 13 years ago and coached the Atlanta Chiefs, will retire after seeing Atlanta through. He has picked up plenty of American. &quot; The warmth of the people of the South,&quot; he says, &quot;and the beauty of all the trees -- that was the first thing that impacted me when I came.&quot; Enjoy, Phil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TECHNOLOGY. These will be the highest of hi-tech Games. IBM has sponsored a worldwide web site -- which is http://www.atlanta. olympic.org. Traffic is heavy, up from 50 000 hits a day to more than seven million. The internal TV- computer network is called Scarlet -- after O'Hara. Atlanta is the home of BellSouth and Atlantans will be left a legacy of hundreds of thousands of miles of fibre-optic wiring: one of the reasons Atlanta got the Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNITED STATES. If anything unites this country it is the chance to prove they can put on a show. For all the doomsaying, the Games are likely to go smoothly because of the co-ordination of services and security. &quot;See that panhandler?&quot; a cop pointed out the other day. &quot;He's security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VICTORY. The biggest victory of these Olympics will be an incident-free tournament. Don't bet on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WOMEN. There will be 39% more women competing here than in Barcelona, the best representation at the Olympics. All first-time sports must now include both sexes. This time it is mountainbiking and beach volleyball. But Gwen Torrance, twice a gold medal winner, points out: &quot;Oh no, when you think of sport, you think of men. We've come a long way, but we've got a long way to go.&quot; There were no women at the 1896 Games, 1 058 by 1952 and here there will be 3 779.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">X-CHROMOSOME. Not everything is as gender-specific as it might seem. Dora Ratjen, fourth in the high jump in 1936, later admitted her name was Herman.  She claimed she was ordered to pose as a woman by the Nazis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">YOUTH or Yuk. The organisers hit the yuk button in a big way when they invented a wacky character called Izzy as the Games mascot, complete with imbecilic fantasy story. It has been rightly lampooned and ignored by the little folk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZERO. The chance most people give those playing the Dream Team. &quot;We'll cover them like we did in Barcelona -- for the first 15 or 20 minutes,&quot; says NBC's sports president Dick Ebersol. &quot;If it becomes non-competitive, we'll return for the end of the game.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - After a seven-week shoot, a wrap party for &quot;Fools,&quot; a co- production between France, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, the SABC, M-Net and our Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, was held in Johannesburg last week. And, insobrieties aside, everyone was happy with the results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on a short story from the award-winning collection by Njabulo Ndebele, the film tells the tale of a schoolteacher, Zamani (played by Patrick Shai), who falls foul of the community in Charterstown township when he's found molesting young girls.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the girls' brothers, Zani, played by Hlomla Dandala (a newcomer from Wits University's drama school), sets out to challenge the teacher. Through the course of the narrative, their roles slowly reverse. And, while the young man begins to stray from the path, the older man slowly regains some of his dignity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The story was adapted for film by Bhekisiswe Petersen, and within industry circles it has been suggested that the script is a bit flimsy. But Mozambican- based producer Pedro Pimenta flatly counters such talk. &quot;We knew what we were going to do with it,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the fact that it's an apartheid story, the film-makers are adamant that they have a new take on the race saga. This, they say, is not your standard South African movie where all the blacks are good and all the whities bad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Script supervisor Maureen Conway concurs: &quot;The movie has an interesting local feel. It's not political per se, but rather a story about someone touched by politics.&quot; This is reflected in director Ramedan Suleman's treatment, which, according to Conway, &quot;concentrates as much on atmosphere as on drama&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, Fools is being shot as an art movie, and a major bonus in this regard is the presence of cinematographer Jacques Boquin, who has shot over 100 documentaries and several art pictures, including those of Raul Ruiz, the Chilean-born director based in France who makes films teeming with surrealist imagery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local actor Robin Smith claims that, in the past, he was considered too ugly to play fascists; now, in the new South Africa, he's only being cast as cops or AWB members. True to this paradox, he appears in Fools as a sjambok- wielding bad guy, absolved because the community wants his victim, the schoolteacher, to be punished. An ironic take on apartheid, executed in an artistic fashion ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I visited the set a fortnight ago to witness a high-school scene straight out of Sarafina!, I was struck by the multi-lingual babble on set.  Here's a South African movie where they shout &quot;Coupe!&quot; instead of &quot;Cut!&quot;; where most of the communication between director and crew is in French.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a sign of the times: almost all of our local movies are currently being financed or produced by outsiders (Britain's Channel Four paid for Les Blair's Babel; Jean Delbeke is rumoured to have a movie in the pipeline, partially financed by the Flemish).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When are people like Edgar Bold, perhaps the most powerful independent producer in the country, going to wake up and smell the potential of films that don't just focus on the antics of Mr Safe/Mr Schlock, Leon Schuster?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Japan will not release any fresh aid to Zambia until the government renews its commitment to good governance, counsellor Takayaki Miyashita disclosed on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counsellor Miyashita, in an exclusive interview in Lusaka on Friday, said the recent release of K16 billion should not be taken for granted by the Zambian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope the country will not misunderstand our voice just as expressed by other donor nations,&quot; Miyashita said. &quot;At this stage there is no slash of Japan aid which has already been signed but if the current situation goes on and does not come to an end then we may have to think twice.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counsellor Miyashita added: &quot;Our embassy has met President Chiluba and his finance minister Ronald Penza on several occasions and we have emphasised that they should resume dialogue with the opposition but unfortunately there has been no positive response up to now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But President Chiluba's press aide, Richard Sakala, reiterated that donor nations have to respect recipient nations' sovereignty and rebuffed claims that there was no dialogue between government and the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No government should prescribe conditions on another government,&quot; Sakala said in an interview on Friday at Lusaka's Chipata Compound Health Clinic where President Chiluba was launching the Polio National Immunisation Days (NID's).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This government is democratically elected and works on the basis of popular mandate of the people of Zambia,&quot; Sakala said. &quot;The government is ready for dialogue. In fact there is a lot of dialogue because all parties are talking on all issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But counsellor Miyashita maintained the MMD government has violated a cardinal condition of &quot;good governance&quot; which is the basic benchmark for any aid from Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The purpose of our aid and projects is to better the life of the ordinary people and we have not changed our policy but unfortunately at the moment there is no positive and better direction towards democracy and good governance,&quot; Miyashita said. &quot;Governance is our greatest concern. We understand and appreciate the stand most donor countries have taken. We don't want to apply double standards to our recipient countries but if the situation goes to worse we just have to apply stronger measures to this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Party Lusaka Province chairman, Johnson Nzima, welcomed counsellor Miyashita's statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The MMD government can only be moved by donor pressure,&quot; Nzima said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finance minister Ronald Penza in an interview on Friday refused to comment on the development until the Japanese government gives him an official stand on their donor aid flow to Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Japan last week Friday signed a Grant Assistance for Grass Roots Project with the Association to Aid the Refugees (AAR) at Maheba Refugee Camp in North Western Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grant which was signed on behalf of the Japanese government by counsellor Miyashita is worth $153,032 and will be utilised on three projects - a Water Project ($44,862), the Improvement of Agricultural and Livestock Farming Project ($22,751) and the Health Improvement Project ($85, 419) with which to procure a generator, a refrigerator, medicines and a 4 WD motor vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Japanese Grant Assistance for Grass Roots Project, under whose umbrella this grant falls, was first introduced in Zambia in 1990. This type of assistance is designed to promote development activities of NGOs, schools, hospitals and local communities at grass roots level,&quot; counsellor Miyashita said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counsellor Miyashita also said he was happy to assist Maheba Refugee Camp through AAR, which provides quite a number of unfortunate people with a roof over their heads and nourishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;AAR is active in allowing the refugees in the camp the opportunity of employment, education, vocational training for self-reliance, as well as looking after their health needs, thus giving them the opportunity to enjoy a normal daily life whilst away from their home environment,&quot; counsellor Miyashita said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And receiving the grant on behalf of AAR, Kenji Hayasaka said the refugees had suffered of a chronic shortage of drugs and hoped the grant would help reduce their suffering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hayasaka however, said with the signing of the Lusaka Protocol the situation had improved because most Angolan refugees who made up 90 per cent of the 33,000 at Maheba had been repatriated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mkushi - Thirty-three women groups with a membership of five hundred and ten in Mkushi have this year produced about 9.2 tonnes of maize from the two hundred and thirty hectares they had cultivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mkushi women development co-ordinating committee chairperson Ms Patricia Nalishuwa said in Mkushi that apart from maize production the women groups had also cultivated ten hectares of commercial sunflower, two hectares of groundnut seed, five hectares of pumpkin seed, one hectare of beans seed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Mkushi district co-operative union spent fifty million kwacha on women for the cultivation of two hundred and thirty hectares of maize, while Zambia Co-operative Federation and AFRICARE loaned the women thirty million kwacha for the production of pumpkins, beans, groundnut seed and commercial sunflower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said maize for the women groups would be bought by Mkushi district co- operative union at fifteen thousand kwacha per ninety kilogram bag while sunflower will be bought by AFRICARE while the other crop seed would be bought by ZAMSEED.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the women groups in Mkushi do not desert and they would repay the loans to the lending insdtitutions because she has already taught them on the importance of paying back loans.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Zambia and Zaire have committed themselves are to take urgent measures aimed at combating crime that is prevalent at their common border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a joint-communique signed in Lusaka today at the end of a two-day meetings between the deputy minister of foreign affairs, Dr Peter Machungwa and his Zairean counterpart Lokondo Yoka, the two countries will from now onwards deal seriously with cross-border motor vehicle thefts and armed banditry by providing necessary information about known criminals to police of each other who may be harbouring in either country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two governments will also ensure that timely information especially on transit times of cargo to various destinations and security is provided to curb thefts of minerals like cobalt and copper.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Copper thieves and those of cobalt will be treated like common motor vehicle bandits and these will be prosecuted within the applicable laws of the both countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stolen goods will, when recovered, be handed back to the rightful owners once recovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia and Zaire have for a long time been experiencing thefts of minerals and motor vehicles from either sides especially in border towns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the signing of the joint communique Dr Machungwa described the two- day meetings with Mr Yoka as succesful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the outcome of the meeting will help curb the crime in the both countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Mr Yoka expressed happiness in that they managed to put in place legal and diplomatic instruments that will end smuggling in both countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Zairean community will be informed that Zambian authorities will no longer accept goods impounded or stolen from Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Dr Machungwa has said Zambia and Zaire share common ties which must be strengthened in order that misunderstandings are avoided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the two countries were both members of the Organisation of African Unity, United Nations and COMESA which must strengthen their resolve to work closely together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia and Zaire shared common poverty levels, long geographical ties and economic problems that threaten to derail meaningful cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Machungwa was speaking at a dinner he hosted for his Zairean counterpart Mr Lokondo Yoka at Hotel Intercontinental in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called on the two countries to work towards lessening cross border crimes which included thefts of copper from Zambia and cobalt from Zaire in order to improve the welfare of the two peoples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said enhanced economic cooperation would lead to success of both countries' development programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the political front Dr Machungwa noted that Zaire had contributed to peace in the region and cited the 1993 when President Mobutu sese Seko brokered the Angola peace talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Zaire had made sacrifices on the Rwanda and Burundi conflicts by accepting more than 2 million refugees who migrated from horrors brought about by warring factions there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Zairean deputy foreign affairs minister, Yoka said trade relations, economic ties and security must be strengthened as these were the connerstones of democracy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Senior officials of the Zimbabwe Tobacco Association (ZTA) met President Robert Mugabe on Monday, amidst growing concern of their members about a 10 percent tobacco levy imposed on growers and merchants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliament recently passed a bill enabling treasury to collect the levies, through which government expects to earn about 700 million zimdollars (70 million US dollars) annually. Controversy then followed the levy on the export crop which is expected to earn the country more than 7 billion zimdollars (700 million US dollars) this year, with the farmers saying their viability would be threatened while the government said it needed the revenue to boost its finances.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZTA President, Rob Webb, and his deputy, Richard Tate, had a lunch time meeting with Mugabe at his Zimbabwe House offices in Harare, where the issues came up for discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting was also attended by agriculture minister, Denis Norman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The five percent levy is going to have a severe effect on us,&quot; said Webb, who added that as a result of the levies, tobacco prizes had fallen by 18.4 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said small-scale farmers would be the worst affected by the levy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we fear (for) most of all, is the small-scale tobacco farmer. They have had dry weather for many years and now they are going to suffer the most, &quot; Webb said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of Zimbabwe's 7,000 small-scale tobacco farmers rely entirely on the crop for their families' upkeep, with some grossing as little as 10,000 zimdollars (1,000 USD) a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Webb said although it was now too late to scrap the levy, the president had hinted he would speak to the minister of finance to see if the situation could be reviewed for the 1997 marketing season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mugabe described the meeting as &quot;cordial&quot;. &quot;It has been a very good meeting, very frank and cordial,&quot; Mugabe said without elaborating.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) - President Omar El-Bashir on Monday officially launched Sudan's first oil refinery, located 600 kms west of the capital Khartoum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a ceremony speech broadcast live on Radio Omdurman, Bashir said the refinery was established even as the country's funds were being withheld in foreign capitals.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plant started trial operations Sunday, processing 5,000 barrels per day.  The quantity will rise to some 10,000 barrels per day of crude brought in from the Higlig oilfield in the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;God has assisted us when others turned their backs on us,&quot; Bashir told the crowd in a speech broadcast live by the state-run radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sudan News Agency, (SUNA), said the refinery will provide 10 percent of the country's Benzine needs, six percent of its gazoline consumption, and 70 percent of other fuel imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan spends 360 million dollars on imports of petroleum products annually, usually at concessional prices from the Gulf states, especially Saudi Arabia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the oil-rich kingdom stopped the assistance after it accused Khartoum of supporting the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait which sparked the 1991 Gulf War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, the government announced a hike in the price of petroleum products by 50 to 60 percent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Africa's poor food security situation will not be improved by increasing land under agriculture, but by developing technologies that enhance soil fertility, Zimbabwe's agriculture minister Denis Norman said here Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said because of the harsh production environment characterised by low fertility and fragile soils for thousands of Zimbabwe's small-scale farmers, use of fertiliser and other agro-chemicals should be increased.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a week-long Southern African regional workshop on agri-inputs, marketing and extension, which opened inHarare today, Norman said food was likely to become more scarce and expensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workshop, being attended by smallholder farmers drawn from the 12- nation Southern African Development Community (SADC), weeks to increase the participants' knowledge and skills of the role of plant nutrients in crop production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Area expansion has been the conventional way of increasing output but because of population pressure, this is becoming difficult...Thus the most viable option is the development and adoption of technological innovation,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Southern African states have in recent years relied on food imports to supplement local stocks that have clearly been inadequate to cater for the rapidly growing population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to estimates of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), only 24 percent of future food needs can be met by putting new land into production, the remaining 76 percent has to come from intensification of production on currently farmed land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Zimbabwe for instance, maize yields in the smallholder farming sector averaged two tonnes per hectare compared to about seven tonnes in the large scale commercial sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's inability to produce enough food for her people has been attributed to recurrent droughts, land degradation and falling investments in agricultural research and production.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUJUMBURA, Burundi (Pana) - The chairman of the Unity for National Progress (Uprona) led by Charles Mukasi said Monday in Bujumbura that the party has decided to withdraw its support for President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I cannot publicly here tell you the methods considered by my party on the issue, but trust me, it is just a matter of days&quot;, he told thousands of angry students demonstrating at the party headquarters over the murder of 30 people (Tutsi) by Hutu militia at the week-end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of people sustained injuries, some serious, in the raid on Saturday by the Hutu militias, according to hospital sources.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The students' representative, Oscar Nyandwi, in an interview, said Uprona &quot; must withdraw its support to president Ntibantunganya and force him to leave&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is the present head of state who is responsible for the insecurity currently prevailing in the country. At least he has proven himself to be incapable of restoring peace and security&quot;, Nyandwi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts say opposition to the authority of the president and the prime minister poses a serious threat to the 1994 pact signed by all parties, and which has so far made it possible to run public institutions in a country bristling with ethnic hatred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, Uprona urged &quot;followers, friendly political parties and all Burundians&quot; to observe three days of mourning starting Monday, for the people killed in the raid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uprona also accused the ruling Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU) led by President Sylvestre Bantunganya, a Hutu, of complicity in the massacres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the government has since declared one week of national mourning in memory of the 304 victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, humanitarian organizations reported the killing of 300 civilians in operations launched by the regular army, at Mutoyi near Bugendana. Some suspect Saturday's killings were a revenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The escalation of violence comes at a time when the international community is supporting the initiative by Burundi's neighbors to send troops to the country for possible intervention should violence erupt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi has been torn by a war between the majority Hutu population and the minority Tutsi, who nonetheless, control the army, since the assassination in October 1993 of President Melchior Ndadaye (a Hutu) in an aborted military coup.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - The United States has agreed to play a significant role in a new four-million-dollar project in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under an agreement, the United States Trade and Development Agency (TDA), will contribute 800,000 dollars to South Africa's Industrial Development Corporation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The funds will be used to help finance the cost of a feasibility study for the establishment of direct iron reduction plant here. This is the biggest grant ever made by the TDA on the African continent, and represents about 20 percent of the total cost of the feasibility study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This grant,&quot; says TDA Director, J. Joseph Grandmaison, &quot;represents another effort by President Clinton to further strengthen the economy of South Africa&quot; .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Moving this project forward,&quot; he added, &quot;represents a major step toward creating jobs and fostering economic development in the two countries, and it strengthens the trade relationship Between our two Nations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement was signed by the American Commercial Counsellor in South Africa, Millard Arnold, and IDC Managing Director, W.C. Van Der Merwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of the agreement, the IDC will set up a joint American-South African team of engineering consultants to undertake a technical, environmental and financial study of the reduction plant proposal. Should the project go ahead, it will cost an estimated 800 million US dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States Trade and Development Agency has been involved in a number of other projects in South Africa. It is also focusing on the development of transportation infrastructure projects in Africa to help sustain economic growth well into the next century.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - United States special envoy to Liberia, Howard Jeter, has praised Ghana's President Jerry John Rawlings for the job he was doing on the war-torn Liberia as chairman of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeter said here Sunday he had been to Liberia to interact with ECOMOG, the peace-keeping force launched by ECOWAS to see how the U.S. can help the force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He praised President Rawlings's untiring efforts atensuring peace in Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The U.S administration is happy at the superb job you are doing as chairman of ECOWAS, and hopes that, with you around, we will make progress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings told him that the change in the chairmanship of ECOWAS will not affect the organization's program for the peace process in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings, whose term as ECOWAS chairman ends this month, said whoever assumes the position will definitely seek an end to the carnage in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president said even though the optimism expressed about peace in Liberia has been elusive, &quot;there is a strong feeling now that we are on the threshold of peace than ever before.&quot; He said this is, however, based on the renewed commitment shown by the various factional leaders to bring matters to an end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is up to all of us to make sure that we nail this problem in the coffin and bring a new lease of life to our brothers and sisters in Liberia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president reiterated the need for the United States and the international community to make good their promises, adding: &quot;if all could cooperate in this effort at bringing peace to Liberia, it would bring about peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welcoming the American envoy earlier, Mohammed Ibn Chambas, Ghana's deputy minister of Foreign Affairs, expressed Accra's appreciation for the interest being shown by the United States for the Liberian crisis and its efforts aimed at bringing peace to the war-torn country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the fighting, which erupted last April in the Liberian capital of Monrovia, had set the peace process back. &quot;But through the efforts of President Rawlings, ECOMOG has reasserted itself, bringing about peace and creating safe havens where civilians go about their normal lives,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chambas emphasized the need to put back on track the Abuja Peace Accord, saying the forthcoming ECOWAS summit in Abuja offers the best opportunity to impress upon the various factions that the only option left is to restore peace.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) will feature prominently for the very first time when many of its members appear before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in two simultaneous sittings in KwaZulu-Natal region next week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The youths, all huddled in a hut at the home of local IFP leader, waiting for a bus that was to take them to a weekend conference in Ulundi, were unexpectedly cornered by unknown gunmen and massacred. Other cases due to be heard by the commission include those of murder, torture, massacres arson and kidnappings, allegedly perpetrated mainly by security forces and IFP members and officials.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Ministry of Health yesterday held a joint meeting with officials from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) to find out what could have led to the running out of polio vaccines at some posts during the first round of the National Immunization Days (NID).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NID co-ordinator, Mary Kaoma, confirmed in an interview yesterday that the two parties held a meeting at the NID secretariat &quot;to address discrepancies in the population figures of the polio immunization exercise&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The two teams agreed to firm up the target population of the under fives and margins there-in,&quot; Kaoma said, adding: &quot;Further efforts to improve co- ordination between the Ministry of Health and the seconded staff from the CSO were also agreed upon.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She explained that CSO has offered to further support the on-going NID exercise by beefing up its technical staff seconded to the NID's secretariat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaoma attributed the running out of vaccines to &quot;the overwhelming response&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We ran out of vaccines because some mothers brought some over fives as well and the volunteers felt they couldn't turn them away,&quot; Kaoma claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a source at the NID's secretariat disclosed in a separate interview yesterday that the vaccines ran out because &quot;the logistics were not put to the correct population of the under fives&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1.6 million target was far beow the actual number of under five children that needed immunization,&quot; the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The logistics were not put to the correct population of the under fives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Grace Kagodo, a consultant with the United Nations International Children's Fund (UNICEF), dismissed this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was mainly because of the over whelming response and some over fives turning up,&quot; Kagodo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, early reports coming into the NID's secretariat from the districts indicate that the exercise was successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Kaoma, in Northern Province, Kasama district reported approximately 74 per cent of children under five immunized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Southern Province, Livingstone and Kalomo South reported over 90 per cent coverage while Gwembe reported approximately 67 per cent,&quot; Kaoma said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the difficult North-Western Province, they are determined to catch all eligible children and immunization will continue until Tuesday in some districts,&quot; Kaoma disclosed. &quot;The full report will be released within the next two days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next round of NID's will occur on August 23 and 24.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Livingstone - Kalomo politicians from both the ruling Movement for Multi- Party Democracy and the three main opposition political parties have commended government for coming up with a simplified voters provisional register and portable voters cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking when they met for a briefing in the council secretary's office over the weekend, the opposing politicians said they were happy with the system government was usingfor the coming Presidential and Parliamentary election and had no complaints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalomo Council Secretary Bernard Siwakwi said the meeting was peaceful and would like the peaceful atmosphere exhibited during their meeting to be extended to the campaign field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Siwakwi said Kalomo and Southern Province in general was a peaceful area which knows no political hooliganism and politicians in the multi-party system should endevour to maintain calmness.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged for a clean power campaign during the forth coming elections and civil servants and public services workers would be at hand to give a helping hand for the opposing parties to ensure that Zambia enjoyed tranquility and harmony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile the National Party has called on the elections commission to strictly follow lied down electoral procedures if true democracy in the country is to be realised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Party secretary for elections Kalima Lwendo said today that the calling for by-elections for the vacant Mongu Central Constituency with only 90 days remaining before the general elections was unprocedural and a worst of country's scarce resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Lwendo said that the holding of such a by-election was totally unnecessary as it would not benefit anyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It also raises two technical issues...under what register are they going to conduct this by-elections. Is it the 1991 or 1996 register or both?&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are so many anomalies regarding the 1996 voters register with the position political parties saying that the whole exercise should be declared nil and void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Lwendo further wondered how the Elections Commission was very quick in declaring the Mongu Constituency vacant when they had failed to declare Mansa Central vacant following the imprisonment of area Member of Parliament Edward Chisha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He accused the Elections Commission of tribalism and nepotism, and said if the elections office could boast of autonomous, it should have made attempts to declare the constituency vacant instead of waiting for directives from the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also urged the commission to declare the Pambashe and Mandevu constituences vacant in order to adhere to the principles of democratic governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a lot of people in Lusaka found no one to attend to them at many registration centres where they had gone to chech for their names and voters cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This happened in response to the Elections Office advert urging people in six provinces excluding Lusaka, Copperbelt and Central province, to check their names with elections officers at stations where they had registered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some registered voters in Lusaka today turned up at the centres were they registered in a bid to collect their registration cards and check for their names in the provisional register despite the announcement by the electoral commission that the exercise has been deferred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the registered voters told ZANA that they were not aware that the exercise has been defrred due to non-arrival of registration cards from United States of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The voters blamed the elections office for the short notice of the postponement of the collection of voters cards after all the publicity that the cards were now ready.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Electoral Commission announced at the week that the it had decided to postpone the publication of of the provisional voters register in Lusaka, Central and Copperbelt provinces due to non-arrival of the cards from USA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public Liaison Officer Joel Sikazwe appealed to registered voters to be calm and wait for the arrival of their cards before they can check for their name in the provision registers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it would be unfair for the commission to allow the voters to check for their names only and go back later to collect their voters cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Zambezi the collection of voters cards and the checking of names from the voters registers from various polling stations on Zambezi west bank is going on at a very slow pace for lack of publicity in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A visit by ZIS at Mapachi primary school on Zambezi west, four kilometres from the boma, found only 10 people have collected their voters cards by this morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the villagers talked to said that they were not aware of the exercise of collecting the voters cards in which it have started today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the villagers Maybin Salipako said that he had no idea about the collection of voters cards since the information is only on the radio which does not own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salipako appealed to the government to publicise the information for many people to go to their various polling stations otherwise many of them will stay without.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the most affected villagers who are ignorant about the exercise are those leaving far in the bush at their fields cultivating their land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that if many people will not collect their voters cards then it will affect the fourth-coming elections and the attendance will be poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Zambezi district council secretary, Robinson Mwape, said it is still early but as time goes by, the news will spread and most of them will collect their cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mwape said that, all the voters registers and the cards have been succesfully distributed to all the polling stations in the district.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currency dealers attributed the latest plunge to the usual higher demand for hard currency in Kinsahsa during the vacation period.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Leaders of the 12-member Southern African Development Community (SADC) meet in Lesotho next month, for the regional grouping's annual summit where trade, investment, energy and food security will top the agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A SADC spokesman said in an interview Monday that the summit would, among other activities, review implementation of the SADC program of action, as well as discuss major economic and political developments in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Protocols likely to be considered by the summit include energy, anti-drug trafficking, transport and communications,&quot; the spokesman said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit, which starts Aug. 17, comes amid hopes that member states will agree on the finer details of a landmark treaty establishing a SADC trade facilitation protocol, and endorse measures to attract investment to the region, now one of the most attractive due to its relative political stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trade protocol, first proposed soon after SADC's establishment in 1992, was aimed at boosting intra-regional trade as part of a wider strategy to create a regional market with over 150 million people and a combined gross domestic product of over 15.7 billion US dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SADC ministers of trade and industry have already agreed that the protocol would eliminate tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, and establish mechanisms to ensure fair competition among investors in the region and encourage free movement of capital, goods and people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some member countries were said to be keen to sign the protocol and reign- in South Africa's perceived ambitions of swamping the region with its products. However, it was still unclear whether conditions imposed before the protocol could be signed had been fulfilled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among them was the recommendation at the SADC annual consultative meeting in South Africa in February this year that those countries affected by trade imbalances should first conclude bilateral trade agreements with members of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU), by March this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the members who have yet to sign trade agreements with SACU countries included Zimbabwe and Zambia. SACU, the only customs union in the region, comprises Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Swaziland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on the agenda for discussion by the council of ministers on August 21 and 22, would be the region's proposed Drought Relief Fund, estimated to have an initial capital of 30 million US dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SADC food security unit, based in Zimbabwe, was working out the legal modalities of the fund and expected these to be ready for discussion at the Maseru summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revolving fund would assist drought prone member countries in times of food shortages, and seed capital would come from donors, SADC governments and non-governmental organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A proposed protocol on the free movement of people is expected to generate heated debate, with South Africa likely to lead stiff opposition to plans to allow SADC nationals entry without restrictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa, SADC's largest economy, was arguing that the protocol would worsen the exodus of economic refugees trekking down south in search of jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also to be tabled for discussion were plans to censure SADC members in arrears, following a decision by the SADC council of ministers in February this year to impose stiff sanctions on culprits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the proposals, member countries in arrears to the regional body for more than three years could face expulsion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - HIV/AIDS infection cost an average 1.3 years of human development progress in some 56 countries around the world, surveyed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) between 1980 and 1992, according to the Human Development Report for 1996, released by the body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said that the impact was particularly severe on developing countries, which are said to account for 90 percent of the estimated 6,000 HIV infections which occur every day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research conducted for the UNDP at Columbia University and the Harvard Institute for International Development in the U.S., which has been included in the development report for the first time, shows that HIV/AIDS adversely affected the human development index (HDI). The index measures basic human capabilities, by ranking countries according to their average levels of life expectancy, educational attainment and basic purchasing power.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study compared the 1980 and 1992 HDI for the 56 countries with the estimated 1992 HDI that would have occurred if there were no Human Immuno Deficiency Virus (HIV) infection which causes the fatal Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). It concluded that an average 1.3 years of human development had been lost due to the disease in the countries involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, some African countries, including Zambia, had suffered more than 10 years loss of development. Tanzania was estimated to have suffered some eight years of developmental loss. Others were Rwanda (7 years) and the Central African Republic, thought to have incurred similar loss. Burundi, Kenya, Malawi, Uganda and Zimbabwe were estimated to have lost between three and five years in human development progress, according to the findings quoted in the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNDP said it had become increasingly clear that countries in the world could not sustain high levels of economic growth without a strong foundation of human development. Some 89 countries had been hit by economic stagnation over the past 10 years, thereby reducing the incomes of more than a quarter of the world's population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report said that of the 46 countries that showed some economic progress during the period, 19 or more than 40 percent had suffered contracting employment opportunities or jobless growth.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOC secretary-general, Elias Gora, said Wednesday that the committee asked for an &quot;unreserved apology for this discrepancy&quot; in a letter sent to ACOG.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gora said, in a telephone interview from Atlanta, that the letter was addressed to ACOG president and chief executive officer, William Payne, and copied to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Association of African NOCs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the letter, the Nigerian Committee reminded ACOG that the black-out, by NBC television, which took a commerical break when the Nigerian contingent marched in, was a recurrence of the situation at the Los Angeles games in 1984.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We feel such repeated action on Nigeria is rather deliberate,&quot; the letter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are very concerned about the future of the games if such ugly events are embarked on,&quot; it said, adding: &quot;Our contingent is in Atlanta for the Olympics and not politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Nigeria's acting consul-general in New York, Charles Awani, has condemned NBC's action, saying it was &quot;deliberate rather than coincidental&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe it is not in the spirit of the Olympics for them to select a few African countries for this type of treatment,&quot; Awani said. &quot;It is not right especially against the backdrop of our relationship with the government of the U.S.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian and United States governments have been at loggerheads as Washington has accused Abuja of human rights abuses.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The Gays and Lesbians Association of Zimbabwe (GALZ) has been banned from exhibiting in this year's Zimbabwe International Book Fair and from all future book fairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Issuing the order, the government of Zimbabwe said homosexuality is immoral and against the country's cultural ethics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Director of Information, Bornwell Chakaodza, said Tuesday that by barring GALZ from exhibiting at the Zimbabwe International Book Fair (ZIBF), the government was not contravening any of its laws but protecting the nation's cultural values.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In light of the foregoing, the position of the government of Zimbabwe has not changed. The Gays and Lesbians Association of Zimbabwe remain barred from renting a stand at this year's book fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And they remain banned from displaying their books and other reading materials at future international book fairs of Zimbabwe,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the second time that the government has banned GALZ from exhibiting at book fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year's ban provoked harsh criticism at home and abroad, including demonstrations against President Robert Mugabe when he visited South Africa, New Zealand and the Netherlands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite last year's ban and Mugabe's condemnation of homosexuality, the organisers of the book had decided to allow GALZ to exhibit at this year's week-long fair starting July 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the opening ceremony of last year's book fair, Mugabe described homosexuals as perverts and sodomists. He branded homosexuals as worse than dogs and pigs, adding they were not entitled to rights of any kind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Executive Director of the fair, Trish Mbanga, said &quot;we want to exercise democracy. We cannot stop them from participating but people can just ignore them if they want to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace and the Zimbabwe Catholic Bishops Conference said there was nothing wrong with GALZ exhibiting literature, mostly on AIDS, which would benefit its members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a newly-formed Christian Communicators Association of Zimbabwe had threatened to mobilise Christians to boycott the book fair, and Sangano Munhumutapa, a pressure group, had threatened violence and &quot;total sabotage&quot;, if gays were allowed to exhibit .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chakaodza said &quot;The barring of GALZ from renting a stand at the fair is not a question of contravening the laws of Zimbabwe or the country's own declaration of rights. Neither is it a question of violating freedom of art and expression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a question of protecting and guaranteeing the cultural health of zimbabwe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said GALZ had no right to publicly display literature and material at a public and cultural event where hundreds of children visited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He denied recent press reports that information, posts and telecommunications minister, Joyce Mujuru, had said the government would not interfere with organisers of the book fair in their decision to allow GALZ to exhibit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No reason was given for the last-minute cancellation of the meeting between NADECO and the National Reconciliation Committee (NARECOM).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting was to have taken place in Owo (western Nigeria), home of the of NADECO chief Michael Ajasin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is regrettable that the military leadership has missed yet another opportunity to explore ways and means of resolving our lingering crisis through dialogue,&quot; Ajasin said in a reaction to the flopped meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;Nigeria, which belongs to all of us, is not at war. The lesson of history teaches us that a national political crisis is only resolvable through dialogue.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government is implementing a transition to democracy program expected to end in October 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Akinyele announced last week that the now aborted meeting with NADECO was to have served as part of government's reconciliation efforts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - The Council of Ministers of the 16-nation Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) currently meeting in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, is expected to devote Wednesday's session to the Liberian peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An ECOWAS official told PANA the ministerial session, ahead of the July 26- 27 ECOWAS summit, is expected to be attended by the chairman of the Liberian Council of State, Wilson Sankowolo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ECOWAS, which deployed the peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG to Liberia in August 1990, has been involved in protracted efforts to end the six-year factional war in Africa's first republic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a draft agenda for the meeting, the ministerial council is expected to consider a draft status of the agreement between ECOWAS and the Liberian government with the purpose of defining the privileges and immunities to be accorded the peace force. In addition, the council will recommend a framework underlining the international composition of ECOMOG and granting the force adequate protection and freedom for the execution of its mandate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following lack of progress in the Liberian peace process, ECOWAS officials have suggested that ECOMOG, currently estimated at 10,500 troops, be strengthened to enforce peace in the war-ravaged country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his report to the ongoing meetings in Abuja, the ECOWAS Executive Secretary, Edouard Benjamin, noted international frustration with the attitudes of the liberian warlords on the implementation of the peace plan and called for severe sanctions on erring faction leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin also expressed concern that pledges of financial support to ECOMOG had not been redeemed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some ECOWAS countries who pledged to contribute more troops to the peacekeeping force were yet to fulfil this commitment, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian war started as a rebellion against the government of President Samuel Doe by the Charles Taylor-led National Patriotic Front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite Doe's assassination by Taylor's rival, Prince Yormie Johnson, in September 1990, the war has continued, after killing more than 150,000 people and rendering almost half of Liberia's estimated 2.5 million population refugees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to send in the mission was taken late Monday by an urgent ambassadorial meeting of the central organ of the OAU mechanism for conflict prevention, management and resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mission will comprise the representatives of Cameroon's president, Paul Biya, the current OAU chairman, Ethiopia, and Zimbabwe, as well as the OAU Secretary General. Ethiopia was the past OAU chairman while Zimbabwe takes over in 1997.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The central organ strongly condemned the weekend massacre at a camp in Bungendana, where it said &quot;hundreds of people were killed while others were injured, as well as other killings that have been taking place in other parts of the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OAU body also extended the mandate of the OAU observer mission in Burundi (Omib), which expired July 22, for a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said it would review the situation in the trouble-torn central African state &quot;on the basis of the progress made on the implementation of the Arusha initiative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a sub-regional meeting held in Arusha, northern Tanzania June 25, it was decided that an African force be sent into the country to stop the current violence from degenerating into genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The central OAU organ on conflicts urged all concerned parties in Burundi to put an immediate end &quot;to indiscriminate killings and senseless acts of violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It urged Burundians to seek a peaceful solution to the problem in their country through dialogue, and by making use of the good offices of former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere, within the framework provided by the recent Arusha regional summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The central organ reiterated the OAU's full support for the efforts made by Nyerere and the for the decisions taken at Arusha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It called for the speedy implementation of these decisions, which were endorsed earlier this month by the OAU summit held in Yaounde, Cameroon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African countries and the international community at large were also urged to lend political and material support to regional peace efforts, &quot;so that concerted and determined action can be marshalled to a lasting and peaceful solution to the political and security crisis in Burundi.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Speculation is being heard in political circles that Nelson Mandela may be retiring from the presidency sooner than generally anticipated.  The president has repeatedly stated his intention of limiting himself to a single term of office, which expires in 1999. But will he wait for 1999? Or will he make way for his successor at an earlier stage in order to smooth the transition?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with the rest of South Africa, we would be terribly saddened to see Mandela step down from the presidency. But if he must go, there is some sense in confronting the moment sooner, rather than later. It would send a signal of confidence in his successor to the country, and to the international community, while his continued presence &quot;in the wings&quot;, so to say, would be reassuring. It would also reduce the risk of (heaven forbid!) the president being incapacitated, or even dying in office, which -- as various scares over his health have already demonstrated -- would inevitably create a sense of crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also a certain logic about a hand-over at this stage. Mandela has largely succeeded in his main task of national reconciliation; he can now argue it is time for a younger generation to proceed with the job of reconstruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The successor to Mandela is already obvious and there are grounds for hope that Thabo Mbeki -- who has already shouldered many of the responsibilities for reconstruction -- will prove a worthy heir. Nevertheless, as Mandela has already made clear, the succession is not in his gift and will have to be decided by a democratic vote of the African National Congress. Presumably the course of action would be for Mandela to stand down as leader of the ANC while remaining head of state. A party election would be held to choose a new leader who would be the de facto president-elect. Mandela would then be able to retire on his own timing -- presumably allowing some months to pass during which the country would hopefully be able to come to terms with the idea of his departure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC will be staging its next two-yearly congress in Cape Town in September. If Mandela chooses that opportunity to set the mechanism of his retirement in motion he will have more than two years to play with. It will be intriguing to see if he so decides.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dar es Salaam - The former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere has said that East African troops will, if necessary, invade Burundi in an attempt to pacify the escalating civil war and halt ethnic massacres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyerere, the elder statesman mediator between the Tutsi-controlled government and Hutu rebels, said Burundi's leaders will not be allowed to back out of their agreement to intervention made at a regional summit in Arusha, Tanzania, last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he advised Burundi's overwhelmingly Tutsi army, which is divided over the issue with some elements threatening to fight foreign troops, that to secure its future it must co-operate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can't allow another Rwanda. We will have to go in whether Burundi wants it or not. The army may say no, so they can do what? Fight and win? I think the leadership knows it cannot win,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the summit Burundi's prime minister Antoine Nduwayo, a Tutsi, and its largely powerless president Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, a Hutu, were pressured into &quot;requesting security assistance&quot; from neighbouring states concerned that the conflict -- which has claimed about 150 000 mostly civilian lives in under three years -- will spill over Burundi's borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But within hours of returning home Nduwayo was accused of high treason by his own party. Under a barrage of threats from extremists, most notably from within parts of the army which fear that intervention will break the Tutsi minority's dominance of the military, the prime minister retreated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He rejected the idea of intervention by foreign troops and tried to shift responsibility for the Arusha agreement to the president. But Nyerere said leaders at the summit had been specific in pinning both men down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know Burundi. We know that in the past the president and prime minister have not spoken with one voice and we wanted to make sure this request was made with the agreement of both of them. The president cannot be accused of exceeding his mandate,&quot; said Nyerere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Organisation of African Unity endorsed the plan at its annual summit in Cameroon two weeks ago, the forced intervention raises the possibility of East African soldiers being shot at by both Burundi's army and rebels. Nyerere said that leaders in the region have told him they remain united in their determination to ensure that troops go in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mandate of an intervention force is still to be finalised. Even those elements of Burundi's army willing to countenance foreign troops argue that they should be confined to border areas to combat rebel incursions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyerere said that would defeat the purpose. &quot;That force has a clear mandate to provide protection for everybody, and everybody is not on the border. It was specific that they will shoot at anybody who disturbs the peace, including the army. Burundi has to be serious about this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crucial to a settlement, he said, is allaying the army's fears that it will be dismantled. &quot;No external forces will go in to destroy the army unless it decides to fight. The politics of Burundi being what they are, a political solution needs the existence of that army.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While foreign troops may provide a breathing space for negotiations, Nyerere sees little progress towards a final settlement. &quot;I'd be lying to myself if I said these talks have shown movement. The ethnic cleansing suits the politics. You have this lack of leadership there now. This is the problem of Burundi.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Since Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe announced on television earlier this year that he will soon retire, identifying a successor has become a major topic of debate in Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is a succession vacuum which political observers blame on Mugabe's leadership style. Mugabe, a Marxist-Leninist, had ambitions to establish a one-party state in the 1980s, and heavily aligned himself with North Korea, former communist Eastern Europe, China and Cuba, all places where the idea of the &quot;dear leader&quot; was cherished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1987, Zimbabwe's constitution was amended to create structures to entrench the effective one- party state, including the executive presidency, which gave Mugabe extraordinary power.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the 1987 unity accord between Mugabe's Zanu-PF party and Joshua Nkomo's now-defunct Zapu that brought an end to the civil war which, from 1981 to 1987 left more than 5 000 dead and devastated the Matebeleland province, Mugabe has become extremely powerful through Zanu-PF's Soviet- styled Politburo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Politburo is mainly composed of Cabinet ministers and effectively rules the country. Its members are appointed solely by Mugabe at his discretion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Welshman Ncube, a constitutional lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe and a political analyst, says there is a succession vacuum in Zanu- PF and the country, because &quot;the two vice- presidents, Simon Muzenda and Joshua Nkomo, are too old and ignorant -- they cannot be an alternative to Mugabe. They are not qualified for the job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ncube says the Politburo has been used by Mugabe to marginalise &quot; intelligent ministers, because to be near to Mugabe you have to be a puppet.  If the ruling party had a policy of giving people positions on the basis of merit alone, then you would obviously have competent people around Mugabe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it is, he says, &quot;Mugabe has perfected (the) politics of patronage.&quot; Succession debates have been ruthlessly quashed within the party in its congresses, most notably earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe himself says the time will come when he will retire, &quot;and perhaps it is not far off and then young ones will take our place&quot;. But unlike South African President Nelson Mandela who is punting Thabo Mbeki to replace him, Mugabe does not want to groom a future president. His attitude is that the debate on succession should surface when he has left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe says a leader &quot;must be chosen by the people, not groomed. I can groom ministers, but I cannot groom a president. People must groom their president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many observers think Mugabe has destroyed all potential leaders. Dr John Makumbe, a University of Zimbabwe political scientist, says potential presidents have been reduced to tribal provincial leaders and no individual, other than Mugabe himself, cultivates a national image.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The result is that Zanu-PF is now a conglomerate of provincial factions ...  The old guard want Mugabe to go on because they fear that if he goes, the various tribal factions will be at war,&quot; says Makumbe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite Mugabe's efforts to marginalise opponents within and outside the party, a few remain visible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most notable is Dr Eddison Zvobgo, Zanu-PF's legal secretary and a shrewd politician. He has, since the 1980s, been identified as having presidential ambitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zvobgo, leader of the majority Karanga tribe of the Masvingo Province in the south, has tried to lead the succession debate. Giving his &quot;personal views&quot; to parliamentarians at a function earlier this year, Zvobgo said the debate should &quot;be placed on the national agenda for the 21st century&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zvobgo said the executive presidency has dictatorial powers and that future presidents should be limited to two terms only. Mugabe's term is unlimited.  Zvobgo also wants the electoral bodies to be independent, and not to be appointed by the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, Zvobgo was the architect of the present amended constitution when he was the minister of justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another presidential hopeful is Minister of Home Affairs Dumiso Dabengwa, who is tipped to succeed Nkomo as leader of the Ndebele. Nkomo has expressed a desire to retire following a recent operation in a Cape Town clinic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dabengwa, a former Zapu intelligence supremo, is another well-known politician who could eventually -- and ironically -- fill Mugabe's shoes. In 1982, after being acquitted by Zimbabwe's courts of treason, Mugabe sent Dabenwga back to jail, only releasing him in 1986.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dabengwa has since risen steadily to become a Cabinet and Politburo member.  He has leadership qualities and is well respected. He is also a former ruling- party chairman in Matebeleland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of Lands and Water Development Kumbirai Kangai is yet another contender. He is the current party chief in the eastern Manicaland province, which is dominated by the Manyika tribe. Although the party, like in Masvingo, is facing bitter internal feuding, Kangai has survived since the liberation war in the 1970s. He was a member of the High Command (Dare Rechimurenga) of Zanu-PF's liberation movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emmersor Mnangwagwa, the current minister of justice, is another contender.  He is the party supremo of the Midlands province, but his record is tarnished by his years as minister of national security during the Matebeleland skirmishes. The Central Intelligence Organisation committed many atrocities during his tenure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incumbent Minister of National Security Dr Sydney Sekeramayi, an ex- guerrilla who has been credited with reforming the CIO, is another dark horse who could win the top post.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Nelson Mandela didn't want a state banquet, so he was given a concert instead: in the red and gold of the Albert Hall, on a night when the sun set huge and orange behind the building. Three hours before the music would start, the players began ambling in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phil Collins, at the back for this gig, playing the drums. In the loose denim-striped shirt with the yellow and black baseball cap tight on his head, Hugh Masekela, whose jazz would, later on, silence the audience, then have them swaying as one. And the mover among this crowd -- Quincy Jones, conducting tonight, wearing pleated black Issey Miyake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The big one, the really huge white guy with such pale skin and that moon- shaped face under the black glasses, he was the gate-crasher who came in with Jones. Marlon Brando. Or Leroy, as Jones and Masekela call him.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leroy, why Leroy? Two hours before the concert, and the men, all hot off planes, are sitting down to platefuls of corn on the cob, fried chicken and watermelon. &quot;He just called me this morning,&quot; said Jones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pretended to be one of those guys from Paris Match, then I caught his voice, and I said, Leroy, that's Leroy. He just wanted to come and hang out, he's a Mandela man.&quot; And Jones remembers he hasn't got Brando a pass yet -- Brando's in the building, though not a lot of people have realised, but with the heavy-duty security here tonight, he needs a pass like everybody else.  Jones calls someone over. &quot;I got passes for eveyone except my daughter. I still need one for her. And Marlon Brando.&quot; The man thinks it's a joke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, but why Leroy? &quot;Oh, Leroy's a nickname, old New York story, you don't want to go into that.&quot; Masekela's hooting with joy now, still managing his corn fine, though. &quot;He, he,&quot; Masekela chortles in his smoke-charred voice, &quot; you can't tell that Leroy story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Marlon went to this club when I first met him,&quot; Jones starts, settling back and licking his fingers. &quot;In Harlem. He was the only white dude there, and he sat off by himself, and he saw five girls sitting over by a table with a dude. So one of the girls looked at him and said, 'Let's go dance' -- Marlon was a great dancer then, this was 1951 -- so he goes out on the dance floor, and he's tearing it up, and he takes the girl back to the table and the dude's there with a toothpick in his mouth and his hat lowered, and he doesn't look too happy about this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So Marlon goes and sits down and sees the dude giving him cold stares, you know, and he's the only white dude in there. So he goes back over there, and he goes, 'Look man, I just danced with the girl, no problems, I brought her back to the table, and we were just having a little fun.' The guy didn't even look up. He had his hat on and the toothpick, and he said, 'The name ain't man, the name is Leroy. L.E.R.O.Y.'&quot; It may be 45 years old, that story, but it still has them near off their chairs cracking up at the telling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It only takes five minutes with these men -- and five minutes is about as long as I get to see Brando before he disappears -- to know that this is it.  Real comradeship: men, tough men, who can call each other when things go wrong, with the women maybe, or the fame or the children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sidney Poiter introduced Brando to Jones a long time ago at the Birdland Club in New York. So maybe it's the longevity, the stuff they've seen, the places they came from. Maybe it's the music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quincy Delight Jones makes the music happen. Owner of 26 Grammy awards, it's Jones who produced Michael Jackson's Thriller, the biggest-selling album of all time (&quot;I haven't heard from Michael much lately,&quot; says Jones. &quot;He's been busy, and I certainly have&quot;) and Jones who wrote We are the World -- a sentiment which sold the biggest-selling single ever. When Buzz Aldrin stepped off the spaceship, he took the cassette of Fly me to the Moon that Jones arranged and conducted for Count Basie and Frank Sinatra, and that's the first earth music ever to vibrate on that moon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tonight the music is big band. &quot;Everybody's getting back to their roots, I tell you&quot; says Jones, &quot;I haven't had this much fun, man, since I worked with Sinatra and Basie, man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whoa,&quot; go Masekela and Jones together, and laugh again. &quot;This is why we got in the business, man,&quot; says Jones. Really? I ask. Really as good as with Sinatra and Basie, because it never is, is it? &quot;Oh yeah,&quot; says Jones. &quot;With Tony Bennett, you kidding? Every time we were getting ready to make a record, Frank would say, well listen, let's see what Tony's been recording -- maybe we'll use one of those.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People say Jones's address book is the best there is. &quot;If you've been around long enough, you get to meet folk on the way,&quot; he says. He's had five relationships with women over that time, starting with Jeri when they were both 20, high-school sweethearts, and finishing, most recently, with Nastassia Kinski, from whom he split last year, and with whom he had a child.  But that's about all he's saying on this subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Honey, I don't want to get into all that,&quot; he says, and it's serious. &quot;I got seven kids with seven women over 43 years -- that's it.&quot; Seven women? &quot;No, seven children between, uh, five women, over 43 years. That's it.&quot; &quot;Well, who're you sleeping with these days?&quot; Masekela says to me reprovingly, his open, merry face looking displeased. When I tell them, though, they're choking on that corn again, wondering which planet I stepped off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jones has six daughters and one son. The son was born in London. &quot;The morning we went in to have him, Lennon went in with a sleeping bag because Yoko was there. She lost the baby, but my son was born on the same day in 1968. He was premature though, 14 weeks, we didn't know if he was going to live or not. He made it though -- he's a big sucker now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past, Jones's children have said he was a neglectful father. &quot;It wasn't so bad,&quot; he says. &quot;I understand much more now about nurturing children, but I always loved my children. They know when you don't know what you're doing; they forgive that. The way I was raised, if you were able to eat every day, and had clothes on, and a roof over your head, you were being a good father. We didn't understand words like nourishing and cholesterol and all that kind of stuff then. I don't think they knew about it in the Thirties and Forties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jones has come a long way from his childhood, South Side Chicago apartment slum, and a mother who was taken away from him and put in an asylum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's paid his dues. In 1974 he suffered two brain aneurisms and came close to death. In the Eighties he had a nervous breakdown. Working too hard, people said. He doesn't suffer any depression or anxiety attacks now though, he says. &quot;After two brain operations and a nervous breakdown, you have given it the office. It's enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so being rich and famous, is it good? Is it over-rated? Does he like spending money on things? &quot;You know, I don't think of it like that, I think of it as protecting you, so you aren't vulnerable to external stuff -- that's what I like about it a lot. I got my first message about that from Picasso (he worked in France in the Fifties, across the street from Picasso).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I saw his independence, and his ability to create into old age, do whatever he wanted to do. And I loved that. That hasn't been normal circumstances for Afro-Americans, you know, so I like the idea of that very much. He had 12 litho plants, and nobody forcing him to go in any direction except the way he wanted -- he was independent. Only way to be. Somebody else is going to own it if you don't, right?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The only good of being famous is if you can help somebody,&quot; he says. &quot; People were there for me, you know. Ray Charles. We used to have dreams. And we lived out a lot of the dreams.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even tonight, as the crowds are beginning to throng outside the round concert hall, the mounted police moving into position, there are still bad things going on out there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think racism is at its worst ever,&quot; says Quincy Jones -- and he's seen plenty. &quot;Marlon said this to me, he said: 'After all the shit we went through in the Fifties and Sixties, I can't believe it's as bad as it is.' Especially young people, I can't understand that -- young people have no reason at all to be into racism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maybe it's the music, I think later on, after hearing Masekela play. Maybe the kids just can't hear the music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I think racism is at its worst ever. I can't understand -- young people have no reason at all to be into racism'.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Amnesty International is battling to get a foothold in the new South Africa. It does not have enough members locally to finance an office or staff, or enough political support to make an impact on government policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is despite the fact that the organisation supported the African National Congress tirelessly during the struggle against apartheid.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty volunteer Noel van Breda said this week the introduction of a human rights culture in South Africa had not led to increased political and civic support for Amnesty locally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation had been battling to win the ear of a number of senior ANC leaders in government and its representatives had been &quot;cold-shouldered&quot; by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki during a visit to South Africa last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The representatives were stunned at Mbeki's attitude, particularly when they tried to discuss South Africa's relations with Nigeria. The reception that Amnesty International got was very cool and we did not go down well in Mbeki's office. We were accused of meddling in South Africa's affairs,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Breda said the organisation would be monitoring South Africa's foreign policy closely, particularly in the context of the Southern African region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He expressed hope that Amnesty International South Africa's second annual general meeting, taking place this week in Cape Town, will attract a tide of new members so that it can establish itself locally. Van Breda currently has to send faxes from a public facility in Cape Town and uses his personal cellphone to take Amnesty calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the skills the organisation will be teaching new members at the conference is how to lobby ANC MPs, and to re-establish the relations that have lapsed since the liberation movement moved into government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegates will be coming from numerous countries, including Slovenia, Sweden, Ghana and the United Kingdom.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Transnet has one of South Africa's most aggressive affirmative action programmes, and deputy managing director Saki Macozoma concedes it is not only hitting the company's &quot;Broederbond&quot; contingent but is affecting morale and performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shake-up at the R16-billion state-owned transport giant, which used to be a bastion of white job reservation, is being spearheaded by Macozoma, a former ANC MP, and five other black executive directors who were all appointed in April this year. Along with chair Louise Tager, they run the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as Macozoma and some of his colleagues have relatively little business experience, the move has sparked criticism in business circles. Some claim that the government has gone too far, too fast in its drive to make Transnet an affirmative action role model.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Macozoma's only business experience is a stretch as business development manager at South African Breweries before taking up his post as chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Posts, Telecommunications and Broadcasting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he argues that his lack of experience in business does not mean he is unequal to the job. He believes that because his main task is to transform Transnet and rid it of its staid, &quot;Broederbond&quot; culture, his lack of a business grounding is not that crucial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are few managers here in touch with the reality of the transformation that has to take place. People in Transnet make the mistake that they call someone they have never seen inexperienced just because they have been cocooned in an Afrikaans white world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I don't want to underrate their experience ... My view is that I accept my shortcomings and I will find out about, or delegate what I don't know. Management is not about knowing everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Macozoma -- who spent five years on Robben Island -- arrived at Transnet, the plan was that MD Anton Moolman would mentor him in the run-up to his retirement. However, Moolman last week announced he will quit early and step down at the end of August. Macozoma, who will take over as MD, dismisses any suggestion of a coup, saying the perception that he and Moolman have had an antagonistic relationship has been overblown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says the new team effectively robbed Moolman of his authority, ruling out a clash. &quot;It is precisely because he had no authority that there was no clash. There was no role for him. It was his personal decision to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Macozoma says Moolman wanted him and the six others to go on training courses to Harvard and Stanford in the United States. But this was out of the question as the new team had to get on with the job of transforming Transnet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is not much he can mentor me about,&quot; Macozoma adds. &quot;He is not about transformation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Macozoma is not impressed with what he has inherited at Transnet. He complains of widespread inefficiency and numerous cosy deals between Transnet officials and friends and relatives. The company is currently investigating the appointment of a consultancy firm that employed Moolman's son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Macozoma homes in on the practice of hiring outside consultants at the drop of a hat -- a habit which landed the government with a R500-million bill last year. This, he says, has to stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parastatal, which owns Spoornet and South African Airways, has had its staff decimated from 282 000 to 115 000 in the past 15 years, in the process of being &quot;commercialised&quot; from a lumbering state monolith. Last year it recorded its first profit since becoming &quot;commercialised&quot;. Macozoma says this year will not be as good, because of a slow-down in economic activity and because of a slump in morale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Macozoma's list of goals as future MD includes further cuts, the possibility of some sell-offs and management of the parastatal's huge pension fund deficit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He knows Transnet's affirmative action crusade has to work -- &quot;we are aware of its demonstration value&quot; -- but he is also mindful of the lack of skilled blacks he can hire and the compromises that have to be made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme has in some instances led to the unusual situation of people being appointed to high posts and then sent on management training courses. &quot; I can live with this compromise. We need programmes which give people the skills in the shortest possible time, and during that period we need to give them responsibilities equal to or even greater than their skills. There is a delicate balance between making them tokens and overwhelming them with responsibilities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He notes that many highly trained black employees have in the past quit Transnet because they found the culture unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transnet's transformation strategy includes giving at least half the value of its contracts with other companies to black enterprises wherever possible.  Naturally, says Macozoma, this means at first mainly &quot;soft areas&quot; like catering, law and accountancy. &quot;The companies simply aren't there in fields like engineering.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes one of the keys to a successful affirmative action programme is giving employees a goal to work towards. In the past, he says, black trainees remained trainees forever because their trainers refused to help people they saw as competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The morale problem among the white employees is not omnipresent, and he believes there are many whites who welcome the changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Symptoms of turmoil within the parastatal have leaked out during the past few months, first with allegations by the South African Harbour and Railway Workers' Union (Sahrwu) that SAA was bugging its phones. Then there was news that some senior officials, including one of the new executive directors, had been misusing their credit cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transnet this week announced it had tightened its controls on company cards.  The parastatal's predominantly white union, the Transport Workers' Union, is understood to have been pushing for action to be taken on this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Macozoma says the company is investigating the bugging claims. Although it is too early to say if there is truth in the allegations, he says the accusation is symptomatic of uneasy relations between management and the unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he was headhunted for the job, his first reaction was: &quot;What do I know about transport?&quot; But after discussions with President Nelson Mandela and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki about whether to take the plunge into the corporate world or remain in politics, he decided it was the right move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He accepts that at 39 he has put his future &quot;on the block&quot; by taking such a challenging job. But that, he says, is exactly what he has been doing since he joined the ANC at the age of 16.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs this week gave mixed signals whether South Africa would consider contributing troops to a multi-national peace force for Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad appeared to contradict President Nelson Mandela this week when he told the Mail &amp; Guardian South Africa would study requests for troops in multi-national peace operations &quot;on a case-by-case basis&quot;, but that &quot;we have not ruled out troops in this case&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The worsening civil war in the tiny Central African country has highlighted South Africa's dilemma -- and apparent differences in government thinking -- over what role to play in peace operations on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humanitarian organisations have warned for months that Burundi is inching towards the fate of neighbouring Rwanda, where at least 500 000 people, mostly Tutsis, were slaughtered in 1993 by Hutu extremists. Both countries have the same ethnic make-up: about 85% Hutu and 14% Tutsi. Over 100 000 Burundians, mostly civilian, have died in three years of instability.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three months ago the United Nations (UN), much lambasted for its non- response to the Rwanda genocide, started mooting military intervention in Burundi, followed by similar discussions in the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela quashed hopes of active involvement in such a force on the eve of his visit to Britain, when he told foreign correspondents: &quot;We have been approached by the UN but we have to be very cautious about our background where our army destabilised the neighbouring countries ... We are prepared to supply humanitarian assistance ... but the military, I will resist that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Pahad told the Mail &amp; Guardian: &quot;Personally I don't think we should harp too much on our past. I don't think we must ignore it, but it must not be a key factor in determining when we get involved, especially in relation to sending troops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said South Africa was one of 21 countries invited by the UN about three months ago to discuss multi- national intervention in Burundi under the UN Mandate Chapter VII, which authorises peace enforcement to prevent genocide.  Peace enforcement, unlike peacekeeping, does not require the consent of warring parties and increases the danger of exposure to enemy fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pahad said South Africa disagreed with the UN proposal, feeling any peace operation needed the support of Burundians, &quot;otherwise we have a situation like Somalia (where the United States peace enforcement operation of 1992/1993 collapsed after casualties among soldiers)&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he said &quot;in principle South Africa cannot reject involvement&quot; in Burundi because of its obligations to the UN, the OAU and SADC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, he told SAfm radio: &quot;We don't think it is right yet in terms of (the SANDF's) experience to send troops... At the moment we are not looking at troops.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pressed for an explanation on the apparent difference to what he had earlier told the Mail &amp; Guardian, he would only say: &quot;In principle we have not ruled out the participation of South African National Defence Force (SANDF) troops in peacekeeping operations. This will be determined on a case- by-case basis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pahad's apparent contradiction of Mandela mirrors divergent statements last year when Mandela called for oil sanctions against Nigeria from the Commonwealth heads-of-state summit in New Zealand. Pahad, addressing an almost simultaneous media briefing in Pretoria, said he could envisage no more than minor sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, calls for decisive action in Burundi intensified this week.  Kathi Austin, policy adviser of EarthAction, an international network of more than 1,500 peace, justice and environmental organisations, argued that &quot;only robust international intervention can save Burundians from a further bloodbath&quot; -- and that the UN had no choice under Chapter VII but to intervene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An East African summit under the auspices of the OAU, led by Tanzanian elder statesman Julius Nyerere, last month elicited a request from Burundi's Hutu President Sylvestre Ntibantuganya and Tutsi Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo for an African peacekeeping force. But a technical team to work out the details was refused entry, and now elements of the Tutsi-controlled army - - responsible for much of the violence -- has backtracked on the request. Now Nyerere has threatened an &quot;invasion&quot; of Burundi by East African troops (see story on page 17).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the OAU summit in Cameroon earlier this month, and an SADC summit in Gaborone a fortnight ago, backed the call for a peace operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the US and the UN have made it clear they want South Africa to contribute to peace operations on the continent, South Africa has steered clear of the potentially awkward decision. Factors counting against it include concerns over South African dominance of the region and questions whether the SANDF integration process has progressed far enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greg Mills, the national director of the South African Institute of International Affairs, pointed out that almost two-thirds of respondents in a poll last year favoured peace operations, but cautioned that South Africa will expose itself to a situation &quot;like the US in Somalia&quot; -- especially acute if there is no clear distinction between &quot;the good guys and the bad guys&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Like prospectors heading out into the wild west in search of wealth beyond their wildest dreams, Andrew Sweetnam and Fanie Pelser left South Africa in February to investigate mining opportunities in Angola. They have not been seen again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, Namibian advocate Jan Malan left on a similar expedition and disappeared just as mysteriously. Malan was carrying close to R1-million and Pelser had more than R300 000.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All three men relied on unofficial go-betweens to escort them to Angola.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and other mining concession owners said their disappearance should serve as a warning to other South Africans embarking on unofficial expeditions in the hope of getting rich quick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sweetnam's family has not given up hope that he is still alive. &quot;Andrew's just got to be alive. In 1991 we lost his oldest brother. I don't want to go through that again,&quot; said his mother Mrs Mickey Sweetnam, in an interview punctuated by tears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sweetnam said her son was a diamond sorter employed by Pelser who said he was going to buy a diamond concession. They left for Caprivi in Namibia on February 14 to meet two men who were to take them across the border to Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After five days, when they did not come out, we started panicking. We heard all kinds of stories, they had been ambushed and kidnapped by rebels who were holding them for ransom,&quot; said Sweetnam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then we heard the people Andrew was involved with had connections with Executive Outcomes (a former mercenary group which was active in Angola). If there was a link, I'm 100% sure it was without Andrew's knowledge. As there's a God above my head I swear my son is no mercenary. He did his military service in the navy and has had no training since then.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sweetnam said when the four South African men who were held hostage in Angola by Unita flew home two weeks ago, she &quot;cried her heart out&quot; when she heard how they were ill-treated. She immediately contacted their relatives to ask if any of them had seen her son, but discovered that they had been held in isolation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Andrew has a wife and two small children who need their father. We are all praying that he is alive and will return to us soon,&quot; said Sweetnam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pelser's brother Bill is not as confident the two are still alive. He had worked in Angola and said the diamond-rich areas in the north were like the &quot; wild west&quot; where banditry was the order of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the moment Fanie is just missing. But my gut feeling is that he has been executed and the money was taken,&quot; Pelser said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although his brother had been involved in Executive Outcomes, he had resigned from the outfit and had gone to Angola representing an international banking group. Pelser refused to name the group, or confirm whether it involved people linked to Executive Outcomes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He had a letter of intent from them, indicating that they were interested in setting up businesses in Angola with interests in mining, schools and hospitals,&quot; Pelser said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were supposed to meet Unita in the north, because Unita controls most of the diamond areas. Unita people also have the portfolios of Ministry of Energy and Ministry of Mines and Minerals, so it makes sense to work with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I have spoken to Unita and they say my brother did not arrive for his appointment with them. They suggested that Fanie and Andrew were in an isolated area and couldn't send word to us. I have no reason to suspect them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pelser said he believed the two men who were to take his brother and Sweetnam to Angola were the most likely suspects. He said one had returned to South Africa and refused to speak to him, and the other was now based in England.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have approached various people for help, but it's like talking to a wall. The South African Police Services can do nothing because no crime has been committed in South Africa. We've tried the intelligence community, the Red Cross, the Angolan ambassador and Interpol. Interpol says they are investigating, but they've turned up nothing yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am so heartsore for Fanie's family. He is married and has a seven-year- old daughter who's been very traumatised by her father's disappearance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interpol investigator Marius Dyssel said the disappearance of the two was being handled as a case of missing persons. He had interviewed both men who were to take the two into Angola and could not comment at this stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His next step was to travel to Angola to seek more information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A representative for the Department of Foreign Affairs said he could not comment on Pelser and Sweetnam's disappearance as the department was not notified of their trip to Angola or of their final destination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the department would advise businessmen wanting to invest in mining concessions in the north to notify the South African embassy in Luanda of their arrival, the names of the people they were to contact and the area in which they intended mining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben van Heerden, part-owner of a diamond-mining concession in northern Angola, who employed the four South Africans held hostage by Unita, underlined that warning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know about Pelser and Sweetnam and the circumstances surrounding their disappearance reeks of foul play,&quot; Van Heerden said. &quot;It is best to go into Angola in an official way by dealing directly with the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You're looking for trouble if you're on your own with lots of money in your pocket. If you go through proper channels, government officials can escort you to any corner of the country. But lots of South Africans have dollar signs in their eyes and they're blind to the dangers they're facing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Sun International is likely to end up with the lion's share of South African gambling licences despite being forced to cut back operations in some provinces. Southern Sun, a company once closely associated with Sun International, is also expected to be a major player, and a third operator is headed by a former Sun International executive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sun International is to remain in the gaming game as part of a consortium called African Sun International, which also includes Thebe Investments, Khulani Holdings, Real Africa Holdings, Vela International and the Women's Investment Portfolio.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a prediction in the latest edition of The RDP Quarterly Report, African Sun International will secure at least 10 of the 40 licences to be allocated nationally in terms of the National Gambling Bill, recently passed by Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A further 10 licences are likely to go to Tsogo Sun, a group which is owned in equal measure by Southern Sun and The Gaming Consortium. The Gaming Consortium includes black business groups Nafcoc and Fabcos, the National Council of Trade Unions, the South African Clothing and Textile Workers' Union and a community trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consortiums have been formed in line with the Act's requirement that gambling operations not be dominated by white-owned corporations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another major bidder is Global Resorts, founded by Ernie Joubert who was formerly Sun International's marketing director, with the backing of Rand Merchant Bank. Global resorts is expected to pick up about five licences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vienna-based Casinos Austria, which operates casinos in 15 countries, is next month to launch a consortium called Casino SA Consortium which could receive eight licences. Local partners in the consortium include businessman Reuel Khoza, chairman of Co-ordinated Network Investments and Innovative Resorts, and merchant bank FirstCorp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hendrik Brand, Sun International's legal affairs director, said the company was satisfied with the provisions of the Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the bill does not permit any operator to run more than two casinos in any one province, this has been stretched to three in the case of Sun International. In the Eastern Cape and North West, where most of Sun International's casinos survive from homeland days, the company has until May 1999 to trim its operations to the prescribed number. The Eastern Cape and North West have each been granted five licences in terms of the national plan, while Sun International currently operates seven casinos in each province.  There are no legislative requirements on how quickly the group gets rid of its licences, provided it has fallen into line with the law by 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brand said the company would pay attention to &quot;empowerment opportunities&quot; in disposing of its licences, with a view to bringing in new investors and ensuring jobs would not be lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The loss of the casinos in those two provinces would leave Sun International with fewer than 16 casinos nationwide, 16 being the limit prescribed by the Bill. This would allow the company to start casinos in other provinces, Brand said. Sun International is already looking at opportunities in the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bill has been sharply criticised by illegal casino operators, who face immediate closure, while Sun International has until 1999 to close down operations where required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brand dismissed these concerns: &quot;The individual entrepreneur cannot be ruled out. They can come on board through the consortiums.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brand added the Bill's provision for premises which could operate a limited number of gambling machines was an ideal opportunity for small investors.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Tensions between Free State Premier Patrick &quot;Terror&quot; Lekota and provincial ANC members are not over yet. A new storm is brewing which will see provincial MPs' loyalty to the premier tested in a vote in the Free State legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This follows the suspension of five senior officials from the province's Department of Trade and Industry. The suspended government officials have approached the provincial legislature arguing their suspension was not according to procedure, and the matter has been referred for investigation to the standing committee on trade and industry.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That committee happens to be chaired by Vax Mayekiso, the former MEC for housing who has had an uneasy relationship with the premier ever since being removed from his position after allegations of corruption last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After investigation by the committee, Mayekiso said the matter will be put to the vote before the legislature at its next meeting, later this month or early in August. This will prove the litmus test of claims which are made against Lekota -- if the ANC is as strongly against him as his detractors claim, caucusing among ANC members of the legislature could see the vote go against the premier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said there was evidence the officials had opened two bank accounts and spent without government authorisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He denied suggestions that the challenge by the suspended officials was part of a plot by his political enemies, and said the challenge posed no threat to his position: &quot;The suspensions have nothing to do with whether I'm premier.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provincial ANC chair Pat Matosa said there was &quot;general dissatisfaction&quot; with the way the premier had handled the suspension of the officials, and warned &quot;it may become a political issue&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lekota's position was first thought to be on the line three weeks ago, when accusations by the Free State ANC that the premier had acted unilaterally in reshuffling his cabinet prompted President Nelson Mandela to send a national ANC delegation to the Free State to mediate between Lekota and provincial ANC officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The visit by the ANC national delegation three weeks ago brought temporary respite to the tensions in the province, with all parties expressing their willingness to co-operate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The (ANC) provincial executive took the position I must stay on and resolve some of the problems,&quot; Lekota said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while provincial ANC secretary general Kaizer Sebothelo insists the previous meeting came to an amicable agreement, others in the ANC describe it as a &quot;smokescreen&quot; which concealed unresolved differences between the party and the premier.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - South Africa is well on its way to developing a child-sex tourism trade which could rival Thailand or the Philippines, child-care workers warn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For as little as food for their family's pots, children as young as eight can be bought in the Cape -- and very little is being done to stop the burgeoning trade in children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research has shown that in Cape Town the industry is increasingly organised, with children either abducted and forced into prostitution, or exploited by their parents to earn income for their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Durban and Johannesburg, reports are emerging of children being held as virtual prisoners in brothels and forced to service clients procured by their &quot;pimps&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South Africa has already created the fertile ground for the international body market and it is going to take an enormous effort to stop this from developing into a crisis as experienced in the Philippines, South America and the far east,&quot; said Bernadette van Vuuren of the children's rights organisation Resources Aimed at the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (Rapcan).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Vuuren was speaking at a workshop last week organised by the children's magazine Molo Songololo to highlight the commercial sexual exploitation of children. It was attended by 18 organisations which for the first time began sharing the information they have on child prostitution in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their initiative was sparked by an invitation to the South African government and non-governmental organisations to attend a world congress on commercial sexual exploitation of children in Sweden next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our research into the trade in children indicates that our country is a sitting duck for the infiltration of organisations which prey on vulnerable children in countries affected by poverty and low levels of protection for their most vulnerable,&quot; said Van Vuuren.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Cape Town, criminals have already begun exploiting the lucrative child- prostitute market. Van Vuuren said it was common knowledge on the Cape Flats that gangs controlled prostitution rings which abducted girls from their homes and sold them in Sea Point and the city centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These gangs are no longer the street-roaming gangsters of the past but have become organised and sophisticated in line with international standards.  The harsh reality is that communities are powerless to intervene in any way to stop this exploitation of their children,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children are often introduced to hard drugs like cocaine to ensure their cooperation with their gangster pimps who also supply them with drugs, or are beaten into submission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rent Boys&quot; have been operating for years in downtown Cape Town and street children -- boys and girls -- have often turned to prostitution as a way of earning money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Escort agencies, massage parlours and night clubs close to Cape Town's waterfront and harbour area have also allegedly been hiring young girls to &quot; entertain&quot; foreign seamen. Some set girls up in flats and pay them an allowance so they can be available exclusively when the seamen dock in South African ports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Taxi Queens&quot; is the term used in Mitchell's Plain to describe the sexual exploitation of young schoolgirls by taxi owners. The children are allegedly paid to sit up front and entertain drivers while they work and are then sexually exploited at the end of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent research into child prostitution conducted at schools in the Western Cape, the issue of what is commonly referred to as &quot;survival sex&quot; was highlighted. Children from those schools studied were being prostituted by either their families or as a result of being abandoned with no source of income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In rural areas children are sent to shebeens, migrant-labour hostels and to farm workers who pay either in cash or with food. &quot;Research indicates that this is a common reality in poverty-stricken communities in this country. A case was reported to us of an eight-year-old boy prostituted by his family as their only source of income,&quot; said Van Vuuren.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A social worker in the rural town of Napier recently conducted an awareness programme on sexual abuse at a school. By the end of the day 16 children had reported to her that they had been abused and by the end of the week she had 66 names.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Fortune, project manager of Streets, an organisation working with street children, agreed that many girls living on the streets turn to prostitution as a way of making money quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation runs a drop-in centre where street children are offered services including counselling and it is in these sessions where Streets measures the scale of child prostitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Typically, these girls have been abused at home and tend to have less self- worth because of their experiences. They believe they're enjoying some form of elusive freedom, that they are in control of their own lives without parental authority. But when they fall pregnant on the streets that myth is shattered,&quot; said Fortune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said most street children lived in groups and often the girls were sexually abused within the group and forced into prostitution as a way of earning money for their cohorts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His information was underscored by Renee Rossouw of Ons Plek, a shelter for street girls. But she said a survey conducted by the project had indicated that the percentage of street boys and girls involved in &quot;survival sex&quot; was equal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another Cape organisation which has been forced to confront the ugly reality of child prostitution is the Sex Workers' Education and Advocacy Taskforce (Sweat). Although the organisation was established to promote the health and safety of adult sex workers, they discovered children involved in the industry as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have found that prostitutes are vehemently opposed to forced sex work and child prostitution. They have told us that they are very worried about the increasing numbers of children involved in the industry and that some of their clients are requesting young children,&quot; said Sweat's psychologist and researcher, Ilse Pauw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the sex industry there are strong moral codes about what is right and wrong. The sex workers we deal with are outraged when they see under-aged children on the streets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inspector Ernie Riedeman of the Child Protection Unit said the unit did not have the capacity to do the kind of observation on the streets required to break child prostitute rackets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At present we have 900 cases with only 18 detectives in our unit. We have had some breakthroughs, like exposing the Internet site which advertised child prostitutes to tourists in Germany,&quot; Riedeman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisations agreed to continue sharing information, to lobby the government to take strong measures against child prostitution and to launch a campaign to highlight the problem publicly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African government will attend next month's international conference and has already submitted its amendments to a draft declaration and agenda for action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Financial Mail editor and Times Media Limited (TML) board member Nigel Bruce this week denied claims he is one of several interested parties vying to purchase the ailing magazine Finance Week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Absolutely not. I have no ambitions in that direction,&quot; Bruce said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Industry sources claimed this week that Bruce has been discussing a take- over of Finance Week together with Conrad Black, the Canadian media tycoon who owns the Telegraph group in Britain and who has a stake alongside Rupert Murdoch in Fairfax, the largest Australian newspaper group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finance Week editor Stuart Murray, who is also managing director and chairman of Finance Week Holdings, also denied that Bruce was negotiating to take over the magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed out that they were close friends and often met to discuss developments in the industry and exchange ideas. But a takeover of Finance Week by Bruce had not been a subject of discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media circles have been abuzz with rumours that Bruce, fearful of his position in TML -- in the face of a take-over by the black-owned National Empowerment Consortium -- has been negotiating a possible Finance Week takeover with the support of Black. TML chairman and Johnnic chief executive Vaughn Bray was said to be aware of Bruce's bid for the magazine. But Bray this week also denied any knowledge of Bruce's alleged approach to Finance Week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TML managing director Roy Paulson told the M&amp;G he would be &quot;surprised&quot; if Bruce went across to Finance Week as it was not an established publication in the market. He could not believe that Bruce would go it alone and leave a respected stable such as TML.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murray said several media stables are interested in the publication. &quot;We have been approached by several interested parties but I think it will be unfair to disclose who they are just yet,&quot; Murray said. They were all local groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murray has a pre-emptive right on shares which means he will have first refusal for the publication: &quot;Finance Week cannot be sold unless I know about it, or am afforded an opportunity first.&quot; He says an agreement was reached with majority shareholder Lynne Hill, wife of alleged fraudster Oliver Hill, facing extradition from London to South Africa. Lynne Hill is still based in London and has her lawyer managing business transactions on her behalf in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent Newspapers deputy chief executive Ivan Fallon said his group &quot; definitely did not&quot; approach Finance Week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The auditor who &quot;exposed&quot; mismanagement of R7,8- million by the former leadership of the ANC Women's League (ANCWL) is an old contact of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela -- and was embroiled in the controversy surrounding Hazel Crane's failed &quot;gift&quot; of a luxury Cape Town house to Madikizela-Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa this week confirmed the ANCWL national working committee was unhappy with Jeffrey Manning's audit. Senior ANCWL members told the Mail &amp; Guardian that Madikizela-Mandela, who is president of the ANCWL, had suggested Manning as an independent auditor last year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The working committee decided at a meeting this week -- where Madikizela- Mandela was not present -- to recommission the audit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manning -- whose qualifications to practice as an auditor in South Africa have been questioned -- earned R90 000 for the audit, which questioned the integrity of some of Madikizela-Mandela's foes in the organisation. Details of the audit were leaked to the media last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manning was a member of a close corporation, Edinburgh Drive Properties CC, which bought the Cape Town property last year after an attempt by Hazel Crane, a close friend of Madikizela-Mandela's and a convicted diamond dealer, to buy the R675 000 property as a &quot;gift&quot; for Madikizela-Mandela came to naught.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manning confirmed to the Sunday Times last March that he had bought the house &quot;as an investment&quot;, but claimed no connection with either Crane or Madikizela-Mandela. He was reported to be the sole member of Edinburgh Drive Properties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, details provided to the M&amp;G by the Registrar of Companies late last year showed that Crane's husband, Shai Avissar, was listed as a second member of the close corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Approached by the M&amp;G at the time, both Crane and Manning denied Avissar had any connection to the close corporation. Said Manning: &quot;He's never been a member. I formed the corporation ... Where the registrar got Shai Avissar I don't know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Manning did confirm: &quot;I know Shai and I know Hazel Crane and I know Mrs Mandela as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, Manning said: &quot;I purchased the house at Edinburgh Drive. It had nothing to do with Mrs Mandela.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had known her for &quot;a couple of years&quot; but had never &quot;done physical work&quot; for her, although he had advised her from time to time and been involved in &quot;the odd&quot; financial negotiation on her behalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior ANCWL member said this week she was &quot;surprised&quot; to learn of Manning and Mandela's earlier association, because Manning had been presented as an independent outsider by Madikizela-Mandela.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Details of an extraordinary secret hearing presided over by a former chief justice have thrown fresh light on the Reserve Bank's controversial rescue of two struggling banks over the past five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hearing was an arbitration of a dispute arising from the Reserve Bank's bail-out of the Cape Investment Bank (CIB). It emerges from statements made at the secret hearing by Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals that the bank donated money to the cash- strapped CIB.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from Stals's testimony, the hearing is significant because of almost exact parallels between the CIB package and the highly controversial Bankorp/Amalgamated Banks of South Africa (Absa) rescue. The Reserve Bank's legal department told the Mail &amp; Guardian the two transactions were, in principle, the same. But Stals and others have publicly described the higher profile Absa package as a loan -- not a gift -- which complies with international banking practice.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the secret hearing, Stals told Judge Pierre Rabie that &quot;like Father Christmas&quot; the Reserve Bank can give money to whichever institution it chooses -- such as the CIB which it sought to bail out to the tune of R15- million -- except that the shareholder, the government, could ask questions.  Rabie quoted Stals as saying the loan had been a &quot;simulated transaction&quot; and not a loan. Rabie concludes it was a gift and the bank never intended to make a loan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rabie, who retired in 1987 but stayed on as chief justice for two more years on contract, told the M&amp;G he had conducted the arbitration in his personal capacity. The Reserve Bank said this week the reference to &quot;Father Christmas&quot; was &quot;offered as a facetious example of a course of action that the bank, as a responsible corporate entity, could not contemplate following&quot;. It said the meeting was secret to &quot;avoid possible contravention of the Reserve Bank Act, in respect of persons other than the parties to the arbitration proceedings&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stals's remarks to Rabie, who retired in 1989, cast doubt on his public explanation this year of the Reserve Bank's R1,2-billion rescue of Bankorp, the collapsed bank swallowed by Absa in 1992. Although Stals and many others presented the controversial rescue package as a loan, many have argued it was, in fact, a gift.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February this year, Stals told a public enquiry that the Bankorp lifeboat was a loan which, as the &quot;lender of last resort&quot;, the Reserve Bank had been obliged to extend to protect the rest of the financial system from the likely collapse of Bankorp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the heart of these &quot;rescue&quot; transactions is the role central banks in all countries play in helping out commercial banks. Many countries allow central banks to provide emergency loans -- or &quot;lifeboats&quot; -- to struggling commercial banks. Like all loans, these &quot;lifeboats&quot; have to be repaid and strict conditions are attached to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite much speculation, the Bankorp lifeboat was kept secret until last October, when Absa came clean in advertisements countrywide. Absa said the Reserve Bank had insisted on it remaining secret to prevent a run on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public probing of the affair was championed by UK businessman Julian Askin, who is launching a legal attack in the British High Court against Absa for its behaviour in the Tollgate scandal. It was at an inquiry into the liquidation of transport conglomerate Tollgate that Stals spoke this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Askin bought control of the Tollgate consortium in 1990. Tollgate's bank, to which it owed debts, was TrustBank, a subsidiary of Bankorp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Askin says that when he bought Tollgate, TrustBank failed to tell him it was in trouble and was negotiating with the Reserve Bank for a rescue package which eventually became the lifeboat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Absa then put Tollgate into liquidation and started tapping into the five year lifeboat. Tollgate was one of a string of bad debtors Bankorp was saddled with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Absa charged Askin with fraud and theft of R70-million -- the same amount Askin says he found had gone missing when he was exploring Tollgate's accounts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Dirk Coetzee, the police hitman who first exposed the existence of death squads in the police, will not receive legal assistance from the government when he is arrested on Friday this week for the 1981 murder of human rights lawyer Griffiths Mxenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision not to pay Coetzee's legal costs, even though he has cooperated fully with the African National Congress and the government to expose third force operations in the apartheid era, is in stark contrast to the treatment of other other dirty tricks operatives currently on murder charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police are paying the full costs for Colonel Eugene de Kock, former commander of one of the most active death squads in the country, now facing more than 100 murder and fraud charges. The expenses of 19 murder suspects in the Magnus Malan trial are being paid by the South African National Defence Force. The combined costs of these two cases so far amounts to about R10- million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coetzee told the Mail &amp; Guardian he and another former hitman, Spyker Tshikalanga, would hand themselves to police on Friday. Both men expect to be freed on R1 000 bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision not to pay the legal fees and expenses incurred by Coetzee and other policemen involved in the forthcoming Mxenge murder trial was made in terms of a state regulation that officials who admit to criminal activities do not qualify for legal aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have been informed by the state attorney that we will have to pay all of our own costs including travel to and from Durban and lodging,&quot; said Coetzee. &quot;This shows that it is better for all those people who carried out human rights atrocities to deny this instead of coming clean. Despite all this talk of truth and reconciliation, the system rewards those who lie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth commission is known to be worried about the impact of Coetzee's recent comments on perpetrators who are considering whether or not to apply for amnesty, in return for full confessions about their involvement in human rights abuse during the apartheid era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police captain has stated publicly that he feels like a &quot;used condom&quot; and that it is not worth it for &quot;all those Dirk Coetzee's out there&quot; to reveal their past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coetzee also says he has been &quot;abandoned&quot; by the African National Congress.  The renegade policeman says the organisation promised support in exchange for his early and valuable information about hit- squad operations in the police during the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The policeman first revealed details about the notorious Vlakplaas unit to reporters from the Vrye Weekblad in 1989. &quot;An intermediary, Andre Zaaiman, went to Lusaka to the ANC looking for a deal for Dirk. He came back to Vrye Weekblad and told us the ANC would look after Dirk in return for a full confession,&quot; says former Weekblad reporter Jacques Paauw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'They never gave him an undertaking that he wouldn't be charged, because they couldn't. But they did agree to look after him. The ANC did do this until he got back from exile in London. And they also got him a job in the National Intelligence Agency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Coetzee is also bitter because the ANC allegedly failed to include him on the list of people who were indemnified against criminal prosecution before they came back into the country from exile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jacob Zuma, deputy head of ANC intelligence and Coetzee's handler in exile, was not available at the time of going to press to answer queries about whether his organisation would assist its members now being charged for crimes they helped expose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coetzee has applied for amnesty from the truth commission, but this had not been processed by the time an order for his arrest had been issued by the KwaZulu-Natal Attorney General Tim McNally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His trial could be postponed to allow his amnesty application to be heard only if the judge, AG and amnesty committee of the truth commission agree to do this.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Deputy President Thabo Mbeki has set up a secretive, 24- strong think-tank called the Consultative Council to give him political advice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All members of the group -- which appears to have no constitutional or administrative status despite its title -- are black. There are two women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Cabinet ministers are on the council -- Minister of Safety and Security Sydney Mufamadi and Defence Minister Joe Modise -- as well as Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Aziz Pahad.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other members of the group include Cosatu general secretary Sam Shilowa, City Press editor Khulu Sibiya, Kagiso Trust chief executive officer Eric Molobi and National Olympic Committee of South Africa president Sam Ramsamy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council meets monthly at Mbeki's official residence in Pretoria. The deputy president's parliamentary counsellor, Dr Essop Pahad, appears to act as convener.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two female members are Ann Letsebe, a lecturer at the Department of Social Work at the University of the Witwatersrand, and Durban-based human rights lawyer Linda Zama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five businessmen on the council are involved in African Renaissance Holdings, a broad-based investment syndicate. The chief executive of African Renaissance Holdings Bobby Makwetla is part of the group as well as a number of its directors -- Advocate &quot;MacCaps&quot; Motimele, Gabriel Mokgoko, Vincent Msibi, a Mmabatho-based doctor, and Seth Phalatse, who is manager of corporate planning at BMW.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Essop Pahad reluctantly confirmed the existence of the Consultative Council this week. &quot;It's a forum that he calls from time to time. It's meant to meet monthly, but it does not always happen. The people in the group were selected because it was thought that they might be able to offer the deputy president useful advice,&quot; Pahad said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a set number of people and I don't think that they should speak to you about it,&quot; he added. Most council members said they could not talk to the media about their membership, or the nature of the council's discussions, referring the M&amp;G to Essop Pahad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mufamadi denied the council was a kitchen cabinet, or that it was an exclusive sounding board, or club: &quot;I would imagine that a person who was involved in policy-making processes would avoid insulating himself from people who are involved in activities affecting those processes,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The deputy president felt the need to be in dynamic contact with as many people as possible who are either involved in the ANC, but at the ground level, or who are involved with the community in various formations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another member of the council, Windsor Shuenyane, managing director of South African Breweries Centenary Centre in Newtown, Johannesburg, said the council was a way for the deputy president to hear the voice of South Africa's many constituencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The deputy president wanted to be involved at ground level and hear the concerns of every constituency. All major constituencies are represented in this group,&quot; Shuenyane said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a general consensus that it is a confidential task group. We are just meeting and, for example, when the press goes hard at the deputy president we may talk about it and discuss what might be the cause. There is a member of the press there -- City Press editor Khulu Sibiya -- and he will contribute for the press, say how the press is thinking ... yes, there is quite a lot of discussion about the press,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The City Press editor would not comment on his position in the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of the Development Bank of Southern Africa, Professor Wiseman Nkuhlu, said the council was in line with emerging black business and community interests. He said he concentrated on discussions on development and black economic empowerment which were his particular interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A striking aspect of the council is the absence from its ranks of some of the most influential members of the new black business community -- people like Nthatho Motlana, chairman of New African Investments Ltd, the Kunene brothers of Kunene Investments, Vusi Khanyile of Thebe Investments, veteran businessman Richard Maponya and Mohali Mahanyele, head of National Sorghum Breweries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other members of Mbeki's Consultative Council are: Professor Ephraim Mokgokong, rector of the Medical University of Southern Africa, Medunsa; Dr Vincent Maphai, director of the Department of Social Dynamics at the Human Sciences Research Council; M Maisela, marketing manager of Multi-Choice South Africa; Umtata-based T Boltina; ANC MP Dr Wally Serote; Professor P Zulu and general secretary of the South African Communist Party, Charles Ngakula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said the organisation's other senior leaders had not been involved in the selection of the group. &quot;We have confidence in the deputy president and we believe that he has established a consultative forum in the best interests of the country so he can explore its richness beyond the government and the alliance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An ANC MP, who did not wish to be named, said there would be some surprise in the party at the composition of the council. &quot;It's not my dream team.  There will be members of the ANC who won't be enamoured of this list,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - AS Zambia approaches it's first national elections since the advent of multi-party democracy,more women are anxious for places as political candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This came to light during a discussion on women as candidates between Zambia and America which was held at the American Centre in Lusaka.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia Democratic Congress representative, Susan Jere said Zambian women having been placed in an awkward position through traditions and cultural practices are fighting to convince society that they are credible political candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the current situation of only seven women out of the 150 members of parliament shows that it would take a long time before women can have a fair representation in parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And political director of the women's campaign fund in the US, Ms. Amy Walter, urged the National Women's lobby group in Zambia to identify a small number of women whom they would help financially if they are to succeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said if they decide to help all the women candidates, the vision of the campaign fund would not succeed because there would be too many women who would want to benefit from the funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Walter further urged the Zambian women to support the women who are current MPs and learn from them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She cautioned the would be women candidates that it is extremely expensive to carry out a viable campagin if one is doing it for the first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Walter also urged women who are aspiring for political positions to make themselves known in the communities in which they wish to stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said this would help them to compete successfully against male candidates who are already known by the electorate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Environment and Natural Resources Minister William Harrington has said his government maintains the policy of conservation a priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said when the MMD government took office in 1991 it realised the need to strengthen the Environmental Council of Zambia to monitor environmental concerns and to provide solutions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said government recognised the importance of awareness and that was why environmental education was incorporated in the country's national education policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Harrington was speaking when he opened a weeklong Wildlife Conservation Society of Zambia training workshop at the Cooperative College in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said years of neglect and lack of concern for conservation issues resulted in rundown infrastructure and deplorable living conditions for Zambians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told workshop participants drawn from primary, secondary and college lecturer-leaders of conservation clubs all over the country that the onus was on them to provide environmentally friendly attitudes in their students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He directed the teachers to impart environmental conservation education through recognising values and clarifying concepts to children who would later teach their parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministry of environment enjoyed sound partnership with the wildlife conservation of zambia in the area of combating environmental degradation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many schools were benefiting in terms of supplementary education materials provided through the chongololo and conservation education programmes and the teachers were getting conected to the international world in the field of environmental conservation education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people of Zambia are indebted to the efforts of the wildlife conservation society of Zambia which is disseminating informationon environmental and species protection,&quot; said Mr Harrington.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Belgian Embassy in Zambia will be closing at the end of August for financial reasons and both the Ambassador, Mr Luc Willemark and Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister, Dr Peter Machungwa confirmed the development in Lusaka today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Willemark said in an interview that the embassy was closing due to budgetary constraints back home and not political developments in Zambia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his government is also closing Consulates in some European countries and some embassies in Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Willemark said, however, that the co-operation section and the Belgium programmes in Zambia will continue to operate as before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He emphasised that the closure was purely on budgetary reasons and not political ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Head of the Development Co-operation Section at the Belgian Embassy, Dirk Teerlinck, assured that development programmes though few will be continued adding that though he himself was pulling out of Zambia on Saturday this did not mean the end of everything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Machungwa said his ministry was aware of the closure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the officials from the embassy informed the Zambian government that they were going to wind up business in Zambia at the end of next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said that reasons are that Belgium is finding it difficult to maintain some of its missions abroad due to the structural adjustment programme that she has embarked on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reasons are just like the ones we are experiencing here in Zambia. We are also closing some embassies and High Commissions which we can't maintain,&quot; Dr Machungwa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He explained that the closure had nothing to do with the adoption of ammendments to the Republican Constitution which will restrict the presidency to second generation citizens.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Zambia National Farmers Union (ZNFU) president Ben Kapita yesterday challenged the government to justify the legality of the K30 million each tax free gratuities to Members of Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a press statement released yesterday, Kapita said &quot;poverty in rural areas is continuing to increase.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government always blames lack of funds for the lack of development in rural areas but can easily find K4.5 billion - more than double a national rural assistance programme - to pay itself a gratuity,&quot; Kapita's statement read in part. &quot;Many rural MPs have rarely toured their constituencies to discuss problems and development programmes, how can they justify the K30 million tax free gratuity when they have not even started to do the job they were elected for?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kapita said that the hefty gratuity was more than double the K2 billion given out for the over 600,000 small scale farmers this year under the Rural Investment Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No MP can justify a gratuity that is ten thousand times greater than the money that government is prepared to make available to a farmer,&quot; Kapita said.  &quot;The decision taken by the government was daylight robbery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief government spokesman, Amusaa Mwanam-wambwa, yesterday refused to comment on Kapita's charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Penza last Friday told the Lusaka Press Club that all MPs including those &quot;who had just been sleeping in Parliament during their term of office&quot; were justified to get their gratuity as they were still doing their work &quot; part of which also includes sleeping in the house&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The elections office yesterday announced that the inspection of voters registers has been postponed until further notice in Lusaka, Central and Copperbelt provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The postponement follows the non arrival of voters cards for the three provinces from the United States where they were being printed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Electoral Commission will prescribe new dates for the three provinces as soon as the cards arrive from America,&quot; Elections Office spokesman, Joel Sikazwe announced yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) secretary general, Derrick Chitala, charged that the move showed an intention to subvert the electoral process. &quot; Unless the whole process is free and fair, there will be no elections,&quot; warned Chitala in an interview yesterday. &quot;It's in the interest of the whole nation that we sit urgently to dialogue otherwise President Chiluba will be held responsible for subverting the democratic process. The whole electoral process is a sham.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And UNIP chairman, retired General Malimba Masheke, charged that the move was ill-intended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Copperbelt, Lusaka and Central Provinces constitute the heaviest number of registered voters compared to the whole country.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The government was yesterday urged by the Peasant Farmers Union of Zambia chairman, Patrick Kayeka, to intervene in the importation of grain bags to save his members from losing their grain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kayeka who has just returned from a field tour of Luapula Province revealed that there was a severe shortage of grain bags countrywide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Farmers fear losing their maize as there is a severe shortage of empty grain bags,&quot; Kayeka said in an interview yesterday. &quot;And in cases where the bags are found they are too expensive for the farmers to buy due to the shortage.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And sources at the Agricultural Market Information at the Ministry of Agriculture estimated the current stock of empty grain bags at just over 5 million against the needed 15.6 million for this year's harvest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its bid to liberalise the agro sector the government had left the marketing of the grain bags to the private sector but farmers cannot afford them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bags are going for prices in the range of K1,500 and K2,000. And if you look at last year's price of K500 you will realise that the bags are now too expensive considering the low returns maize offers the farmer,&quot;JKayeka carped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when contacted for comment, acting permanent secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture, Mulele Mulele, said government would give a statement later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And last season's heavy rains have badly affected beans production in the Eastern Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year's harvest has been termed as &quot;extremely&quot; low, leading to fears of a shortage in the Province and the hiking of prices in the long term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This year's 'good rains' have affected beans production,&quot; disclosed Alick Mbewe, manager of the Danish funded Muchilakubili Agricultural Project, in an interview in Lusaka yesterday. &quot;The crop yield is affected by humidity and following the heavy rains the entire Province has suffered a poor harvest this season. The figures are really bad. &quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlanta - Security concerns at the games' village in Atlanta are making life difficult for journalists covering the games, whether accredited or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been very difficult for journalists to get in touch with athletes and officials at the village, because of tough instructions from the Atlanta Committee for the Games (ACOG) to the effect that journalists must be escorted into the village by their countries' chef of mission, a tough condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A NAN correspondent seeking to interview some athletes and officials at the village had to spend hours at the gate without luck. Several journalists have now pitched their tents right in front of the gate to enable them &quot;ambush&quot; athletes and officials going in and out of the village. -----</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though journalists are said to be known for their whining, they are not the only ones complaining about problems at the centennial games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlantans themselves seem to be overwhelmed by the thousands of visitors who have descended on their town, the resulting strain on public utilities and other inconveniences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And smart entrepreneurs are cashing in on the people's feelings, forming an &quot;organisation &quot; called &quot; Atlantans disgusted with the games (ADOG)&quot; -- a bastardisation of the name of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) -- and offering T-shirts and other memorabilia for sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization's mascot is a blue dog called &quot;pizzy&quot;, as against the games' mascot, &quot;Izzi&quot;. -----</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa is in Atlanta, apparently to help lobby for cape town's bid for the 2004 games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the archbishop denies that his presence at the games has anything to do with lobbying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't come to lobby but to meet people and to sell the idea that Cape Town is capable of hosting the Olympic games,&quot; he told correspondents outside the games village.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A picture of the retired archbishop's flashing a victory sign is on the cover of the official magazine of the bid committee, which is being widely distributed in Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have proved it to ourselves and to the world that South Africa is a country where we can dream dreams, and where those dreams actually come true,&quot; he wrote in the 23-page magazine titled &quot;2004&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigerian work supervisors had to show leniency Wednesday morning towards the employees who reported late, after staying awake into the early morning hours, to watch the nation's under-23 soccer team beat Japan 2-0 in the 1996 Olympic Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The much-fancied Japanese, after their 1-0 victory over Brazil, had been dubbed &quot;giant killers&quot; in group 'D' which also includes Hungary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of time difference, the much-talked about match in Orlando, Florida, kicked off at 1.30 AM Lagos time (12.30 GMT).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the shanty-community of Ajegunle to high-brow Ikoyi and Victoria Island, Lagosians were awake, giving what a commentator called &quot;spiritual and moral support&quot; to the national team in far-way Orlando.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many residents had their afternoon nap Tuesday to prepare themselves for the &quot;night vigil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were glued to their television sets for the encounter, with hundreds, mostly youths pouring into the streets, drumming and dancing at the end of the tension-soaked match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In several residential quarters, those who watched the encounter at drinking houses continued the celebration until late in the morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But before then, anxiety had almost gave way to frustration, when the Nigerian team failed to penetrate the Japanese defence and score goals during the entire first half.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, the first goal by Tijani Babangida, seven minutes to the end of the match, was greeted with deafening applause that reverbrated across the city of six million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerians, who had in their opening match defeated Hungary 1-0 on Sunday, sealed the Japanese hope in the 90th minute through an Austin 'Jay- Jay' Okacha penalty kick after a defender grabbed the ball in Japan's vital area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goal was greeted by another rapture from the Nigerians watching the match on television at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The boys are fantastic,&quot; said a trader, James Akele, in a comment that summarised the mood of the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, sports journalist Jide Adebayo said the fact that Nigeria would defeat Japan was never in doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;History is on Nigeria's side,&quot; he said, citing two previous ecounters between the two countries during the King Fahd Inter-continental Championship in Saudi Arabia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Adebayo warns that Nigeria should watch out against Brazil, in their last group match, as the South Americans have always had an upper hand against Nigeria in soccer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Brazilians Tuesday crushed Hungary 3-1 in their second match to win their first three points.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ORLANDO, United States (PANA) - Nigeria's under-23 national soccer team secured a place into the next round of the Atlanta games following its 2-0 victory over Japan here early Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Nigerian team handlers conceded after the match that the Japanese were a hard nut to crack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a post-match press conference, Nigeria's technical adviser, Bonfrere Jo, said that the Japanese played well, making the match very &quot;difficult&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the pattern of play the Japanese demonstrated in their match with Nigeria showed that their victory against Brazil Sunday was not a fluke.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Nigerian sports minister, Jim Nwobodo, said that he was very happy with the outcome of the &quot;wonderful&quot; match. He asserted that his presence brought good fortunes to the team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I came all the way from Atlanta to watch this match because I believe it is a crucial match in the preliminaries,&quot; he delightedly told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of the Nigeria football association, retired Air Commodore Emeka Omeruah, said that the result was a manifestation of hard work and prayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe that the boys are beginning to show their mettle, that they are very good and we hope that this would be the beginning of good things to happen,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if we are able to go to Miami and play well again, then we are sure that we are going to get there,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victory gave Nigeria six points and shot it to the top of group D, where a mere tie would ensure its qualification for the quarter-finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the group's other match, Brazil took its anger out on Hungary, beating the Europeans 3-1, to tie with Japan at three points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerians will next see action against Brazil in Miami on Thursday, in a match that promises a lot of excitement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Ghana, the Barcelona Games bronze medalist, kept its hopes alive with a 3-2 victory over Italy in a group C match in Washington D.C. Wednesday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Korea and Mexico tied 0-0 in the group's other match.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The concept of combining traditional and modern medicine, which was pioneered in Zimbabwe at independence in 1980, is fast spreading to other African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barbara Sibanda, founder member of the traditional and medical clinic which this week celebrates 15 years of the unique experiment, told Zimbabwe Inter- Africa News Agency that Ghana, Malawi, Nigeria and Zambia were among the African countries that were studying the Zimbabwean experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concept gives patients a choice between modern and traditional medicine under one roof and practitioners from either side liaise over the most likely successful form of remedy for an ailment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our success rate has been as good as any health delivery system. The choice for the patient is now wider, some kind of revolution in medical practice,&quot; said Sibanda. Her Bulawayo-based clinic employs a full-time medical practitioner, a traditional healer and midwives for its 25-bed maternity wing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sibanda established her clinic in 1981, amid stiff opposition from the medical profession. She has since opened the first rural outpost in Sigola communal lands on the outskirts of Bulawayo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outpost, which Sibanda described as fully subscribed, also runs a free immunisation programme for the under-fives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1995 the clinic also introduced spiritual healing to cater for patients who believed in god.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sibanda said those with faith-healing powers conducted their healing sessions in an adjacent wing. There were also plans to set up a theatre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said major ailments often referred to traditional healers by the medical practitioner included infertility, asthma, epileptic fits and mental problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clinic which charges slightly lower rates for consultation and herbs, handles up to 100 patients per day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sibanda added that the concept was gaining recognition in most sub-Saharan African countries where, despite the advent of modern medicine over a century ago, up to 80 percent of African people had faith in traditional herbal treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The anniversary this week is to consolidate the contribution of traditional medicine to the health delivery system and demonstrate how the two can harmoniously be combined to produce good, even better results,&quot; said Sibanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guests invited to the celebrations include Zimbabwe's health and child welfare minister, Dr. Timothy Stamps, a medical practitioner who has publicly disapproved of claims by traditional healers that they had found a cure for the deadly AIDS pandemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president of the 40,000-member Zimbabwe National Traditional Healers Association, Gordon Chavhunduka, and that of the International Organization of Traditional and Medical Practitioners and Researchers, are also expected to attend.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Eleven soldiers who have spent six years in prison for their alleged complicity in a failed coup against former Nigerian military ruler, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, have been freed, military sources said in Lagos Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their release followed action initiated on their behalf by the human rights group, Civil Liberties Organisations, the sources said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Babangida beat off two coup attempts before he quit office in August 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first, led by his former friend, Gen. Mamman Vatsa, was foiled in December 1985. Vatsa and other officers implicated in the coup were executed, while others were imprisoned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 20, 1990, another group of military men led by Maj. Gideon Orkar staged another coup attempt against the Babangida regime, in which several soldiers and civilians were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 70 soldiers, tried by a special court after the second coup, were executed, while a number of other military men received prison sentences, some for life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Babangida handed over power Aug. 26 ,1993, to an interim national government led by a businessman, Ernest Shonekan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Nov. 17, the Shonekan government was overthrown in a palace coup mounted by Gen. Sani Abacha, Nigeria's current head of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abacha was a key figure in the Babangida regime and was defence minister in the interim government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) - The Sudanese army announced here Wednesday that two of its soldiers got killed in Sunday's battle near the border with Eritrea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Army spokesman Gen. Mohamed Sanousi Ahmed said in a communique, published by the state-owned newspaper, al- Sudan al-Hadeith, and Akhbar al Youm, an independent daily, that an infantry unit, assisted by armoured vehicles, Sunday attacked the Sudanese border post of Jebel Abu Gamul.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the statement did not specify whether the attacking forces were Eritrean or anti-Khartoum government dissidents based in that neighboring country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It only said the Sudanese forces confronted the invading forces with strength and bravery forcing them to retreat into Eritrea, leaving behind several of their number dead. The number of enemy killed was not given.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports of Sunday's border fighting were first broken Tuesday by the Sudan News Agency (SUNA) which did not speak of any government army losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement said the army was in full control of the situation and that the government troops and the citizens in the area were ready to repulse any aggression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eritrea cut off diplomatic relations with Sudan at the end of 1994, amid claims that Khartoum was inciting moslem Eritreans against the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khartoum denied the accusation, alleging Asmara severed the relations under pressure from some Western quarters, in return for financial assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan got embittered early in 1995 when an alliance of banned Sudanese political parties held a conference in the Eritrean capital, Asmara. The opponents declared their intention to topple the government of Gen. Omar Bashir by military means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exiles charged Abdul Aziz Khalid, an army officer who defected from the Sudanese army, with the task of raising an army in eastern Sudan and to launch an armed struggle against the Bashir government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MBABANE, Swaziland (PANA) - Thousands of teachers and civil servants in Swaziland will get a pay shock this week, when government applies a &quot;No Work - - No Pay&quot; policy following their illegal strike in June and early July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teachers, members of the Swaziland National Association of Teachers (SNAT), will lose 18 days pay in their July salary cheques and 15 days in August.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pay cuts were confirmed by the Secretary to the Cabinet, Frank Bucham, Wednesday, to the teachers' and civil servants' leaders when negotiations over their 18 per cent salary increase demands resumed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders were further warned that their associations also faced the risk, under the kingdom's law, of being banned for the illegal strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President of the teachers association, Meshack Masuku, and his civil servants counterpart, Absolom Dlamini, expressed shock and anger at the tough line taken by the government and threatened to seek the king's intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teachers said the pay cuts were unnecessary because they had agreed to teach overtime on Saturdays and during the August holidays to make up for work days lost during their strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The civil servants claimed they were being punished unfairly because they had been forced to join the strike by gangs who had threatened violence against them if they continued working.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bucham said the two associations could face further penalties for contempt of an industrial court order that they return to work.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - Four Southern African leaders began meeting in Maputo Wednesday to find possible solutions to problems in Swaziland where trade unions and human rights groups are demanding democratic changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who chairs the troika of Southern African leaders that helped solve problems in Lesotho in 1994, arrived here Wednesday morning to join South Africa's President Nelson Mandela, Botswana's Ketumile Masire and host President Joquaim Chissano.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">King Mswati 111 of Swaziland sent acting Prime Minister Sishayi Nxumalo for the talks, being held at the Ponta Vermelha state house on the Indian ocean front.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nxumalo is expected to brief the leaders on the latest developments in his country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tiny mountain kingdom of Swaziland, the only Southern African country in which political parties are banned, has for more than year been hit by a series of pro-democracy strikes and has been under mounting international pressure to return to democratic rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">King Sobhuza 11, Mswati's father, outlawed all political parties in Swaziland when he introduced emergency rule in 1973, suspending at the same time the Westminster-style constitution inherited at independence in 1968.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Southern African leaders, without Chissano, met in Pretoria, South Africa, in March where the situation in Swaziland was also discussed and King Mswati III promised to take action towards constitutional reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will consult the nation on which way to go forward from here,&quot; he said, adding that he would &quot;move swiftly with the people of Swaziland&quot; to institute constitutional reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most active in pushing for constitutional reforms has been the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions, which has been joined by opposition political parties and now formed as the Swaziland Democratic Alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">King Mswati in May announced he had set up a People's Parliament at Ludzidzini, 50 miles south of the capital Mbabane, which would start hearing constitutional submissions by ordinary Swazis that same month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The monarch also said a constitutional committee and the Swaziland National Council would also be set up in May as part of the moves towards democratic reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, trade unions and political parties are convinced the king, who has absolute authority over the country's 900,000 people, is buying time and has no intention of lifting the 1973 decree banning political activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States and Britain are some of the powerful countries supporting constitutional reforms in Swaziland. British Overseas Development Minister Lynda Chalker has told the monarch delays could result in &quot;radical elements&quot; hijacking the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the South African Press Association reports that King Mswati has invited the Swazi people to a national meeting at Ludzidzini royal kraal Friday where he is expected to announce the members of a new constitutional committee responsible for implementing the constitutional review.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwe's largely heterosexual society, repulsed by homosexuality, could be heading for a showdown with an increasingly assertive and foreign-backed gay and lesbian lobby, which is refusing to stay cooped up in closets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Gay and Lesbian Association of Zimbabwe (GALZ) has successfully applied to participate and exhibit their material at the forthcoming Zimbabwe International Book Fair (ZIBF) scheduled for July 30 to August 03.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The association and their sympathizers see this as a victory following the 1995 controversy during which they were banned from exhibiting at the fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An international furor was created when Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe viciously attacked gays and lesbians as sexual perverts and sodomists, and threatened to have them locked up if they publicised their activities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we accept homosexuality as a right, as is being argued, what moral fibre shall our society ever have to deny organized drug addicts, or even those given to bestiality the rights they might claim under the rubric of individual freedom and human rights including the freedom of the press to write, publish and publicise?&quot; asked Mugabe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has again banned GALZ from exhibiting at the 1996 book fair to &quot;protect and guarantee the cultural health of Zimbabwe from possible erosion&quot; and has berated organizers of the exposition for having allowed them to participate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the association and its members say they will not be bullied into withdrawing from the book fair and will proceed with their participation on the same terms as any other approved exhibitor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority of Zimbabweans strongly oppose the sexual preferences of gays and lesbians on religious, cultural and moral grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe's attack on gays and lesbians in 1995, which had the full support of local writers, appeared to have silenced GALZ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But not to be cowed, GALZ launched a counter worldwide campaign against &quot; persecution&quot; which resulted in demonstrations against Mugabe in South Africa, Nigeria and some European countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GALZ's planned re-entry into the book fair could therefore illustrate Zimbabwe's vulnerability to pressure of international politics and donor funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesperson for the Netherlands embassy here in Harare has justified the Dutch government's support for GALZ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We as a nation fully understand the plight of GALZ and are in full support of their fight to be treated equally. We feel they should not be discriminated against for any reason. It is a fundamental human right,&quot; said the spokesperson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the height of the 1995 controversy, at least three ZIBF trustees sympathetic to GALZ resigned and there were veiled threats of the traditional book fair donors influencing the relocation of the annual exposition to South Africa where gays and lesbians are recognized and protected by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus, the return of GALZ is being viewed by the majority of Zimbabweans as arm-twisting by foreign donors and a slap in the face of culture, religion and morality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In our culture you do not exhibit sex. It is taboo. I do not want my five- year old daughter to see information not suitable for her. We know they have a right to their sexual preferences but not in public. In our culture we select things according to age, sex, even customs,&quot; says writer Cont Mhlanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The power of donor funding is clear here. He who pays the piper calls the tune. Because they are giving us money they are dictating the standards of our morality,&quot; laments Pathisa Nyathi, a cultural activist who sits on the ZIBF board of trustees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appears the decision to allow GALZ'S participation was imposed by an invisible force outside the ZIBF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trustees, George Kahari and Nyathi claim that the issue was never discussed during preparatory meetings for the 1996 fair, only for them to read about it in newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The board is against their practise and the majority of them are not aware of their participation. We will never accept that as part of our culture,&quot; says Kahari.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZIBF executive director, Trish Mbanga defends the organization's decision as democratic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not forcing people to go and look at the material they have no interest in, no one is going to say look at this, look at that,&quot; she told a local television panel discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although government has said it will continue to oppose GALZ's participation, it has somewhat scaled down the 1995 aggressive stance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We expect the organizers to respect our culture. We are going to tell them that we do not accept that,&quot; says Nathan Shamuyarira, the country's industry and commerce minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But writer Mhlanga believes Zimbabwe lost the battle against GALZ in 1995 when Mugabe's attacks gave the world the impression of persecution of minority rights, particularly during an international event on human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And because of GALZ's powerful links the whole issue has been politicized as a human rights issue and oppression of the minority. We should have adequately prepared to deal with the issue because it is not going to disappear,&quot; says Mhlanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It remains to be seen whether the GALZ exhibition at the book fair will go ahead without any disturbances from their opponents, among them Mugabe who has vowed at various international fora that he would never allow gays and lesbians to do as they please in his country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, a Harare-based pressure group, Sangano Munhumutapa, has promised that should GALZ exhibit at the book fair, they would burn down its stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They can do what they want with their bodies in the privacy of their homes, but certainly not to exhibit at the book fair,&quot; says Lawrence Chakaredza, president of the pressure group linked with the university of Zimbabwe students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Sangano Munhumutapa's threat is to be taken seriously, and if GALZ and its members are determined to defy the government ban and make a showing at the book fair, then a showdown is almost certain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria's under-23 soccer squad, the Eagles, face a tough task Friday morning in Miami when they play Brazil, world soccer giants, in the last 'Group D' match of the centennial Olympiad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After snatching the maximum points in their matches against Hungary and Japan, Nigeria's &quot;dream team,&quot; is poised for an all-out war on the Brazilians to prove a number of points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barring the unexpected, Nigeria, one-time under-17 world soccer champion, would like to prove that it is equally capable of bringing home its first Olympic gold.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Eagles will also be anxious to prove that Brazil is not invincible and leave behind them previous embarrassments and defeats suffered at their hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will be the third time both countries are meeting at the Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Mexico Olympics in 1968 the Nigerians, leading 3-0, allowed the Brazilians to come from behind and level matters before regulation time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Seoul in 1988, when they last played Brazilians, they were walloped 4-0.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should Nigeria make it to the quarter-finals, it will be the first time that the country will go beyond the preliminaries of the Olympic soccer event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Brazilians, despite their 0-1 defeat by Japan, are still book- makers favourites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South Americans will be desperate in their third encounter with the West Africans. They know a loss means doom. A mere draw will not help matters either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria is currently leading the group while Brazil is at par with Japan, except for a superior goal advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the same day Ghana, Africa's other representative still in the race, will battle against 'Group C' leaders, Mexico, in a bid to grab a quarter- final ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unexpected 1-0 defeat of the Barcelona '92 bronze medallists had put them in a tight corner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They had to fight from 1-2 down to beat Italy 3-2 on Tuesday in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A draw against Mexico may guarantee them a place in the quarter finals, provided Korea does not beat Italy with a large goal margin.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ATLANTA, United States (PANA) - The president of the Association of Olympic Committees in Africa (ANOCA), Jean Claude Ganga, has urged African athletes competing in the on-going Olympic games to put out their best in their various fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want all our athletes to bear in mind that the entire African continent is solidly behind them as they compete against the rest of the world and we want them to put in their best&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ganga charged the athletes to prove to the rest of the world that they can conquer the world in sports and use sports to make up for Africa's inability to send somebody to the moon.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The time has come when African athletes should be given the desired respect in sports&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ganga, who is also the president of the national Olympic committee of Congo, praised South African swimmer, Penny Heyns, who has so far won two gold medals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I sincerely believe that the medals will flow in for Africa when the track and field events begin on July 26,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stressed that Nigerian, South African, Kenyan, Somalian, Ethiopian and Mozambican athletes are capable of winning medals in the track and field events, adding: &quot;I know they will do their best to carry our various flags to high places&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the protest of the Nigeria Olympic committee over the blackout of its contingent by the NBC TV during the opening ceremony, Ganga said he was backing the committee and was very concerned about the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am backing the Nigerian Olympic committee because Nigeria is one of the biggest countries in Africa and does not deserve the treatment she received from the American television network NBC,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had already taken the matter to the international Olympic committee, and the local organizing committee to ensure that the incident does not happen again.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reportedly apologised for statements by members of his cabinet who had accused Southern African leaders of meddling in the internal affairs of his country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Chiluba apologised for some of the rude remarks made by some of his colleagues,&quot; President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe told a news conference in Maputo Wednesday at the end of a Southern African Development Community meeting to discuss Swaziland, where the monarch is under pressure to introduce democratic reforms.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministers had particularly accused SADC leaders of making statements in support of former President Kenneth Kaunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not interfering in the internal affairs of Zambia. But if we see any developments that we view and interpret as signs of conflict, we cannot keep quiet. If there are such signs in Zimbabwe my colleagues can seek an explanation,&quot; said Mugabe who was flanked by his colleagues in the newly- formed SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and Security, South African President Nelson Mandela, Ketumile Masire of Botswana and host President Joaquim Chissano.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was responding to a question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia, hit by a wave of bomb attacks and violent demonstrations after amending the constitution to bar Kaunda from running for president again, is being monitored by the SADC organ which is anxious that the situation may worsen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe said the SADC organ was not happy with the events in Zambia. &quot;We want to see Zambia move in a direction of peace and stability.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NANYUKI, Kenya (PANA) - The third general assembly of the Forum for African Women Educationalists (FAWE) opened here Thursday with a call for a shift of emphasis towards girls outside schools to esure their integration into the maistream of African education systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening the meeting, Kenya's Education Minister Joseph Kamotho said it was important to ensure that all girls enrol and are retained in schools until they complete their education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that while girls in schools needed moral and financial support, those who drop out of school because of pregnancy should also be assisted and readmitted into the school system to continue their studies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assembly is taking place at the equatorial town of Nanyuki some 250 km north of Nairobi, the Kenyan capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have not given adequate attention to the girl who is outside the school, 'The Missing Girl', and this forum of distinguished women educationalists should deliberate adequately on the plight of the girls out of school,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kamotho noted that while African countries had increased primary school enrolments between 1990 and 1995, the growth rate in enrolment by girls advanced very slightly to 45.8 percent in 1995 from 45.4 percent in 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nineteen countries in sub-Saharan Africa, in fact registered a significant percentage decrease in the participation of girls while there was an improvement in net enrolment ratio. The ratio for boys reached 65.7 percent compared with 56.1 percent for girls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged the delegates to make firm recommendations to their governments on how to improve access, equity and quality of the education of girls at primary, secondary, university and tertiary levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turning to the Kenyan situation, Kamotho said girls' schools were performing better than their male counterparts. Over half of the top 20 positions were taken by girls' schools in national examinations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kamotho added that the government had launched a program of finding 'The Missing Girl'- by introducing formal education for the street girls and others who drop out of school, so that they can continue with their education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Introducing the minister, FAWE chairperson Gennet Zewide, who is also the Ethiopian education minister, said that the forum had created 19 national chapters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two-day meeting has brought together some 46 leading African educationalists, who include university vice-chancellors and professors and education ministers from 27 Africa countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The forum is being held on African soil for the first time. The first and second in 1992 and 1994 congresses were held in Bellagio, Italy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria Airways is to resume flights from Lagos to New York under a partnership agreement it has signed with the United States airline, World Airways, it was announced here Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria Airways managing director, Group Captain Peter Gana, told reporters late Wednesday in Lagos the flights would resume August 1.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flights were stopped in October 1994 due to a number of reasons, including alleged drug trafficking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a retaliatory move, Nigeria also withdrew landing rights from American Airways, which was then flying on the New York-Lagos-New York route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under new the agreement, passengers from Nigeria will be flown to Dakar, capital of Senegal, from where they would board World Airlines for their journey to New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gana said the partnership agreement's negotiations were concluded in June in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the new agreement solves the problem Nigerians were facing in obtaining transit visas when travelling through European capitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To get to New York, travellers from Lagos had to use a foreign airline ( Swiss Air, KLM, Sabena, Lufthansa, Air France). They also had to transit through the countries of origin of these flights, hence the need for transit visas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nigerians do not need a transit visa to go to Senegal. This will save our passengers a few more dollars. It will also save travel time,&quot; Gana said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Gana, passengers would be taken to Dakar aboard a Nigerian Airways aircraft.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">protested against the escalation of violence in Burundi and all acts which interfer with the peace process in that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As events of the last few days show, a climate of generalised terror has been created which prevents all attempts at dialogue, slows the return to security and stability and compromises peace initiatives undertaken at the national, regional and international levels, notably those begun in Arusha, Tanzania,&quot; he said in a statement issued in Paris Wednesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saying that he was greatly concerned by the tragic situation in Burundi, which is characterized by the repeated murder of innocent civilians and the weakening of its institutions, Mayor appealed to the political and military authorities as well as to the Burundian people that the force of reason may prevail over the reason of force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I ask them urgently to recall the values on which the Burundian nation is founded - respect for life, tolerance and peace - to safeguard the nation's unity in this difficult moment,&quot; he said in the message. UNESCO, he noted, is engaged side by side with the Burundian people in the peace process. &quot;I renew this commitment once again and I express my complete solidarity with all those who ceaselessly work for national reconciliation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called on the international community to give Burundi all the help it needs to extricate itself from a dramatic impasse which threatens the stability of the entire Great Lakes region, adding that for its part, UNESCO is ready to support all such initiatives.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - The Organization of African Unity has warned against any attempt to overthrow the legitimate government in Burundi, saying it would impose sanctions on any regime that takes power by force in the troubled central African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The warning was issued Thursday, after an urgent meeting of ambassadors of the member-states of the OAU Central Organ on Conflict Management, summoned earlier by the OAU secretary-general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting considered the latest &quot;extremely dangerous and highly explosive&quot; situation in Burundi, where the president was on Wednesday reported to have taken refuge at the residence of the United States ambassador in Bujumbura.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any attempt to overthrow the legitimate government of President Sylvestre Ntibantuganya and to take over power through illegal means will not be accepted by Africa and will be strongly condemned and opposed by the OAU,&quot; a statement issued by the Central Organ said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It urged African countries and the international community &quot;to prepare themselves to isolate completely any regime taking over in Burundi by force or any other pretext.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In such an event, it added, African states and the international community should be prepared to impose sanctions against the regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement was read to the press by OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim said a meeting of the leaders of the the central African region would meet soon to decide on how to tackle the latest development in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere was undertaking &quot;urgent consultations&quot; with the leaders of the countries in the area on the date and &quot; widest possible attendance&quot; of the summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit will consider, among others things, the &quot;the speedy implementation&quot; of the decisions of the recent Arusha summit particularly on the provisions of &quot;security assistance to Burundi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this regard, the organ said &quot;the provision of such security to Burundi is needed now more than ever before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added that since the assistance had earlier been requested by the Burundi government, the alternative option would be a multinational force for humanitarian intervention, as recommended by the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim said the regional summit will send &quot;a clear and loud message of the intentions, firmness and cohesion of the countries in the area to all parties in Burundi about the situation in the their country and peace prospects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everything humanly possible has been done to avert tragedy in Burundi, but the political actors in the country refused to see reason,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, he added, the regional summit has to devise a means of containing the dangerous situation in order to save lives and create the necessary conditions for sanity to prevail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim said the issue was not how many troops regional countries can provide for deployment in Burundi, but rather the necessary finance and logistics &quot;on security assistance to Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said troops can be provided by Tanzania, Ethiopia and others, but would not elaborate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked to comment on the accusation of treason against Ntibantuganya by the opposition UPRONA party, when the president sought refuge in the residence of the U.S. ambassador in Bujumbura Wednesday, Salim said this was &quot;highly irresponsible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the president's party too can accuse UPRONA of high treason and of fomenting and creating tension that could degenerate into chaos in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ntibantuganya, a Hutu, took refuge in the residence of the U.S. envoy after his helicopter was pelted with stones when he tried to attend the funeral of 340 persons (Tutsis) massacred at a camp for displaced persons over the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even at this last hour the forces of sanity and reason could prevail in Burundi to avert further bloodshed and tragedy,&quot; Salim said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another development, the OAU chief immediately left for Abuja, to attend a peace conference of West African leaders on Liberia, opening in the Nigerian capital Friday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - The following is a joint communique from the Committee to Protect Journalists (New York) and Reporters Without Borders (Paris) issued July 26, 1996:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two international organizations that defend press freedom, the New York- based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and Paris-based Reporters Without Borders (RSF), today demanded the release of Chawki Amari, a cartoonist with the independent Algerian daily La Tribune, and called on the government to end legal proceedings against two of his colleagues from the paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial of Amari, Kheireddine Ameyar, La Tribune's publisher, and Baya Gacemi, the editor in chief, will begin on Monday, July 29. Amari was arrested at his home in Algiers on the morning of July 4. He is charged with desecrating a national emblem for drawing a cartoon, published on July 2, which depicted the Algerian flag in a satiric manner. If convicted of this offense, Amari could be sentenced to up to ten years in prison. On July 10, an examining magistrate denied Amari's request for bail. He is being held at Serkadji prison.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 3, La Tribune's offices were sealed and Ameyar and Gacemi were placed under judicial supervision and ordered to appear before the court twice a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Publishers of independent newspapers in Algeria yesterday denounced the detention of Amari and the suspension of La Tribune and called for an end to press censorship. Algerian journalists, who for three years have been the targets of an assassination campaign by extremists, held a one-day strike on July 15 to demand Amari's release and the reopening of La Tribune.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CPJ and RSF consider the imprisonment of Amari and the suspension of La Tribune to be grave violations of press freedom. And we believe that government censorship, which forces the press to print government propaganda as news, jeopardizes journalists who face a constant threat of assassination by terrorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CPJ and RSF join our Algerian colleagues in calling on the government of Algeria to demonstrate its commitment to freedom of the press by: -- immediately releasing Chawki Amari -- ending legal proceedings against Kheireddine Ameyar and Baya Gacemi -- lifting the suspension of La Tribune -- and ending government press censorship</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlanta - Zambia's flyweight boxer Boniface Mukuka on Tuesday pumped up Zambia's hopes for a boxing medal when he beat Mohamad Zbir of Morocco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mukuka, who joins bantamweight Dennis Zimba in the second round of the boxing preliminaries, outpointed Zbir 11-4 during the bout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidently inspired by Zimba, Mukuka looked sharp and crisp throughout the three rounds, using his jab with perfection. His style set the crowd and the reporters abuzz with excitement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to the apparent lack of coordination, Mukuka's next opponent in the 51 kg division was not immediately known.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other Zambian yet to fight, Davy Mwale, a silver medalist at the All African Games held in Zimbabwe last September, was expected to step into the ring yesterday while Zimba fights in the second round on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Olympic competition entered its fourth day on Tuesday, flyweight Eric Morel became the first US boxer to lose - to Cuban Maiko Romero - and also the first to embrace the great Olympic tradition of cashing in as quickly as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was courted by several boxing agents who wanted him to turn professional.  He agreed to sign some million-dollar contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the medals watch, Penny Heyns of South Africa and Danyon Loader of New Zealand both became double gold medalists. Loader added the 400 freestyle to his win in the 200 freestyle on Saturday night. And Heyns won the 200 breaststroke after taking the 100 breaststroke Sunday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The host nation, United States, also recorded history on Tuesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S.'s all-teen women gymnasts won the team gold medal for the first time in Olympic history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victory increased the number of medals won by the United States to 24 with Russia in the second place with 16 medals. South Africa, the only African country on the medals list has three medals, all coming in swimming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the tension builds up to the start of track and field events on Friday, Africa's biggest hope for double medals, Frankie Fredericks of Namibia announced that he will run both the 100 meters and 200 meters races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After planning to skip the Olympic 100 meters to focus on the 200, the Namibian has run so fast this year - the two best 100 times in the world - that he reluctantly decided to enter both sprints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fredericks, second in both events at the '92 Olympics, began the year figuring his best chance for a medal was in the 200. Then he ran the second- and third-fastest (9.86 and 9.87) times ever in the 100.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've run better 100s this year than I've run 200s,&quot; said Fredericks, who begins the 100m on Friday. &quot;So I think it would be stupid for me to run just the 200.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia and Commonwealth 400 meter-hurdles champion Samuel Matete, meanwhile, has been picked by 14 US newspapers and magazines as the favourite in the 400 hurdles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newspapers and magazines, including Sports Illustrated, picked Matete over American champion Bryan Bronson and Derrick Adkins for the event whose preliminaries begin on Monday. Matete is expected in Atlanta over the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in an interesting debut, Americans and former number one tennis players in the world, Monica Seles and Andre Agassi won their Olympic debuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seles, who was born in Yugoslavia but became a US citizen in 1994, beat Li Chen of China 6-0, 6-4. Agassi had a more difficult time, losing his serve twice in the first set before rallying to edge Swede Jonas Bjorkman 7-6 (8-6), 7-6 (7-5).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charlene Drew Jarvis and Emmily Walter of the Women Campaign Fund in Washington yesterday advised the Women's Lobby and other groups not to take on many women if they want to assist them to political office.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is important that women involve themselves in things where they are credible and can do better,&quot; Jarvis advised. &quot;These areas could be used to champion the cause of the women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia Civic Education Association's lawyer Christine Kunda and Zambia Democratic Congress vice-president, Susan Jere, the panelists in Lusaka, lamented the problems faced by women in climbing to political office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jere said women could only be at par with men in politics if affirmative action is introduced, a suggestion she said government had thrown out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walters said women had good chances to be elected to political office because they were generally regarded as honest people who do not get involved in scandals and other vices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And local government deputy minister Wendy Membe yesterday revealed that government was preparing an advancement of women strategic plan to the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officiating at the subregional meeting of the African Regional Co- ordinating Committee for the Integration of Women in Development at Lusaka's Mulungushi International Conference Centre, Membe said government would give equal opportunities to every one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government attaches great importance to the meeting in view of that fact that we are going to the general elections,&quot; Membe said. &quot;We are going to give equal opportunities to very one regardless of gender.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) is worried that Zambia's tight programme involving both the Africa Cup and World Cup qualifiers will have a terrible effect in getting foreign-based professional players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Association general secretary, Julio Chiluba, in an interview after a press brief on Tuesday, observed that it will prove difficult to get most players from their clubs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will surely have some problems in getting some foreign-based players because our games are too tight. We have some Africa Cup matches closer to World Cup games, in such situations, you cannot rule out difficulties,&quot; said Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 6, Zambia plays Mozambique in an Africa Cup qualifying match at Lusaka's Independence Stadium before taking on Congo in a World Cup Group C tie on November 10, in an away match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team returns to action on January 12 with aWorld Cup match against South Africa, before playing neighbouring Malawi two weeks later in Lilongwe in an Africa Cup of Nations qualifier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The FAZ executive committee will meet with the coaching staff to see how we can solve the problem, it's an urgent issue that needs a lot of attention,&quot; Chiluba assured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elijah Litana, the Saudi Arabian-based star defender has in the past proved difficult to get as his club rarely allows him freedom to move an inch outside the oil-rich Kingdom. Zambia's other outside-based players include celebrated skipper, Kalusha Bwalya playing his club football in Mexico, his brother Joel playing in Belgium, and Jonstone Bwalya who features in Switzerland.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Ruling MMD national secretary, minister without portfolio Michael Sata, has given conditional approval of the Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) president Dean Mung'omba's willingness to compromise over chairmanship of the inter-party talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sata, in an interview yesterday, said Mung'omba's statement was &quot;very welcome&quot; but he should formalise it in writing that his party had accepted President Chiluba as chairman.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Dean should write that he will accept President Chiluba as chairman,&quot; Sata said. &quot;Each party should write to indicate that they are willing to accept the President to chair the talks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sata said other parties should emulate Mung'omba who had shown maturity in the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a good development, I think we are getting somewhere,&quot; Sata said. &quot; Mung'omba's stand can only come from a mature politician.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sata insisted that only the President Chiluba could give the opposition the answers they needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the moment we are in the saddle and we have the answers and not a neutral chairman,&quot; Sata said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mung'omba in an interview on Tuesday said parties should be flexible in their approach to the talks to ensure progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is in the best interests of the country for us to run away from rigid positions,&quot; Mung'omba said. &quot;If the chairmanship is a rigid position it should be considered from both our side and that of the ruling party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And victory ministries leader, Pastor Nevers Mumba, said in an interview yesterday that he was making his own efforts to get the government and opposition to a round table but it was too soon to elaborate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The church is trying to get both the opposition and government to relax the conditions they are placing on each other before they seat,&quot; Mumba said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Egyptian ambassador to Zambia Khaled Osman has appealed for peace in Zambia during the run-up to the presidential and general elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Osman made the appeal in an interview at his residence in Lusaka yesterday, during a reception to commemorate the 44th anniversary of the Egyptian Revolution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope Zambia will pass through the elections in peace because we as Egypt stand for development of the whole Africa,&quot; Ambassador Osman said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Osman said Egypt was enjoying warm relations with Zambia which he said were evidenced through existing programmes of technical cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The cooperation between Zambia and Egypt is the bridge of solidarity between the two countries,&quot; Ambassador Osman said. &quot;Last year mutual trade increased though not to a satisfactory level.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the same function, mines minister Keli Walubita, said Egypt and Zambia enjoyed cordial relations in many fields of technical cooperation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Chinese Embassy in Lusaka yesterday said China cannot fill the aid gap left by the Western donors and it would be wrong for anyone to imply otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to counsellor of the embassy, Chen Zhanfu, China has been giving aid to Zambia for many years but it is nowhere near the levels donated by the Western governments mainly Britain and the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;China as a developing country also needs investment badly from other nations and that is why we are developing an open policy towards other countries,&quot; counsellor Chen Zhanfu said in an interview in Lusaka yesterday. &quot; The little aid we give to Zambia has become even smaller because China has adjusted its foreign aid policy to include private enterprise.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counsellor Chen Zhanfu revealed that the Chinese government would now like to encourage private businesses to link up with other companies in the developing countries as a way of fostering development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The $18 million which was given to Mulungushi Textiles last month as a soft loan springs from an agreement between Zambia and China to rescue the mills which were built through Chinese aid in 1984,&quot; counsellor Chen Zhanfu said. &quot;The $3.5 million dollars grant aid is for a project to be decided on between the two governments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counsellor Chen Zhanfu pointed out that altogether, the $21.5 per cent Chinese aid given this year falls far short of the almost $700 million in Western aid which Zambia formerly received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Therefore it is impossible that we can cover this gap,&quot;counsellor Chen Zhanfu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mulungushi Textiles aid programme will be carried out with the help of Chindo Textiles in China's Shandong Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Zambia Democratic Congress deputy secretary general, Azwell Banda, criticised statements made by the Chinese government that there were no political strings attached to the aid saying this was a fallacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, counsellor Chen Zhanfu insisted that the aid was based purely on project lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not interested in balance of payments support since we only have capacity for project aid,&quot; counsellor Chen Zhanfu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banda said he regretted the impression created by the state media that China was ready to fill the USA and UK aid gap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The way the granting of this aid was reported was very bad as it was blown out of all proportion making it appear as though it was manna to fill the gaps left by the Western countries,&quot; Banda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And chief government spokesman, information minister Amusaa Mwanamwambwa, concurred with counsellor Chen Zhanfu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zambia recognises the Chinese government's aid conditions and is grateful for the support,&quot; Mwanamwambwa said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The program offers the background on the current crisis featuring reports on, and interviews with, key players including: Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka, Hafsat Abiola, the daughter of Nigeria's imprisoned Presidential election victor Moshood Abiola, Innocent Chukwume, an official with Nigeria's Civil Liberties Organization,South Africa's Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and US human rights activists Randall Robinson of TransAfrica, Gay McDougall of the Int'l Human Rights Law Group, Kakuna Kerina of the Committee to Protect Journalists, Gerald LeMelle of Amnesty International and Mike Fleshman of the Africa Fund.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front(EPRDF) yesterday called on the nation to coordinate efforts to realise self- sufficiency in food through the implementation of the five-year development programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement the general council of the front issued at the end of its second general meeting held on July 21, the council said the implementation of agricultural extension programme nation-wide over the past year has resulted in commendable increase in production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EPRDF vowed to do all it can to realise its plan to increase production ten-fold this production year, the statement said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capacity building efforts both at the central and regional levels are under way for the successful implementation of the extension package in particular and the programme as a whole, it said adding that important achievements have been made in this regard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tangible measures have been taken through concerted effort of the central and regional governments to build capacities of leaders who could play a key role in expediting rural development at zonal and woreda levels, the statement added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added that capacity building training will continue with much vigour to maintain what has been gained so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement said regional governments have also realised the importance of an made efforts to involve the people and regional development associations in the implementation of the extension package. &quot;In this regard, roads, dams and soil and water conservation works carried out in the different regions are clear testimonies.&quot; it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regional development and aid organizations have made a promising start in raising funds from both local and foreign sources for the alleviation of social and economic problems in the regions, the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due attention would be given to translating into practice the mechanisms employed to enhance public involvement in development activities besides promoting the role of associations in all the regions beginning next year, it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The central government in line with the top priority it gave to the expansion of infrastructures has secured over 1.1 billion dollars in loans and aid to asphalt the highways, the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Development and expansion of infrastructure would help facilitate the improvement of the living conditions of the people besides creating favourable conditions for investors interested to involve in the industrial and agricultural sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council expressed readiness to promote encouraging, favourable conditions in regions next year to enhance participation of investors in regional states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council meeting devoted to assessing its performance throughout the year in the political and economic spheres noted in its statement that it has extended various supports to political parties and administrations where the front has no organized existence by forging relations on the basis of mutual respect and cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EPRDF general council commended activities carried out in implementing the programme as satisfactory but underlined the need for serious measures to curb the corruption and embezzlement witnessed at various levels of government structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It called on the Ethiopian peoples to staunchly fight against all forms of corruption so as to pave the way for prosperity and sustainable development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The front vowed to exploit all resources at its disposal to implementing the five-year development plan and urged the public at large to carry on with vigour its involvement in development activities to achieve its goals.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - Burundi's continued slide into anarchy was again a focus of the African media this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They warned that the tiny, yet highly volatile, central African state, where a coup took place Thursday, was at the tether and could soon plunge into massive ethnic violence -- the kind that hit neighboring Rwanda in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi's former Tutsi President Pierre Buyoya was proclaimed the new head of state Thursday by the Tutsi-dominated army, replacing Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, a Hutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ntibantunganya, 40, had been President since September 1994. He was jeered and pelted with stones by some Tutsi earlier Tuesday while at the burial of over 300 Tutsi civilians killed in the Gitega massacre. He later fled to the U.S. ambassador's residence in Bujumbura where he and his wife sought refuge.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A return to order was, however, still possible -- if Africa took decisive action on Burundi, said the African media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Day after day, Africa's image emblazons the television screens across the globe. Sadly, it is an image of the dead and the dying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Lately, the continent's visage is epitomised by the genocide in Burundi, where the Hutu and Tutsi mutilate each other in an orgy of deep-rooted hatred comparable only to that in neighboring Rwanda,&quot; the government-owned Times of Zambia said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even before the shame of meaningless mayhem in Rwanda that left a barren country populated more by the sight of death than life is over, another case of mass extermination brews in neighboring Burundi,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Africa's response to the crisis in Burundi has been fickle, the paper added. And unless this changed, hopes for any peace would be lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said the Organization of African Unity's plans for an on-the-spot assessment of the crisis this weekend was a step in the right direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to dispatch the mission was reached by the Central Organ of the OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution at a meeting in Arusha, Tanzania, June 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi's neighboring states at the summit decided to send in a regional force to restore order and help set the ground for peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Times said it hoped the force, vehemently opposed by radical quarters in the Tutsi minority, would be deployed soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;History has shown how little effect words alone have on factions resigned to eliminating each other,&quot; the Times said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Floundering over Burundi will reflect the desperate inadequacies Africa is said to host, that cause it to fail to come to terms with its own existence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ugandan press was near unanimous in urging global support for former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere's efforts to bring peace to the central African state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At times it seems Nyerere is fighting a hopeless battle,&quot; the state-owned New Vision said in an editorial. It was however essential that the entire international community, especially Burundi's neighbors, threw their lot behind Nyerere's peace initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The alternative is too horrible to contemplate,&quot; the paper said in an editorial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said the massacre of some 300 Tutsi in the Gitega region last week showed Burundi's ethnic extremism had reached unprecedented heights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Vision said it was clear the killings had been carried out by Hutus of the National Council for the Defence of Democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said the killings were in the cycle of violence that has hit the central African states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last year they (Tutsi-dominated army) backed the ethnic (Hutu) cleansing of the Bujumbura suburbs. For the last month Tutsi militias have been undergoing military training in Bujumbura. Backed by ex-president Bagaza, they are demanding incorporation into the army,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a chilling echo of the genocide in Rwanda, they are arming themselves with clubs stubbed with nails. Gradually the scale of killings and massacres on both sides have escalated... Burundi is poised on the brink of the precipice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Vision added: &quot;The extremists on both sides have taken over Burundi and are preparing to fight to the death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper said there was, however, still hope for peace. &quot;It is not too late to build bridges because there are still moderate Tutsi and Hutus who would prefer accommodation and compromise to all-out war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It urged Burundi's neighbors to honor plans for a force to restore order to the troubled country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in Dakar, Senegal, the state-owned Le Soleiel said Burundi had stumbled beyond the edge, and a return to order was now unlikely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The scenario for a terrible tragedy has been completed and an explosion can hit at any time,&quot; the daily said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said order had broken down with the flight of president Ntibantunganya into the American ambassador's residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another troubled spot which attracted the media is Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As leaders of the 16-nation Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) begin a summit Friday in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, they are expected to discuss how Liberia can return to the path of peace after more than six years of factional fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to the desperate humanitarian situation in that nation, West African leaders took the initiative of dispatching a peace-keeping force in 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But more than six years and 35 different agreements later, the situation is yet to normalise,&quot; the semi-official Daily Times, published in Lagos, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially, the problem had to do with the fact that members of ECOWAS were working at cross-purposes with some actively sabotaging the peace process through their collaboration with one or more of the faction leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the situation now appears to have changed,&quot; the paper noted, &quot;peace still eludes Liberia precisely because the various warlords find that, curiously, war can be a profitable venture&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the recent upsurge of fighting in Monrovia, the paper welcomed the suggestion that ECOMOG, the sub-regional force, be empowered to assume a more robust posture (more soldiers, plus amoured personnel carriers and helicopter gunships) so that it will be in a position to overwhelm any or all the warlords put together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is what is happening in the former Yugoslavia where, 60,000 heavily armed troops are poised to take on any party in the Balkan conflict which chooses to take on the peacemakers&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadly, however, the Daily Times pointed out that the economies of the countries reeling under the weight of sundry problems, cannot support such an expensive venture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It expressed the hope that at their summit, the leaders will once again renew their appeal to the international community, particularly the United States and the European Union, to provide ECOMOG with all the logistics it sorely needs to be able to carry out the task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit, the paper stressed, must make it clear to the warlords that patience is running out and they must shape up. &quot;It must be declared to them in no uncertain terms that should they continue to prove to be obstacles to peace, they will have only themselves to blame.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIAMI, United States (PANA) - Nigeria Friday advanced to the quarter-finals of the centennial Olympiad soccer event despite losing 0-1 to world champions Brazil in the last game of the &quot;Group D&quot; preliminaries in Miami, United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though Brazil, Nigeria and Japan (which beat Hungary 3-2 the same day) all ended up with six points each, Nigeria sailed through on goal difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria will meet Mexico in Birmingham in a quarter-final match on Sunday while Brazil takes on Africa's other surviving team, Ghana, in Miami. Mexico and Ghana advanced from group &quot;C&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other quarter-finalists are Argentina, France, Portugal, and Spain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until the outcome of the Japan-Hungary was known, Nigeria was not sure if it was heading home or to Birmingham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ronaldinho had put Nigeria's qualification in doubt with a 30th-minute goal, scored even as he complained of an infraction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goal was the crowning of a relentless onslaught by the Brazilians, which forced Nigeria's goalkeeper Joseph Dosu to make a series of incredible saves to ensure a respectable scoreline for his side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five minutes before Ronaldinho's goal, Dosu pulled up three of his best saves as the Nigerian defence line wilted under pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian &quot;dream team&quot; came into the match in the second half after coach Jo Bonfrere made substitutions to give more bite to its attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team squandered its best chance to tie the game in the 73rd, when Daniel Amokachi got a quick pass from Tijani Babangida at close range.  Instead of ramming the ball home, he ran into Brazilian Goalie Dida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking after the match, Bonfrere said he was satisfied with his team's play and the outcome of the match. He said the loss might very well be a wake- up call for his players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo told reporters he was impressed with the level of play of the Nigerian &quot;dream team&quot; and Africa's other representative, Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zagallo said it would be tough for his players if they had to meet Nigeria again in the semi-final.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overwhelming majority of the 56,000 people who watched the match cheered Brazil.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA)--The intra-regional trade among members of the Common Market for East and Southern Africa (Comesa) is being hampered by lack of adequate information on trade prospects, an official of the International Trade Centre said in Lusaka Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a one-day Comesa business promotion seminar, Jason Spencer- Cooke said that because of insufficient information Comesa states imported some 16 billion US dollars-worth of goods annually from outside the region, while only one billion dollars worth of business was generated from trade within the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spencer-Cooke, who is an advisor at the Geneva-based ITC, said this was as &quot; a result of lack of information on the availability of goods in the region and importation requirements by individual countries within Comesa.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seminar, attended by Zambian entrepreneurs, is the first in a series planned by Comesa for members of national chambers of commerce in all the member-states of Comesa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spencer-Cooke said that the Comesa sub-region and Africa as a whole needed to seize the present economic &quot;enabling environment&quot; to break onto the world market or risk lagging behind and continue to be marginalized in international trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quoting expert estimates, he said Africa could record a three-billion dollars trade deficit by early the next century despite the preferential access to world markets being accorded to the continent and other developing regions under the Lome conventions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The (trade) opportunities are there and these projections could be proved wrong provided businessmen on the continent took up the challenge and effectively compete for the world market by providing the needed goods,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comesa Secretary-General Bingu wa Mutharika, who officially opened the seminar, also challenged entrepreneurs in Comesa to be innovative and ensure quality products, so as to make an impact on both the local and international markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lusaka-based Comesa secretariat operates a computerized trade information network (Tinet) to assist member-states identify markets and products within the region as a way of helping to boost intra-regional trade.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwe, which next year hosts the convention on international trade in endangered species, is attracting support for its campaign to be allowed to resume trade in ivory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of the Zimbabwe National Conservation Trust, Boyman Mancama, said Friday that if the elephant population continued to grow it would not only endanger the elephants themselves, but would also be a danger to the environment in which they lived.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged non-governmental organizations to support the Zimbabwe government in its fight for the resumption of trade in ivory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trade was stopped in 1989 following the listing of elephants in Appendix I of CITES, which banned all trade in ivory and elephant skins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe and a few other Southern African countries want elephants removed from Appendix I to Appendix II, which allows regulated trade in ivory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe has a growing population of elephants of about 65,000, some 35,000 more than the recommended carrying capacity of its wildlife areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mancama said Zimbabwe's wildlife management policy has been acclaimed to be among the best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was this excellent management effort that had given rise to the vast elephant population growth, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Normally good managers get rewarded for their achievements, not punished as is now the case,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is expected that Zimbabwe will use the meeting of the 1997 CITES in Harare to campaign for the resumption of ivory exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western environmentalists fear that a proposal to downgrade elephants could lead to massive slaughter by poachers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABUJA, Nigeria (PANA) - A ministerial meeting of the Economic Community of West African states (ECOWAS) opened here amidst suggestions that heavy sanctions be imposed on Liberia's warlords.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting, of a nine-nation ECOWAS committee on Liberia, is being held ahead of the summit of heads of state and government of the community, which begins Friday in the Nigerian federal capital. In his opening speech, Executive Secretary of ECOWAS Edouard Benjamin urged the ministers to consider &quot;obtaining the support of the United Nations Security Council for the adoption of a resolution imposing heavy sanctions on the (Liberian) faction leaders.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A similar proposal was made by African leaders at the summit of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), held in Yaounde, Cameroon early this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The sanctions should cover the creation of an international tribunal before which they (faction leaders) can be summoned to answer for their crimes, should they persist in spreading terror and desolation in their country,&quot; Benjamin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin said ECOWAS members and the international community were becoming frustrated by the seemingly endless Liberian peace negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said although peace had returned to Monrovia, the Liberian capital, it was anybody's guess how long &quot;this lull&quot; would last because all the factions are reluctant to observe a total ceasefire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are all being circumspect and their distrust of one another is such that hostilities could break out at any moment,&quot; he warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin called for the beefing up of the ECOWAS peace keeping force, ECOMOG, &quot;by increasing its numbers, strengthening its logistics and providing it with adequate funds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The peace force sent to Liberia in August 1990, is estimated to be 10,500 troops-strong, with Nigeria's contingent accounting for about 75 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of the ministerial committee, Ghana's Foreign Minister Obed Asamoah also spoke in support of sanctions against the Liberian faction leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said this could include freezing of the assests of the warlords in member states, expulsion of members of their families and their collaborators from members states and requesting the United Nations Security Council to impose visa restrictions on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana, the current chairman of the 16-nation economic community, has hosted several meetings on the Liberian peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asamoah said despite the frustration being felt by the international community, ECOWAS should not abandon Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called for the review of the Abuja accord, saying it was &quot;running behind schedule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The review, Asamoah said, should take into account plans for election to be agreed by ECOWAS, the Liberian Council of State, the OAU, the U.N. and other international organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Elections (should) be targeted to take place by the end of 1996 or soon thereafter, after which an end point would be set to end ECOMOG's involvement in Liberia,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the committee earlier, Nigeria's Foreign Minister, Tom Ikimi spoke of the need to review the time-table of the Abuja peace plan on Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He rejected calls for election before disarmament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nine-nation committee is made up of Ghana, Benin, Togo, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, the Gambia, Senegal and Nigeria.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The South African government strongly condemns the increasing senseless violence in Burundi and wishes to make it clear that it will under no circumstances recognise any change of government in that country brought about through force,&quot; foreign minister Alfred Nzo said of the new development in the tiny central African country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi's former president, Sylvester Ntibatunganya, a Hutu, was forced to flee into the United States embassy compound in Bujumbura on Wednesday after he was stoned by angry Tutsis, as he arrived for the mass funeral of over 300 people massacred by suspected Hutu rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nzo said the South African government supports the efforts of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) to deploy a peackeeping force in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thursday's coup was also condemned by the OAU Secretary General, Salim Ahmed Salim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the continental body would not recognise the new leader who was defeated in the 1993 elections that brought an end to the previous military administration in the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - Burundi woke up under a military administration Friday, headed by Maj. Pierre Buyoya, who initiated that country's pluralistic experiment with the mid- 1993 multiparty parliamentary and presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He took over from President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, who has taken refuge in the residence of the American ambassador in Bujumbura.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement Thursday, Burundian Defense Minister Firmin Sinzoyiheba, justified the army's action to &quot;the socio-political disorder in which the country has been plunged, the inability of the country's institutions to deal with this catastrophic situation, the de facto resignation of the President of the Republic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also cited the fact that unspeakable acts of genocide and killings almost everywhere in the country &quot;have become commonplace, the inability of political parties to deal with the crisis in a coherent manner, and the proven inefficiency of the government convention.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buyoya, a retired Tutsi army officer who lost in the July 1993 polls, has been returned to power by the army, which is dominated by his minority ethnic group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That army has repulsed attempts by the international community to effectively mediate in the conflict which erupted in Burundi after the Oct.  21, 1993 assassination of the Hutu President, Melchior Ndadaye, who defeated Buyoya in July the same year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the advise of OAU after the takeover, South Africa, a major African power, stated Friday that it would not recognise the new Tutsi- dominated military administration in Bujumbura.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations, the European Community and United States government have also condemned the military takeover in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers of the Burundi situation believe the military takeover in Bujumbura was a move to pre-empt the intended sending of a regional force to prevent a possible genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, according to Oxfam, the international community needs to act fast otherwise a double genocide is likely with both the Tutsi-dominated army and Hutu rebels committing widespread abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oxfam called upon western governments to back vigorously the peace plan brokered by the former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere and accepted by the Burundian and regional governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It welcomed the Norwegian government's aid of 500,000 U.S dollars to Nyerere's peace initiative and appealed to the British government and other governments to match Norway's forthright action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, without strong international involvement, the world might again be compelled to stand by and watch the shadow of Rwanda pass over Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rwanda and Bosnia have tragically shown that only swift decisive action can save lives. How many bodies have to be counted before the world takes action?, said David Bryer, Director of Oxfam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charity organization called for urgent actions to stop &quot;the frantic amassing of weapons of all kinds by each group&quot; and stop armed incursions from neighboring states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said, however, that Burundi's crisis will not be solved by short term action and will require a comprehensive economic rehabilitation package to alleviate the effects of poverty which have done so much to inflame the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of these warnings and condemnation, however, swift action from the international community is unlikely due to the lack of interest towards the age-long Burundi ethnic crisis in general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if the Clinton administration had said Wednesday that Howard Wolpe, his special envoy would return to the region over the weekend and offered logistical backing for the proposed regional force, the fait accompli in Bujumbura might be difficult to reverse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S government, probably due to its past experience in Somalia, has categorically stated its troops would not take part in the proposed security assistance to Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports monitored here quoted an American government spokesman as saying Washington &quot;is not prepared to contribute troops to any kind of UN operation in Burundi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A State Department spokesman only said &quot;someone in the international system or one group of countries or one country will have to stand up and lead this operation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said &quot;there are countries in Africa well placed to do this,&quot; adding: &quot;It may also be that there are some European countries who could lead this kind of operation, countries that have an historic influence and role to play in the region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1994, the international community, including the big powers showed similar hesitations to intervene in Rwanda. The result was the massacre of between 500,000 and one million people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - As the South African government continues to finalise its mandate for negotiations with the European Union on a free trade agreement (FTA), the ramifications of such a deal are becoming more complicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African National Congress MP and trade expert Rob Davies told the Mail &amp; Guardian this week that more evidence was emerging of how much South African Customs Union (Sacu) states could be affected if the FTA, as presently envisaged, went ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Namibian Economic Policy Research Unit, for example, was &quot; gravely concerned about the impact of the FTA on revenue in Namibia&quot; after doing an impact study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They found that a reduction of a substantial part of tariffs to zero, as distinct from a reduction in tariffs, would be bound to affect the overall revenue pool of customs duties and that Namibia could lose anything up to 15 to 20% of total government revenue if this is not addressed,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EU had indicated it was not prepared to provide Namibia or other Sacu states with any compensation for this, but had suggested South Africa should find another way to fill the gap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They say that we need to understand that a customs union based on revenue derived from protectionism may not be sustainable in a globalising world,&quot; Davies said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Perhaps what should happen is that the customs union should base itself on some revenue source other than customs duties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just what that alternative could be has been left vague, but value-added tax has been mentioned, which is bound to create an outcry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What's true for Namibia is obviously true for the other countries,&quot; Davies said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Swaziland is now being urged to cut its budget deficit, and for Lesotho the size of the customs revenue is larger than for any other country. This is a highly significant and important issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He welcomed the fact that some neighbouring countries had started to identify their own interests, especially since they were all members of the Lome Convention and there was speculation that the FTA was increasingly being seen as a possible model for relations with developing countries when the current Lome agreement expired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from the loss of customs duty revenue, an FTA-type of arrangement would limit the access of Sacu states to the EU, while at the same time exposing them to competition from highly subsidised EU exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite growing impatience by the EU, South Africa is insisting on drawing up its negotiating mandate and having it approved by all interested parties, including parliament, before it starts negotiations with the EU. Davies said Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin had indicated that negotiations could possibly start in September or October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The EU has been complaining that we are taking our time, but I think that for us to go into negotiations without an anchored mandate could be a huge mistake,&quot; Davies said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have got an anchored mandate, which has gone through processes and been approved, and points to a clear position for member countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, some observers have hinted that the EU mandate was the product of a very tight set of compromises in Europe, and South Africa should not imagine it could shift the agreement very far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole history of EU negotiations is that 90% of the negotiations take place in Europe and only a fraction takes place with the other parties,&quot; Davies said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a sweetener, EU officials were saying that by anchoring itself to Europe, South Africa would be making its liberalisation programme credible and attractive to investors, no matter what the consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The extent of the liberalisation that we want to make credible should surely be our choice rather than somebody else's. The point that also needs to be raised is, investment to serve what market?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investments could serve the domestic, regional or European markets. An FTA of the kind envisaged by the EU would impose huge adjustments on companies presently serving the domestic and regional markets and this, in turn, would inhibit investors from entering South Africa. Any comparative advantage that South African firms had would be wiped out.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Private developers look set to be next in line for criticism over slow housing delivery. So far, the government and the banks have borne the brunt of most of the attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report by the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS), the focus of a housing workshop in Johannesburg next week, recommends that the government policy shift away from &quot;developer-driven&quot; housing delivery towards a more &quot;people- centred housing delivery process&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study, conducted by senior research consultant Mary Tomlinson, contradicts many beliefs held by state policy-makers and others by stating:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l Contrary to popular opinion, people are dissatisfied, not because they do not get the conventional &quot;four-roomed&quot; house; rather they feel they are not able to obtain maximum value for their R15 000 state subsidies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l Given a choice, people would have preferred to have purchased their own building materials with, say, a housing voucher, to build.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l Developers have failed to &quot;negotiate proper&quot; social compacts with communities, contradicting the general view that negotiations have been held up by talks with &quot;unrepresentative leaders&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the most startling findings of the study is that most beneficiaries have never heard of &quot;social compacts&quot; -- a key requirement of the government housing subsidy scheme designed to ensure community participation in housing projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Therefore problems do not lie with a needless insistence on involving beneficiaries in decisions, but with a failure to follow this approach vigorously enough,&quot; says the study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpumalanga Provincial Housing Board chairman Saths Moodley told the Mail &amp; Guardian that if four of the top developers awarded the bulk of the housing projects in the province had been on target, &quot;we could be showing a higher delivery rate&quot;. Mpumalanga leads all the other provinces with the fastest delivery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the developers, the New Housing Company (Newco) had to deliver more than 8 000 houses and has managed only 2 204 to date. Significantly, 1 906 of these houses fall within the R15 000 subsidy limit and therefore go to people who cannot afford housing credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deon Sutherland, Newco director responsible for Mpumalanga, admitted that the rate of delivery has been slow, but &quot;was confident that his company will be able to deliver more houses now&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sutherland warned that delivery delays pushed up costs owing to materials and interest hikes on holding costs. He estimated interest on holding costs for Newco Mpumalanga at about R1,8-million a year. Material costs were rising at the rate of one percentage point a month and electricals at 16% annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These hikes are ultimately paid by the beneficiary; otherwise, the overall value of what can be built for the R15 000 subsidy is reduced, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sutherland pointed out that the social compact concept served a useful purpose during the apartheid era -- to ensure housing delivery was not a top- down process and that it was legitimate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many social compact processes now delay delivery because some people use them as platforms to pursue other agendas, he charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Social compacts need change from being dominated by &quot;community representatives&quot; to being forums for the beneficiaries. He said the recently elected local authorities served the roles of community representatives adequately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mawela said: &quot;Social compacts do not work well in all areas. There are also administrative problems such as delays in conveyancing and deeds registration, as well as the different prices developers have to pay to obtain land, which influence the ultimate product that can be delivered and also at which time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mawela was emphatic that private developers were essential to the housing process. &quot;Just imagine what would happen if people just took money from the government to do their own thing. How would you ensure that the money really gets used for housing?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In the next five years, the effect of strikes in the clothing industry will be minimal as the clothing sector will have collapsed.  South Africa will be forced to embrace imports, argues Econometrix economist Tony Twine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twine says the economy, while in a transitional phase, will not benefit from a strike in the already declining sector. However, neither will management or workers benefit from such a strike, he says. Twine cites the example of the motor industry strike two years ago. Workers' demand for a wage increase was met by employers after nearly six weeks of striking, but workers were then forced to waive any claims for further increases for the next two years, until production caught up again.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twine adds that while there is sympathy for industries that are declining owing to holes in the customs net, the move towards lowering import tariffs will benefit the economy in future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Peter Cragg, executive director of the Cape Clothing Manufacturers' Association, an employers' body, says the industry can &quot;definitely be saved&quot; by, among other things, developing competitive goods for niche markets and containing input costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twine's view, he says, is clinical and certainly not a model of encouragement for manufacturers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strike, argues Cragg, is about containing input costs. &quot;This is not just the union asking for a marginal increase, it's about a total cost perspective, which means consumers will feel the pinch and they are the ones who will ultimately decide the industry's future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jabu Ncgobo, general secretary of the South African Clothing and Textile Workers Union (Sactwu), says he is aware of problems in the industry, but meeting workers' demands for a 10% increase will not bring it to its knees. &quot; It is going downhill owing to a number of factors, including the lowering of tariffs and the skipping of customs and import duties. Our demands will not cause the industry to collapse any further.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strike by Sactwu has allowed employers to exercise their right to lock- out and has generated support among employers for &quot;selective and partial&quot; lock-out action, intended to bring pressure on strikers, while not prejudicing workers who refuse to support the strike.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A leading member of the South African Communist Party has called on the government to take tough action to stop the &quot;investment strike&quot; by the private sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African National Congress MP and SACP central executive committee member Philip Dexter told the Mail &amp; Guardian that business seemed intent on pitting members of the ANC-SACP-Cosatu alliance against each other in a bid to break it so that it could play a dominant role in shaping economic policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dexter said this was &quot;extremely irresponsible and unpatriotic&quot;. It was sending a message to foreign investors that &quot;we are not a nation of winners, but people who can't agree on anything&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes a crunch point is coming. Domestic and foreign capital are not investing &quot;and if they do they are investing in a manner that is short-term, speculative, get-your-money-out-quickly&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For this reason, the SACP remains opposed to the lifting of remaining exchange controls because it could lead to capital flight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SACP criticism of the government's commitment to the gradual easing of exchange controls has led to speculation that the alliance is in danger of splitting, but Dexter denied this, adding that criticism and debate were healthy and normal in the alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the policy framework is a response to the kind of squeeze that the government is feeling at the moment. It was the best response in that it was the least worst choice. It is an attempt to keep sovereignty within our country and not undermine the agenda of the ANC-led alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, if we are honest, there are contradictions and those need to be resolved. There's going to be a bust-up and there is going to have to be some kind of showdown between business, labour and government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It requires the government being tough, saying to the unions, right, we agree that your wages are low and we are prepared to make a commitment, but you have got to make a commitment to productivity. Saying to business, if you don't invest in the areas that we identify, then we are going to penalise you, we are going to tax you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This could harm the economy, but the present lack of investment was equally damaging and &quot;one sometimes has to experience a little bit of pain to get better ... we have got to keep on reminding ourselves that this is not a normal economy, this is not a normal country and business in this country is not normal. It basically looks after the interests of a tiny white minority and until we break out of that and until we transform...we are going to have to go the hard route.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The government was this week keen to distance itself from the growing row over the Congress of South African Trade Unions' criticism of its growth and development strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not going to get embroiled in a debate through the media,&quot; said a representative for the Ministry of Finance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Finance Minister Trevor Manuel earlier reiterated that the parameters of the macro-economic framework &quot;were not negotiable&quot;, giving rise to speculation that the government was headed for a showdown with the unions and a consequent break-up of the ANC-SACP-Cosatu alliance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such claims were quickly denied by insiders. &quot;It was naive of Manuel to think</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he could get away with it without some sort of response from labour,&quot; said one. &quot;Now the unions have had time to consider the strategy, they are airing their concerns, rightly. But there is room for debate -- indeed, it is healthy and necessary. People are over-reacting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeremy Cronin of the South African Communist Party concurred: &quot;Within the alliance there is very strong support for ongoing debate on macro-economic policy. Manuel has not said he is ditching the reconstruction and development programme in favour of self-inflicted structural adjustment, so the alliance is not at risk. There is no major policy rift, just debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our concerns lie with the excessive fiscal constraints in the government's strategy; a policy of low inflation and high interest rates will squash growth. In addition, it is overly dependent on private-sector investment; we would like a greater public sector role with backing from the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'But the strategy has to be flexible, situations change constantly. Already, the Budget deficit is at 5,9% of gross domestic product, against a target of 4% for 1996-97. So one can't take a rigid approach. The reality is more fluid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a silly argument about nationalisation versus privatisation or fiscal restraint versus lassitude, but we are concerned that alternative models were not considered. There is no easy populist alternative; we understand the constraints. But equally, we need to steer a middle path.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosatu's Sam Shilowa echoed these concerns, but saved his most vehement criticism for the market. &quot;We are in danger ... of relinquishing our national sovereignty in the sphere of economic decision-making and sacrificing it on the altar of profits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem for the markets was not that Cosatu criticised the growth strategy -- &quot;they would, wouldn't they&quot; was the general assessment -- but that the government should not cave in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As long as the government stays firm and sticks to this course, investors will not be put off,&quot; says Dennis Dykes, chief economist of Nedcor. &quot;We've had very strong statements from the government in the past few months on policy, signalling its commitment, so people know where they stand. It's uncertainty that puts investors off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The logical forum for ongoing debate on economic issues is the National Economic Development and Labour Council. The government is due to present its plan next month, with a report-back from the three constituencies scheduled for February 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while Manuel is certain to stick to his guns on the parameters of the plan, the details are up for negotiation, leaving plenty of room for confrontation and controversy, says an insider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosatu may dig in its heels, although national strikes are not expected. &quot; At the end of the day, we'll deal with this in a typical South African way, and thrash it out until we eventually reach an understanding.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Mossgas market testing exercise revealed that one company suspects the sea-bed off Mossel Bay contained huge gas reserves, officials said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company, a United States exploration operation, expressed interest in buying the rights to the gas. If the deal went through, the company, which has asked to remain anonymous, would strike a deal with the government to supply Mossgas with gas for up to 20 years. It would then pipe the rest of the gas to the Western Cape, say officials keen on the idea. These same officials believe Mossgas should remain in state hands for the time being.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, an adviser linked to the process was wary of his colleagues' and the US company's enthusiasm. He pointed out that this same enthusiasm led former president PW Botha to build Mossgas to cater for much more gas than was proven by the US experts originally brought in to advise on the synthetic fuel project. That enthusiasm made the R12-billion plant one of apartheid's greatest white elephants, he said. &quot;Enthusiasm is not a substitute for exploration. Companies spend hundreds-of-millions exploring and then find nothing. In a way, these people have less to go on than even Botha.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Soekor official confirmed this scepticism, saying there was an enormous difference between proven gas reserves and possible gas reserves. He said all that was proven was enough gas to keep Mossgas going until 2005 -- and this would have to be linked up in two stages. Last week the government gave the green light to a R910-million project that will extend Mossgas's life until 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was also not convinced by the argument that Soekor had not found the gas in all the years it had been exploring the area because it had been concentrating on finding oil, as Mossgas, its only gas client, paid a cut price for gas.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In the week that President Nelson Mandela led a top-level delegation to Europe on a &quot;sell South Africa&quot; mission, the government turned down an offer by the Saudi royal family to buy Mossgas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just days after the government officially aborted the controversial sale of the synfuel plant, a representative of the Saudi king faxed through a R1- billion bid after being assured by South African officials the offer would be seriously considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the government did not invite Mossgas's royal suitors to catch the first plane from Riyadh to Mossel Bay and examine the plant. Instead, Minerals and Energy Affairs Minister Penuell Maduna replied -- after consulting with Mandela, who visited Saudi Arabia last year, and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki -- that the &quot;market testing&quot; process was over and the government was reconsidering its policy on Mossgas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This reaction implies an ambiguity on the government's part towards foreign investment: although the Saudi offer came in after the bidding process had been wound up, officials were aware the Saudi proposal was on its way before deciding to kill the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government team monitoring the sale -- comprising officials from the departments of mineral and energy affairs, finance, and trade and industry -- had also assured the Saudis the bid would be seriously considered. The team, which felt none of the other bids passed muster, decided the Saudi offer would not be affected by the termination of the sale process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood the Saudi offer was more generous than any of the others and motivated by the desire to have a strategic foothold in the South African market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One industry source commented: &quot;The repercussions of this will be felt for years in the international investment community. If this is how they (South Africa) treat the Saudi royal family, how are they going to treat lesser mortals?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Minerals and Energy Affairs director general Gert Venter said this week Maduna's reply should not be seen as a snub. Venter said Maduna had indicated to the Saudis that as the deadline for bids had passed, he could not give the nod without Cabinet's backing; that the government was reconsidering its position on Mossgas; that after consultation with Mbeki and Mandela, it had been decided the possibility of the Saudis acquiring Mossgas would have to be considered in the context of &quot;broader investment relations&quot; between the two countries. &quot;There is a lot the two countries can offer each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Venter told the Mail &amp; Guardian the Saudis had asked that the bid remain confidential and that Maduna was disappointed it had found its way into the public domain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government's fudged reply comes amid claims that its attempt to sell Mossgas -- or &quot;test the market&quot; --were half-hearted and beset with divisive politicking between those government factions committed to a sale and those against.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are some in the government who believe that -- at least for the moment -- Mossgas should remain in state hands as a synthetic fuel producer.  They argue Mossgas is an important foreign exchange earner -- it produces the equivalent of 40 000 barrels of oil a day. They add there are many benefits owed to Mossgas from the regulatory system governing the petrochemical sector which Mossgas has been cheated of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their plans for the operation include the possibility of finding more gas for the plant to prolong its life beyond 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many think otherwise. The International Energy Agency, a branch of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, said in a detailed report on South Africa's energy sector that the government should sell the plant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within the minefield of disinformation and squabbling among the officials involved with Mossgas lies the argument that former mineral and energy affairs minister Pik Botha and the Central Energy Fund, which owns Mossgas, hijacked the process by interpreting Cabinet's authorisation to &quot;test the market&quot; as a signal to try to sell the plant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some officials adhering to this school of thought say Botha could have found far cheaper ways to test the market. One British consultancy, Chem Systems, is understood to have offered to do a market testing survey for R500 000. The merchant banks and advisers cost the taxpayer R1,2-million a month for seven months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others argue that it is impossible to conduct an effective market testing without hiring a merchant bank and without being ready to sell. &quot;Only if you show a willingness to push it through are you going to get accurate reflections of what people are willing to pay.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from this, the problem with arguing that Botha hijacked the process is that both the trade and industry and finance ministries were intimately involved from the start. It is understood Botha consulted them at every stage.  &quot;(Trevor) Manuel and (Chris) Liebenberg had their hands on the rudder from the start. No matter what you think of Botha, he is a survivor. He is not the type to go it alone, especially when his party is a minority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those keen on bringing the private sector to Mossgas say the problem with their opponents' stance is it failed to take on board the government's disastrous track record with Mossgas -- which has bled the taxpayer R12- billion plus the R500-million odd a year in subsidies -- and that this alone should have persuaded the government to jump at the Saudi offer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlanta - The Olympic torch has become the symbol of the Games, but it is not the ancient symbol many imagine: it was introduced by the Nazis in 1936 because Adolf Hitler wanted to draw an association between the Nazi regime and ancient Greece. Somehow it has stuck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lit on Mount Olympus, the flame must not be extinguished and it flickers above the Olympic stadium throughout the Games.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Atlanta it has been used as a lucrative money-spinner, grossing the organisers an estimated $6-million. The flame has travelled a circuitous route across America after arriving there 84 days before the opening ceremony, carried in 800m stages by a small army of selected locals from Los Angeles over the Rocky Mountains and into Atlanta itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muhammad Ali, now 54 and riddled by Parkinson's Syndrome, brought a flood of conflicting emotions to the crowd when he made a surprise appearance to perform the final flame ceremony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the 83 100 people present were patently holding their breath as he stood and shook, gripping the Olympic flame like a small child wrestling with a rattle. But his eyes rage with fire still, and moving in tortuous contrast to the quicksilver smoothness of his fighting pomp, he brought the torch to the carrier that ascended a pylon to the flame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimately there was awed respect for a man whose inner strengthm is so profound that he can parade his shambling physical form in front of half the world, mingling with the fittest and strongest, the champions of today, knowing he is the spirit of survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One first for the torch this year is that the flame actually did go out on its travels, something that causes a certain amount of consternation and embarrassment in the Atlanta organisers' camp. Happily there was no need for a trip back to Mount Olympus -- two are always lit, though the reserve has never been used before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most embarrassed were the team at the Georgia Institute of Technology who had spent two years engineering the technology to keep it alight. They designed a torch that could withstand the heat, cold, wind and rain of a country such as the United States where the weather varies wildly from region to region. It is not only the Olympic gods who fuel the burning flame but a propylene fuel tank hidden in the Georgia pecan wood handle.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlanta - Sprinting isn't called an explosive event for nothing and personality clashes are rife in the 100m</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">T0 say that Donovan Bailey hates Linford Christie might be too strong.  Dislikes him, probably. Wants to dust him right off the track, without doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For proof, just look at his face, frozen on the finish line of the 100m in Nice recently, glancing scornfully away from his nemesis while he raises an index finger to the sky in victory. It is clear how much the victory meant to the Canadian.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speed thrills, and nothing thrills more than fast head-to-head competition.  But as we approach the Olympic 100m in Atlanta the rivalries between the men and women are becoming personal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps we should not be surprised. In this event vanity co-exists with vulnerability, strength with weakness. But almost everywhere you look these days bitter battles are being waged between the sprinters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The nearest thing to a world-class sprinter is a thoroughbred racehorse,&quot; said Frank Dick, Britain's former director of coaching. &quot;They have the same prickliness. They are highly tuned, on the edge. To call them showmen would be to risk trivialising what they do.&quot; In physical terms, they are pretty perfect specimens. In mental terms, they are remarkable. The hype surrounding a big race these days is like that surrounding a world heavyweight title fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the trash-talking men of the world-class sprints increasingly resemble boxers, with each race a claim for supremacy, each sprint a violent expenditure of energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The antipathy between Christie, the 1992 Olympic gold medallist, and Bailey, with Frankie Fredericks favourite to succeed him in Atlanta later this month, started in January when Bailey accused Christie of faking injury at last year's world championships in Gothenburg, where he took the title from the Briton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Christie was told what the man who once claimed him as his inspiration had said, he was reported to be furious, threatened to &quot;kick his butt&quot; all summer and even talked of legal action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like all sprinters it seems, Christie needs a focus for his anger. His two most common targets have been journalists and the North Americans, who he believes have never recognised the value of his achievements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1991, following defeat by world record holder Leroy Burrell in an indoor race at Cosford, Christie threatened to kill the American after a patronising glance at him mid-race, and an official had to step in to separate them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Occasionally, things go beyond an exchange of harsh words. Two years ago in Zurich, Dennis Mitchell of the United States repeatedly kicked Nigeria's Olapade Adeniken in the head while the latter was pinned to the floor of a hotel lobby by two other men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sprinters are very aggressive people,&quot; Christie says. &quot;Hurdlers, for example, can talk to each other; sprinters cannot. Hurdlers go against the barriers, but sprinters go against each other.&quot; Probably the most famous sprint rivalry in history was that between Carl Lewis and the man to whom he now refers as &quot;that other guy&quot; -- Ben Johnson. Lewis has admitted that the first thing he thought when Johnson beat him in the Seoul Olympics eight years ago was &quot;the bastard's done it again&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Johnson's subsequent bans for drug abuse have retrospectively devalued the confrontations in the late 1980s which had the athletics world in ferment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Johnson disappeared off the scene, Christie became Lewis's biggest rival. In today's new-fashioned version of old-fashioned rivalries, athletes like Christie and Lewis are stoked by the desire not just for prestige and power but for fat endorsement contracts and rich purses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Christie took on Lewis in the Dash for Cash at Gateshead three years ago, it earned each man z100 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women's 100m also currently has two leading protagonists who cannot stand the sight of each other. Indeed, few female sprinters would be bothered if they never saw Gwen Torrence again. After finishing fourth in the Barcelona Olympics, Torrence said she was sure three of the runners in the race had used drugs, by implication meaning these in front of her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was an angry confrontation in the village afterwards between gold medallist Gail Devers and Torrence. Torrence was branded a sore loser and forced to issue an apology by the United States Olympic Committee, though she has never retracted her statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merlene Ottey, one of these who felt slighted by Torrence's attack, got her revenge at the world championships last year when the American was disqualified after winning the 200m for running out of her lane, thereby robbing her of the sprint double. Ottey's view that Torrence had &quot;cheated&quot; poured more fuel on an already smouldering relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two do not speak to each other any more and Ottey has a clause in her contract with all grand prix meeting promoters which says she does not have to run if Torrence is in the race. It was a clause she activated in Stockholm recently when she refused to compete because her great rival was there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain's 1980 Olympic 100m champion Allan Wells directed his aggression not at one individual, but at American sprinters in general. Angered by their claims that Stanley Floyd would have won in Moscow had the United States not boycotted the Games, the Scotsman channelled his fury into beating Floyd at the first subsequent opportunity, in Koblenz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Americans ranked Floyd above Wells at the end of the season, on the grounds that he had a 2-1 record over him,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wells concentrated his efforts once again, fuelled by high-octane anger on a freezing night in Berlin, he beat the best of the American 200m sprinters by five clear yards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly all sprinters claim Jesse Owens as an idol but it is unlikely any of them will ever emulate the attitude he once showed towards a rival. It was shortly after he earned his four gold medals at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, when Owens was racing in Cologne against the man who had taken the 100m silver for the second time, Ralph Metcalfe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Owens led by two metres with 30m to go when he slowed deliberately to give his friend victory in one of the last races of his career. Metcalfe's winning time was 10.3; Owens, who finished in 10.4, realised almost immediately that he might have become the first man to run the distance in 10.1 had he not eased up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It did not worry him. &quot;Some things are more important than winning,&quot; Owens said when asked why he had done it. &quot;Competition is nothing without friendship.&quot; Whether Linford Christie, in retirement after this Olympic summer, Donovan Bailey or Dennis Mitchell will come to agree, is doubtful.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - To Freddy Nyathela, the road travelled by local black music technicians is less a road than an obstacle course. Founder and head of SARA (South African Roadies Association), a union established in 1992 for technical crews from disadvantaged communities, Nyathela has taken on the Ministry of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, the Standard Bank National Arts Festival organisers, music promoters, Sun International and international stars to develop training opportunities for technical crews in the industry. But he has had little joy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the 1994 ACTAG conference to determine our future arts and culture policy, Sara submitted a proposal to the ministry. Yet the recently released draft White Paper on Arts and Culture makes not even a cursory reference to music technicians, let alone their concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is all this talk about building art centres and promoting development,&quot; says Nyathela, &quot;but every cultural sector is heavily dependent on technology. It's time that the technical side was given its due, the importance of technical training in the arts acknowledged and treated as a priority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long before this year's Grahamstown Festival took place, Nyathela contacted the organisers asking for 10 Sara members to participate in the festivities.  But despite compliance with the organising committee's requirements, Sara's application was rejected. At the time, festival administration manager Harry Moss claimed that the sponsors had rejected Sara's application. Standard Bank denies this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And last month, Sara vented its frustrations on international tour promoters by toyi-toying outside the Standard Bank Arena during a performance by The Manhattans, after the promoters refused to allow Sara members to learn from the group's technical team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There appears to be a general reluctance to give learning opportunities to disadvantaged technical crews in South Africa,&quot; says Irish musician Keith Donalds, recently in South Africa &quot;on a fact-finding mission&quot; on behalf of the Agency for Personnel Services Overseas, which spearheads the struggle of roadies in Ireland. &quot;In Ireland colleges and training facilities have been established to equip roadies with technical knowledge. As a result, Dublin is becoming a centre of creativity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the pendulum might swing in Sara's favour. In July, Sun City's entertainment manager promised the union that Sun would provide four Sara members with accommodation, meals, transport and workshop opportunities, each time Sun City hosts an overseas act.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kigali - Burundi's beleaguered Hutu president, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, has sought refuge at the United States ambassador's residence in the capital, Bujumbura, and appears ready to relinquish office amid fears that he could become the third successive leader of his country to be assassinated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overwhelmingly Tutsi army denied this week that there had been a coup.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">But its ally, the mainly Tutsi Uprona party -- the second largest member in the coalition government and the real power in Burundi -- threatened to bring the administration down. Were Uprona to do so, the power vacuum would be an invitation for the military to step in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ntibantunganya fled to the US embassy after angry Tutsis pelted him with stones and cow-dung before a mass funeral for more than 300 people thought to have been massacred by Hutu rebels. The army stood by passively during the attack on the president, leaving his bodyguards to protect him as he fled to his helicopter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hutu rebel attacks and the military's reprisals have claimed about 150 000 lives in less than three years, almost all civilians. But tensions have risen as Tutsi extremists, including members of the army, have vigorously opposed a plan for a regional military force to intervene and protect civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An army spokesman, Lieutenant-Colonel Longin Minani, denied a coup was in the making. &quot;Our president and commander-in-chief is President Ntibantunganya.  There's nothing that has changed. If he has gone to the US embassy, we don't know why he went there. It astonishes us,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It's being called the Group Areas Act for immigrants.  Foreigners who acquire permanent residence status in the new South Africa will not be allowed to move home from one province to another for a year after their application is approved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor will they be able to change jobs without permission from the Home Affairs Department, and they will have to pay a fee of R360 to apply for such permission.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers for Human Rights (LHR) say that both these provisions of immigration law are unconstitutional because they contradict two rights in the bill of rights: the freedom of movement, and the right to engage freely in economic activity and to pursue a livelihood anywhere in the national territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although restriction of these rights is permitted, such restriction must itself be constitutional and, in our opinion, the present restriction by the Home Affairs Ministry is unconstitutional ... LHR is firmly of the belief that the Aliens Control Act is in any case out-dated,&quot; said Jeff Handmaker, an immigration specialist at LHR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home Affairs representative Hennie Meyer said this week that a permanent residence permit was approved on the condition that a foreigner had employment in South Africa, and a change of employment would mean the permit should be renegotiated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Potential immigrants and foreigners are being told that this and other tariffs are being charged to cover the administrative cost of processing applications. Sources in the Home Affairs department say the plan is to make the department financially self-sufficient, without burdening the South African tax-payer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British-born industrialist Peter Evans, who is battling to get permanent residence for his family, said from his home in Northern Province this week: &quot; It is impossible to make it here. Everything is against you ... hijackings, poor telephone networks and now Home Affairs. As soon as I make enough profit from my export business, we will be moving to southern Europe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evans is being charged R11 000 to get application forms for permanent residence for his family. He said the Home Affairs official in Pietersburg said that once the application was granted he would have to pay another unspecified fee. His wife has been waiting for two years to hear whether or not her application has been accepted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are asking for foreign investment, but making it very difficult for people to come in and invest,&quot; he said. Evans has been forwarding details of his struggle to the National Party, hoping they will take it up on a political level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meantime, Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, after prompting from cabinet, appealed again this week to foreign companies operating in South Africa to employ local South Africans above &quot;aliens&quot;, saying that such a move would demonstrate support for the Reconstruction and Development Programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buthelezi employs foreign-born Mario Ambrosini in his department as a constitutional adviser.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Opposition parties have begun flirting with each other in the post-election political lull, in an attempt to find common ground and sharper definition against the ANC, before the1999 ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while meetings between political parties lead to speculation of alliances, it is clear that opposition parties cannot form a consistent opposition bloc on the national level because they do not have common ambitions, their supporters do not like each other, and they do not command enough black votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most high-profile wooing this week was conducted by FW de Klerk who travelled as far out of his way as Ulundi to talk to Inkatha leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi about provincial power-sharing in the Kwazulu-Natal cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This meeting comes following a thaw in relations between Inkatha and the ANC, and it may be that De Klerk is trying to stop Buthelezi's drift to the ANC kraal, even if only publicly, and to remind him that they have a great deal in common: free market principles, family values, federalism and skeletons in the apartheid cupboard. The talks were driven too by the dynamics of Kwazulu-Natal where Inkatha has a slim majority and may need anti- ANC alliance partners to consolidate its power, if not now, definitely in the future.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Klerk's visit, as leader of the opposition in the national Parliament, is significant. It is consistent with the NP's stated desire to draw opposition groupings into its laager, and to form a brave new multi-racial movement which could challenge the ANC, if not beat it eventually at the polls. For this, De Klerk needs like-minded players and the black vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NP secretary general Roelf Meyer said this week that it was far too early to speculate along those lines, and that the party was merely looking at common interests at this point, not alliances. To counterweight the Inkatha visit, he said the NP would also be hoping to work more closely with the Democratic Party in future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would be natural for us and the DP to work together on economic policy, for example, where policies are so similar ... all parties in the opposition are talking at the moment and there is an understanding that there is a need to restructure opposition politics&quot; Meyer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political commentator Professor Robert Schrire of the University of Cape Town says that there will be no point to an alliance unless the parties can break into the ANC's electoral base together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a recognition that individually none of them can make any impact on that massive ANC majority and perhaps together they will be able to break in through a chink in the ANC's armour. The major reason why this will not work is the proportional representation (PR) system. With the PR system it does not make any difference if you have a common alliance or not because your support is reflected through numbers, not constituencies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Freedom Front's Pieter Mulder is similarly sceptical of an opposition alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you do not have over 50% you are in the minority. Whether you drown alone in two metres of water or all together in five metres of water it does not make a difference, the water is still over your head ... But in any case ganging up against the ANC will not work ... an alliance must coalesce around an issue, but there is no issue. Anti-ANC sentiment is not enough,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Freedom Front is using the recess to refine its political strategy. It has a go-it-alone approach, preferring to cultivate a relationship with the ANC on its own terms, rather than to get into the trenches with the rest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic Party at this stage is equivocal, searching for solutions for survival. DP Parliamentary spokesman Robert Desmarais, like members of the NP, believes that the political landscape needs to be restructured, but can't see it happening before the turn of the century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are hearing from our supporters that they are looking for a united opposition, but we don't think that the NP could be a vehicle to attract such a sort of opposition ... I think in the new set-up to prevent majority domination and to get a real opposition going would be to get control of a couple of provinces. If you have a united opposition controlling two provinces, then you can have a decent alliance,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be easier to form provincial alliances than national ones, because there is less at stake, and only an arm of the party is committed to a common cause, not its heart and soul. But many of the core DP supporters hate the NP with such vehemence that it is likely that the party would lose much of its own support by committing itself to an alliance with the Nats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephen Friedman of the Centre for Policy Studies believes that opposition parties would lose votes by getting into a huddle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unlike new democracies, South Africa has quite a stong political-party identification. Groups of people feel strongly about political parties and people are loyal to those parties,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even if the parties could talk their supporters around to an alliance, it's unlikely that their chorus will mean more than the sum of their solo voices. Schrire believes that the next real opposition lies within the ranks of the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A credible opposition party will only emerge when the ANC splits and part of that split forms the centre of a new alliance. And for that reason, the ANC is doing everything in its power to prevent that happening. The ANC maintains unity by maintaining a certain vagueness on controversial issues and follows a tough policy of not defining issues too sharply.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not for nothing that ANC upstarts such as Phatekile Holomisa, Deputy Minister of Environmental Affairs Bantu Holomisa and firebrand Winnie Madikizela-Mandela are kept within the fold at all costs, rather than be expelled to ferment opposition amongst black voters. When Deputy President Thabo Mbeki takes over from President Nelson Mandela, one of his great tests will be to keep intact the ANC's broad church. And if he does so, there will not be much point opposition parties getting into bed, because however hard they cling to each other, they will not be able to procreate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The world has learnt some sobering lessons about intervention in civil conflicts in the past few years. The United States experience in Somalia led to a consensus that it was foolhardy for an international power to intervene when the political groundwork had not been done beforehand. Peacekeeping could only work when the parties wanted a third- party intervention, when there were specific political-military goals to be achieved and when there was a firm time-frame on the intervention.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And South Africa has learnt its own particular lessons, particularly in relation to Nigeria. The first is the danger of getting the timing wrong -- acting when it's too late -- and of having inadequate intelligence. The second is the need to take a regional view and develop a consensus of affected African neighbours rather than acting alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African government has been wise to be cautious about rushing into African conflict situations. There is a justifiable nervousness about Pretoria reasserting itself as the bully of the continent. But there comes a time when the situation demands that the country overcome its collective queasiness and take firm and visible action. A threat of genocide in Burundi is such a case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not to suggest the crude response of simply sending in the troops.  The national defence force has yet to be confident enough of the successful integration of its forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it has, quite rightly, set out in its White Paper strict and quite cautious criteria for involvement in international peacekeeping operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, the South African response has been confused, with President Nelson Mandela ruling out South African involvement in peacekeeping, but Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad leaving the door open. We are becoming used to an occasional dissonance between the presidency and the Foreign Affairs Ministry, but the result is the kind of confusion and uncertainty which so bedevilled our response to the Nigerian situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps this is a time for the president to put the same energy into Africa as he has recently done in Europe, or for Deputy President Thabo Mbeki to shift his focus from Washington to the centre of our own continent. A visible and strong diplomatic intervention from South Africa is called for. This need not necessarily be directed at the warring parties, for that may at this point achieve little, but the Mandela/Mbeki team could do a round of African states in a bid to achieve a strong and coherent regional attempt to pre-empt disaster. It would also help lay the ground for any future, more direct intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a real and substantive role for Mandela's statesmanship in this situation, directing an active, constructive and visible South African diplomatic role.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obuasi, Ghana - Just beyond the yellow &quot;no trespassing&quot; sign, a burly fellow who calls himself &quot;Jangu-man&quot; stood ankle-deep in chemical-laced black muck. He scooped some into a wooden gutter with a dented old army helmet and washed it, letting promising particles gather into a porous brown cloth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quicksand-like pits have claimed the lives of at least five men working in the moonscape around the Obuasi gold fields this year, and security forces have killed three and arrested 17 others. But Jangu- man, whose name means &quot; wild one,&quot; displayed the confidence of a giddy gambler with nothing left to lose.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Working on the run-off from soil already processed with cyanide and arsenic at Ghana's leading industrial mine, Jangu-man is one of thousands of illegal gold miners who risk their lives to keep themselves fed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men gather around large-scale, licensed mining operations, living off what the big companies throw away or have not yet got to. Ghana's Ashanti Goldfields Company, is the world's 10th-biggest producer of gold, with its annual yield growing in the past decade from 200 ounces to nearly one million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ashanti's expertise is being sought by Mali, Niger, Guinea, Ivory Coast and others that have watched Ghana's status soar in international circles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But fears are mounting over growing tension between illegal miners and mining companies in Ghana, as unemployed youths become more desperate for a piece of the wealth being extracted from around their villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic reforms inspired by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have helped boost foreign investment here, but have also spurred resentment among locals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no doubt that gold mining is precipitating an increase in social tensions,&quot; a Western diplomat said. &quot;This is not a trickle-down type of prospecting ... You see some fancy cars around town, nice houses, but the lower 40% of the population is certainly no better off than they were a generation ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 1 000 illegal miners, known as galamsey, which means &quot;sell it quick&quot;, armed with blow guns, clubs and machetes, last month attacked Ashanti security men who tried to run them off a particularly rich site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The miners stole about 50 000 chickens from the company's poultry farm, ransacked buildings and injured three police officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whites, they are making all the money; the government must institute a law to employ the local inhabitants here,&quot; said Blay Marshall Wellington, a teacher in Tarkwa, near Obuasi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mining companies in Ghana pay high compensation to communities displaced by mining. But the funds often end up lining the pockets of local chiefs, not in those of the most needy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is only the galamsey that have saved the situation&quot; in many communities, &quot; said school principal EK Ayensu. &quot;And now the mining companies are asking them to move away from the concessions.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Sixteen years after Zimbabwe's independence, company chairmen may be black but chief executives are still mostly white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is so even in companies where the government has a majority share.  Skewed recruitment patterns which overlook local talent led the National Manpower Advisory Council last week to set up a taskforce to lay the groundwork for a clear policy on expatriate recruitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government is under increasing pressure, in a period of liberalisation and expansion, to allow companies to bring in skilled personnel.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blacks are climbing the corporate ladder, says Danny Dube, chief economist at the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe. But after years of command-economy certainties, they have little exposure to managing change in a rapidly evolving environment. &quot;It is a different context,&quot; Dube says. &quot;We are in a trial- and-error situation. Multi-nationals could be jittery about how new opportunities are exploited.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the absence of black faces at the top of multi- national companies operating in Zimbabwe is providing ammunition for President Robert Mugabe's attacks on white domination of the country's economy -- a problem underlined by the imminent arrival of an expatriate to head Zimbabwe's largest banking group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe recently took corporate giants Anglo American and Lonrho to task for preserving the lily-white complexion of their top management. He said correspondence he had seen from Anglo American indicated black empowerment in Zimbabwe was not a corporate priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Instead of appointing a black executive, they chose to appoint a white man from South Africa when in South Africa they are doing all in their power to include blacks as partners,&quot; the president told reporters in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe was thought to be referring to the arrival last year of Jonathan Oppenheimer (26), son of Anglo American deputy chairman Nicky Oppenheimer.  Although ostensibly a management trainee, Jonathan Oppenheimer has been attending board meetings of Anglo-owned companies and there is speculation he is being groomed to succeed current chief executive Roy Lander (60).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Kingdom-based Standard Chartered Bank is also currently in the firing line, for imposing a new chief executive on the Zimbabwe company.  Barry Hamilton will replace fellow Briton Jim McKenna, whose contract has expired after a turbulent tenure at the company's helm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Workers took to the streets last year when management raided a profit- sharing scheme to cover a bad debt. And a controversial Zim$20 charge on third-party cheques fuelled customer discontent with what were seen as opportunist imposts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamilton, who takes up his appointment on August 8, faces a fiery welcome from black empowerment lobbyists who have threatened to make his life a &quot; nightmare&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Indigenous Business Development Centre has described Hamilton's appointment as &quot;an affront to the people of Zimbabwe&quot; while the president of the Affirmative Action Group, Phillip Chiyangwa, has promised that the new chief executive &quot;will regret ever coming to Zimbabwe&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports suggest Standard Chartered has applied to the Immigration Department for permission to bring in a further 26 expatriates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a full-page advertisement this week, Standard Chartered stated that its chairman and five out of eight senior executives are black. But this doesn't impress Chiyangwa who refuses to believe there are no blacks capable of occupying the top job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One candidate for the post, Nkosana Moyo, announced his resignation from Standard Chartered last week. Although he declined to give reasons, it is thought he is dissatisfied with being sidelined to senior posts in London and Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A black board member of an Anglo-owned company offered another view. The company's chief executive would need to combine both technical skills and the right corporate image. Very few black corporate heads, he said, found time for school boards or charities and similar bodies. &quot;Their careers end at 5pm on Friday and resume at 8am on Monday,&quot; he said. &quot;The good all-rounder is hard to find.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More to the point, Anglo accords extensive managerial autonomy to its chief executives and there may be a reluctance to appoint individuals -- -black or white -- susceptible to importunities from ministers in Mugabe's government.  Critics say Mugabe is ignoring the company's contribution to training and development and pressing instead for the appointment of cronies who would complement the ruling party's elaborate patronage network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Anglo insiders say the company has built up a strong second tier of black managers from which a future chief executive may well be drawn.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Now that the politicians are talking peace and the police are collecting the weapons of war, KwaZulu-Natal's inyangas say it's time to mix a new muti to cleanse the warriors of the blood of their victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uhlambo (peace medicine) is set to replace intelezi (war medicine) as the most popular product on the traditional-medicine market if a new initiative aimed at drawing the province's estimated 4 000 inyangas, or traditional healers, into the peace process is successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 50 leading inyangas from across the province met provincial peace workers last week in an effort to put an end to the &quot;misuse&quot; of intelezi by battle- bent warriors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KwaZulu-Natal Peace Committee director Dennis Nkosi said the initiative was the culmination of a series of local meetings launched after &quot;people on the ground told us the inyangas are the only people who can stop the violence.  The inyangas are the custodians of the traditions and ethics of their communities, so they have an important role to play in solving the problem of violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most inyangas who attended last week's meeting were adamant that &quot;a real inyanga is a respected person who gives medicine to heal the people, not to kill&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem is that people use our medicine in a wrong way. Even the snakeskins (once given to children to cast off bad spirits and make them obedient) are now used to kill. There must be good directions and the inyangas must be well-trained,&quot; argued Elphias Mhlongo, an inyanga from Eshowe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others blamed charlatans for &quot;selling killing medicine when they are not even inyangas&quot;. Said Samuel Blose, the South Coast president of the National Inyangas Association: &quot;People who sell killing medicine should not be called inyangas, they should be independent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some argued that traditional cleansing ceremonies and the slaughtering of animals, known as ihlambo, need to be revived to appease the ancestors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkosi said the fact that these healing ceremonies, which form part of the inyanga's traditional role, are rarely being performed has contributed to the cycle of violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the election of a committee of inyanga representatives to work with the peace committee marked the beginning of a &quot;long process&quot;. The committee agreed that the next step would be to enlist the help of amakhosi (chiefs) and izinduna zezinsinzwa (heads of the warriors) around the province in bringing together the perpetrators of violence to be cleansed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the precise formula of the peace muti, its price and the potential patients still have to be identified, the inyangas' appreciation at being brought in &quot;from the wilderness&quot; to which previous peace efforts have relegated them -- together with a new understanding of the economics of peace -- appear to have encouraged them to commit themselves to the peace path.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Sbongisile Dlamini from Port Shepstone pointed out: &quot;The killing of the people is the end of our jobs. We get money from curing people, but if they die we get nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The first thing the Inkatha Freedom Party will have to do when its national conference opens in Ulundi this Friday is try to solve the vicious power struggles within its own ranks. The frequent internecine battles have shattered the party's public image and diminished its hopes of becoming a potent political force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent fiefdom-building exercises of the party's prodigal MP Thomas Shabalala may have left the most visible dents in its image during last month's local government elections, but they were by no means an anomaly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Party sources say National Council meetings are frequently dominated by the kind of back-stabbing confrontations which have spawned a series of divisions along racial, ideological and geographic lines, but these appear more often than not to be rooted in personal advantage.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent National Council meeting apparently ran into second innings when hardline constitutional negotiator Walter Felgate launched an &quot;ugly&quot; 10-hour bid to wrest control of the party's finances from secretary general Ziba Jiyane. The move was described as symptomatic of much deeper problems between the two leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Felgate's bid failed, it is not the first time the leadership has come to proverbial blows over control of the R260 000 parliamentary allowances paid to the IFP's 87 MPs each month. KwaZulu-Natal MP Arthur Konigkramer -- the man Felgate argued should relieve Jiyane of his financial responsibilities -- earlier fell out with Jiyane after arguing that as treasurer general he should decide how party resources are spent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, Felgate and Konig-kramer tussled last year over the provincial constitution, but they have now joined forces in a bid to cut Jiyane's purse strings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three men operate from separate offices in Durban: Jiyane from the party's office in the city centre; Felgate from an IFP consitutional subcommittee's office in an upmarket suburb; and Konigkramer from dusty Umgeni Road. At one stage there was speculation that Konigkramer was trying to shut down Jiyane's offices, and Felgate has reportedly been asked by Jiyane to justify the expenditure on his office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some IFP leaders argue that &quot;there can only be one bull in the kraal&quot;, others say this perspective is a relic of the party's autocratic past; that all organisations have power struggles, and the trick is to manage them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resolution of these struggles will inevitably lead to the second major task facing the IFP: democratisation and modernisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jiyane launched a major bid to &quot;deepen democracy&quot; at last year's national conference. He was promptly shot down by Premier Frank Mdlalose, who argued that the IFP has always been democratic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Party officials say little has changed since then, and time is running out: if the IFP fails to transform by 1997, it will be hard-pressed to make significant gains in the 1999 elections, and could even face significant desertions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A significant obstacle to reform lies in the ongoing power play.  Correctional Services Minister Sipo Mzimela's election as the IFP's deputy national chairman last year -- a post not mentioned by the party's constitution -- created enormous confusion about the chain of command in the party's highest echelons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jiyane's efforts to make MPs accountable to the grassroots membership have met resistance, particularly from those leaders with no popular base whose power derives exclusively from the patronage of IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some party leaders blame Buthelezi's own style of operation: power and influence continue to vest in him, resulting in various factions constantly vying for his approval. The leaders argue that the deep entrenchment of this style within the party makes it almost impossible for it to change under his leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers say this dilemma is not unique to the IFP: PW Botha negotiated with Nelson Mandela, but only FW de Klerk was capable of taking the National Party into the new era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IFP's national conference will have to project a new image, not only for the party, but also for the provincial government it leads. KwaZulu- Natal's local government election results demonstrated that rallies and branch launches -- both of which inevitably trigger violence -- can at best hold on to existing support, but only delivery can build new support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delivery requires competent, efficient and accountable ministers, and the party will be under pressure to undertake a major provincial cabinet reshuffle to achieve this. At least one empty seat has to be filled, but the IFP will also have to oust some of its deadbeats -- and this will require breaking with its tradition of eternal power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Retaining traditionalists like Welfare MEC Prince Gideon Zulu and Public Works MEC Celani Mtetwa -- both of whom face possible hit-squad charges -- does the party's image no good. They are unable to relate to modern political institutions, and are inaccessible to the public, the legislature and standing committees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Arts and Culture Minister Ben Ngubane's imminent return to the province is a positive step. He is seen as an efficient, accessible minister who fits into a modern democracy. One question being asked in IFP circles, however, is whether this is a demotion for Ngubane because of his proximity to the ANC nationally, or whether Buthelezi has asked Mdlalose to step down as premier to allow Ngubane to take the reins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Either way, Mdlalose's position is untenable. He is not only premier but also Safety and Security MEC. He is overstretched, with correspondence from his office sometimes reaching legislature standing committees way after deadline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other national leaders are also expected to return to the province, but it is unclear whether this will happen now. If the IFP only replaces Finance MEC Senzele Mlhungu with Ngubane and waits for the provincial constitution to pave the way for more posts, it could be a long wait.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speculation in IFP circles is that at least two national leaders -- particularly those with strong grassroots bases, such as senators Phillip Powell and Senzo Mfayla -- could return to bolster the provincial legislature.  Other names mooted include Felgate, Narend Singh and Musa Zondi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only after these issues are dealt with can the IFP seriously begin deliberations on possible alliances. Party leaders say there is unlikely to be a big-bang announcement on this and, for the time being, the party is content to play the field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a party counting its recent election losses, the IFP is in a strong position, with both the ANC and NP wooing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buthelezi's comments after Tuesday's meeting with NP leader De Klerk suggest he sees no contradiction in co-operating with the ANC in the national and local governments and co-operating with the NP provincially. He has nothing to lose and will want to gain as much as possible from both his suitors: the NP can help him extract greater provincial powers from the ANC, while the ANC can offer him a national profile -- some say even a deputy presidency -- and a foothold in the key urban centres of KwaZulu-Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As long as they both continue to woo him, he will get the best deal possible. Only when push comes to shove is the party likely to take a clear stand.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A Namibian zinc mine is the focus of an acrimonious billion- rand battle between the daughter of a German Jew who fled the Nazis to prospect in Africa and steel giant Iscor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mose Kahan on his deathbed in 1964 took on Iscor as a partner in his beloved mine, it was his way, his daughter claims, of giving southern Africa a share in the mine he called Rosh Pinah (Hebrew for &quot;headstone&quot;) -- the headstone of the Namibian economy. In those days Iscor, now a flourishing private company, was state-owned and South Africa controlled Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was a fateful decision which laid the ground for an epic struggle between his daughter and Iscor over ownership of Rosh Pinah that entered its latest round in the Namibian High Court last week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kahan's diminutive, wily daughter, Diane Lidchi, is pressing ahead with a N$1-billion claim against Iscor after four years of legal wrangling which has seen Moly Copper, (the company she heads which holds her father's stake in the mine) lose all its links with Rosh Pinah. The mine now stands to end up in Australian hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ek gaan vrek (I am going to die)&quot;, was how, according to Lidchi, her father started his conversation with Iscor's then-head of mining, Ben Alberts, 32 years ago. The deal, says Lidchi, involved Iscor receiving 51% of the mine for R510 and a commitment to manage and fund it in good faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The partnership worked for 23 years, but turned sour after Iscor was privatised in 1989. The Rosh Pinah holding company, which Iscor controlled, increased its loan account dramatically. When the loan account with several creditors including Iscor hit R46- million in 1992, Iscor, which was obliged to pay Moly Copper 9% of the mine's royalties, said it would stop funding the mine and pushed for its liquidation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iscor has since publicly said the high payout to Moly Copper was the main reason for its decision to wind up its joint venture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lidchi fought Iscor every step of the way and argued it had deliberately framed the mine's accounts to make it appear unprofitable -- a charge Iscor vigorously denied. She says the current head of Iscor's mining division she is up against is Alberts' son, Ben.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lidchi argued Iscor, after privatisation, wanted to ditch its joint-venture partner, and the only way it could do this was to find a way of liquidating the mine's holding company and then buy it back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To some extent, she found an ally in Nambian Judge TJ Frank. Although he ruled in Iscor's favour in the Namibian High Court in June 1994 and ordered the mine be liquidated after sifting through both sides' arguments, he did not award Iscor costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Frank said: &quot;While it may be a fact of life that big fish eat small fish, this does not mean that I should make the process for the big fish even more palatable by awarding it a further prize (costs) for being such a successful predator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The predetermined and calculated way in which Iscor acted by sending out letters to creditors so as to preempt the liquidation suggests the strategy averred to by Moly Copper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Lidchi lost her appeal, the Rosh Pinah holding company was put on the chopping block and Iscor did, in fact, buy up the assets for sale -- for N$35- million. This included N$12-million which remained from the liquidated Rosh Pinah holding company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lidchi said Iscor's decision to buy it back was in complete contradiction to its position in court, where it had argued the mine had no future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few months later Iscor suffered a reversal of fortune when it found itself sitting on the mine without the right to mine. In a bizarre twist, the government decided to give the mining rights, which had been suspended on liquidation, to an unknown mining company, P&amp;E Minerals, linked to the ruling South West People's Organisation party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lidchi scoffed at the time: &quot;The Namibian state has no good reason to give it to the now-privatised Iscor, which has such an unpredictable attitude to profitability.&quot; Asked to comment on the decision, Namibia's Mines and Energy Minister Andimba Toivo Ya Toivo said: &quot;I have given the rights to P&amp;E Minerals and that is final.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iscor threatened to take the Namibian government to court for the decision, but then changed tactics and started talking to P&amp;E about a joint venture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was much speculation that Lidchi was behind P&amp;E which had Namibian Trade and Industry Minister Aaron Mushimba as one of its directors -- a suggestion she batted off at the time with a chuckle and a &quot;no comment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, last week, coinciding with the latest court round with Lidchi, Iscor announced it was intending to expand Rosh Pinah through a lucrative agreement with Australian mining company Western Metals. The deal, which still has to be approved by the government, gives Western all of Iscor's current Rosh Pinah holding company and Iscor N$151-million worth of shares in Western.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked why Iscor was now seeking to expand Rosh Pinah after pushing for its liquidation last year, spokesman Piet Combrink said: &quot;Rosh Pinah was liquidated as it was unable to pay its creditors of which Iscor was one, and Iscor was no longer prepared to fund the mine under the existing shareholder agreement.&quot; As far as the mineral rights go, Western will have to negotiate with P&amp;E, Iscor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lidchi has slotted this latest development into her affidavit to back her N$1-billion claim: &quot;I have on many occasions, including in past litigation involving Iscor, complained that Iscor has deliberately embarked on a programme to represent the mine as comparatively worthless in order to seek to acquire it for a ludicrously low price.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the Western deal she says: &quot;There has been no significant movement in zinc or lead prices over the time, and the mine is clearly worth at least this amount even at the time of the liquidation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Far from being put off by the Western Metals development, she is more belligerent than ever and is now steering her latest court case from her vast Africana-cluttered home near Johannesburg's Zoo Lake.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A coalition of environmental organisations will launch a supreme court challenge to force the Department of Trade and Industries (DTI) to divulge details about hazardous waste still coming into South Africa, despite repeated assurances from the government that it will ban all toxic imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month Green Party politicians in the Europe Union told the Environmental Justice Networking Forum (EJNF) -- a coalition of more than 180 labour, green and civic organisations -- that South Africa was conducting an ongoing trade in hazardous materials from other countries in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have been trying to communicate with the DTI to obtain details about what kinds of materials are coming into the country but have failed to obtain any response. Should they continue to be unco- operative and withhold information, we will go to court to enforce our rights under the new Constitution,&quot; EJNF co-ordinator Chris Albertyn said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EJNF and affiliates of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Coastu) this week staged a protest in Brits outside a United Nations workshop being held in the town for delegates from various African countries to discuss the Basle Convention, which imposes controls on the international toxic waste trade, and other issues relating to the handling of hazardous materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alliance of green organisations and trade unions accused the government of &quot;double-speak&quot; by stating it was opposed to the trade in industrial waste while, in fact, allowing hazardous materials to come into the country for processing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want the Cabinet to commit to an immediate ban on importation and exportation of toxic waste. Workers and the environment are being sacrificed for profit. The Thor Commission of Inquiry (set up to investigate how massive amounts of mercury waste imported into South Africa in the 1980s can now be disposed of) has uncovered corruption and incompetence in government and we cannot trust officials to tell the truth to the rest of Africa about our own situation,&quot; said Richard Worthington from the Johannesburg branch of Earthlife Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South Africa has a waste crisis and government is misrepresenting our capacity to handle even our own waste. Workers have died and groundwater has been poisoned at both Thor in KwaZulu-Natal and Vametco near Brits. There are 1 200 known waste dumps, of which 200 operate without any permit or government control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albertyn said his organisation was frustrated by lack of response from senior DTI officials to demands for full details about the kinds of waste coming into South Africa for treatment and processing at unknown plants in various parts of the country. &quot;We don't want to be unnecessarily confrontational but will escalate the challenge by going to the supreme court and arranging further protests around this matter unless we get the details we want from the department.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian has also struggled to obtain information about the ongoing hazardous waste trade despite repeated requests to officials in the office of Trade and Industry Minister Alec Irwin. More than two weeks after the paper asked for the details, the following response arrived from the DTI:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With regard to the importation of hazardous waste for recycling, your attention is drawn to the South African Revenue Services who collate South Africa's import data. Your inquiry will be greatly expedited if you could supply the HS Code (eight digits) of the goods with which you are concerned, or a reference from the descriptions in Annexes 1, 2 and 3 of the Basle Convention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albertyn said the court action would aim at breaking this kind of &quot; bureaucratic stranglehold&quot; on information about a trade that could have a serious impact on the country's environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry, this week denied South African negotiators were refusing to endorse clause 39 of the Lome Convention, which bans the movement of hazardous materials between Europe and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and is much tougher than the Basle Convention. &quot;South Africa is committed to sound environment policies. We are a signatory country to the Basle Convention, a multi-lateral agreement which involves numerous countries including member states of the European Union, which prohibits and regulates the international flow of hazardous and dangerous waste,&quot; said Mlambo-Ngcuka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South Africa is presently engaged in a series of broad complex negotiations with the EU, including negotiations on South Africa's access to the Lome Convention. The EU has insisted on &quot;linkages&quot; between various trade- related issues and consequently our position on Article 39 is part of ongoing negotiations which have not been finalised as yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Senior sources in the Western Cape ANC say a major shake-up is required if the party expects to challenge the National Party in 1999 for control of the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following their crushing defeat in urban local government elections in May, the ANC has begun admitting it has crippling weaknesses and little support among the biggest voting bloc in the province -- urban, working-class coloured people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its biennial conference in September offers an opportunity to rebuild the organisation. But it appears to have sparked a leadership tussle rather than a chance to produce a strategy to increase the party's popularity in the province.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An internal assessment after the election concluded ANC structures were weak, its political message does not grab voters and its leadership cannot whip the party into shape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some regional leaders blame the ANC's national leadership for the mess in which they find themselves. They complain there is little understanding among national leaders of the peculiarities of the region and far too much interference in decision-making, particularly about who should lead the Western Cape ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The rot set in way back in 1991 at our first conference when President Nelson Mandela virtually instructed us to vote for Allan Boesak as leader of the province. We weren't allowed to consider who was the best person for the job,&quot; said a member of the regional executive committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That leadership style is wrong, and it was proven when it didn't work. You can't pin all your hopes on a Messiah, you can't decide that because a person has a certain skin colour and religious background that he is the best person for the job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another executive committee member said he noticed during the run-up to the May elections that ANC leaders did not understand how national politics impacted on the Western Cape electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will be an ongoing project to get them to understand the unique aspects of this province. Nationally, voters may welcome redeployment of teachers and affirmative action in the workplace, but those messages have to be amended to find resonance here,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of our national leaders came to the Cape to address public meetings with quite crude and conservative viewpoints on coloured nationalism. It might have drawn a few laughs but it does nothing to help our cause to eliminate racism in the region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The race to find the right leadership for the job by September has completely overshadowed early preparations for the conference. The ANC's incumbent chair, Reverend Chris Nissen who won the position by default when Boesak stepped down, is not available for re-election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some, this creates the opportunity to elect a leader from the ranks of the ANC's power base in the Cape, its branches in African areas. For others, the race is on to find someone who will woo coloured voters, preferably an older statesman, fluent in Afrikaans and of sober, Christian habits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Possible candidates for the position of chairperson include Justice Minister Dullah Omar, national assembly MP Tony Yengeni and health and welfare MPL Ebrahim Rasool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The National Party has a white premier, Hernus Kriel, and a white leader in the province, Dawie de Villiers. That proves ethnicity is not an important factor for the electorate,&quot; said a senior ANC member who favours the election of an African leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Coloured voters are incredibly conservative and deeply racist. They really believe that their houses, jobs and schools are going to be taken away by the ANC and given to blacks. That's why we need leadership that can reassure them that the ANC is a party for them as well,&quot; was another viewpoint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there are those who believe what is required is a leadership team, who can be everything to all potential voters and reflects whatever programme of action is drafted by conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ANC has been extremely successful in putting a lid on the potential for racial polarisation in the ranks, but it is starting to break out,&quot; warned a senior Khayelitsha member. &quot;It hasn't been raised in meetings yet, but some of our members are starting to say that they've lost hope of coloureds ever supporting the ANC and the leadership should reflect its paid- up, committed members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This situation isn't helped by the caucuses, cliques and factions which always emerge on the eve of conference. There are already people going around the townships urging people to vote for them and pouring mud on the integrity of other possible leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These tussles must not be allowed to cloud the fundamental question at conference: what has the ANC done wrong up to now in the Western Cape and what should it do to win 1999?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The leadership squabbles should be properly managed so that it does not break out and destroy the little that is left of the ANC in the Cape. It has the potential to split the organisation in two.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - South African Airways' sponsorship of the Olympic team's trip to Atlanta cost about R25-million, the Mail &amp; Guardian has learned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAA spokesman Leon Els would not comment on the sum involved, but said the sponsorship money came from SAA's promotions budget and was part of a broader business plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAA has recently been rumoured to be in financial difficulty, having reported a loss of R100-million in the first quarter of 1996, and said to be down R42-million for the second quarter. Els claimed this was to be expected owing to the increase in the fuel price and a reduction in the number of South Africans travelling abroad, and did threaten the airline.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Controversy arose this week around SAA's gift of air tickets to Transport Minister Mac Maharaj and Public Enterprises Minister Stella Sigcau. Maharaj came under particular fire from the Democratic Party since his wife and two children accompanied him to the opening of the games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAA originally offered Maharaj two tickets to Atlanta, but provided an additional two tickets for his children when Maharaj asked for them. He said he did not get to spend enough time with his children, and had planned a family holiday before receiving the offer from SAA. He told the airline he would only take up the offer if his children could accompany him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Els said Maharaj and Sigcau had been invited because they are the ministers with whom SAA has the most dealings. This has given rise to suspicions the airline was trying to gain favour with the two ministers who are in a position to affect its future, Sigcau, since she is in charge of privatisating parastatals, and Maharaj since civil aviation is part of his portfolio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Els denied SAA had an ulterior motive in hosting the ministers. &quot;There's nothing sinister about this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maharaj does not believe he is close enough to SAA for his acceptance to create a conflict of interests. He argues that SAA, as national carrier, makes an input on any decision regarding route licencing, and he as minister may accept or reject the airline's suggestions. In any case, decisions on licensing air routes lies ultimately with the director general of transport, not the minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maharaj said his primary motivation for accepting the tickets was to support the South African Olympic team. But having been offered the tickets, he realised with Cape Town's Olympic bid coming up, it could be useful to use the opportunity to inspect Atlanta's public transport arrangements for the games, and discussed this with the director general who agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the ministers, SAA also hosted 36 &quot;corporate clients&quot; at the opening of the games, who Els says were representatives of companies which frequently flew with SAA.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The South African Broadcasting Corporation will not reveal how much it spent on sending 87 staffers to cover the Olympic Games in Atlanta -- amid accusations the quality of the coverage barely justifies sending an SABC team at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SABC's efforts have been roundly lambasted by sports journalists in South Africa. Chief among the criticisms is that SABC journalists attempt to comment on sports for which they are not qualified, while on the other hand the SABC switches over to foreign network commentary at moments when a homegrown South African perspective would be most valuable.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, the SABC relied on New Zealand's Channel Seven network to interview double gold medallist Penny Heyns. After the interview, Heyns was asked if there was anyone she would like to thank, and she thanked her family and friends back home. The interviewer added &quot;how about a thank you for Channel Seven&quot;, which Heyns conceded, whereupon viewers were taken back to the Topsport studio where anchor Nick Collis remarked bitterly: &quot;How about a big thank you to the Topsport team too?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's hockey match against Malaysia and South African boxer Victor Kunene's fight against Czech Pavol Polakovic were covered by Australian commentators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At other times, TV viewers have had to contend with South African commentators referring to boxers simply as &quot;the red one&quot; and &quot;the blue one&quot;, dropping such gems as &quot;the crowd comes from all over the world&quot;, or attempting to comment on lesser-known sports such as judo and showing themselves to be embarrassingly ill-informed about the finer points of the sport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was in addition to the minor glitches such as screening times in the small hours being changed at short notice, and footage of swimming appearing over the commentary on the South Africa-Australia hockey match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mail &amp; Guardian sports editor Christian Stephen said the SABC broadcast team was guilty of &quot;ill-prepared and inaccurate comments on sports they don't understand&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday Times sports editor Cherylin Ireton agreed: &quot;Some of the commentators didn't have the vaguest clue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African Sports Illustrated editor Matthew Pearce described the quality of the coverage as &quot;shocking&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 87-strong team sent to the games breaks down into 48 from Topsport, 15 Airtime staff, 11 from Television News and 12 from SABC Radio. The radio crew comprises two co-ordinators, two news staffers, one technician and nine commentators who among them handle all 11 official languages. In addition to the team of 87 were the commentators for Radio Metro and 5fm who received commercial sponsorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SABC liaison officer Marj Murray said she did not think the team was excessive given the task they had to perform. She said presenters had been chosen for their ability to do on-camera presentations, their competence at voice-overs on edited inserts, their aptitude for research, and their ability to do their own make-up for on-camera presentations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Post Office, the institution which once symbolised bureaucratic incompetence, could be converted into a rural bank which will stimulate a thriving small-farm economy in the countryside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lack of banking services in the platteland -- along with soaring levels of rural crime -- is fast becoming a major block to the government's land reform programme, according to a commission set up to look into financial services in the countryside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department of Land Affairs last year started a pilot land redistribution programme as the first phase of an ambitious policy aiming to redistribute 30% of all arable land before the turn of the century -- and to ensure that the new owners use it productively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But banks have been withdrawing from small rural towns at a rapid rate over the last few years and organisations involved in pilot schemes around the country say the lack of rural credit and basic banking services for a new class of black farmers is fast becoming a major obstacle to effective land reform.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now the commission established to investigate the ways in which efficient financial services can be supplied to rural areas has come up with the novel idea: the Post Office can be used to remedy the problem by providing basic banking services to small rural businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Commercial banks have a low level of outreach and service provision especially in poor rural areas, where people have to travel long distances to major towns for banking facilities,&quot; says a report of the commission released last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The transformation of the Post Office is potentially far-reaching. An expanded branch network will provide a vehicle for improved financial services to rural areas, in addition to its responsibility of providing a communication network and postal services ... Consideration should also be given to using post office savings accounts as a basis for providing emergency credit to poor people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report notes that very little of rural peoples' already meagre savings are retained in the rural areas of South Africa and are therefore not available to be invested in low-cost technologies, tools, livestock and other items needed for farms to grow. South Africa has the lowest savings rate among developing nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another problem is the high level of rural crime. The report notes that small mobile banks or cash pay-out companies which use armoured cars to travel from one town to another have been targeted by organised gangs. The result is that the cash vans, often shadowed by a helicopter, race into town and leave immediately after dispensing their payments. No extra banking services can be offered as a result of this way of operating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many small businesses in rural areas periodically need relatively small amounts of money for operating capital and other purposes. At present the fact that a family member is a pensioner may qualify them for some short-term loans, for example, access to a pension permits a credit line for tractor hire in some rural areas,&quot; the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the Post Office were to allow savings to qualify for leverage of short- term loans, this could be innovative in extending the modest lines of credit which people need ... The parastatal Post Office system offers the developmental state a very real possibility of using the available national infrastructural base to great advantage, helping to normalise rural life, after the disruption of forced removals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commissioner's team -- chaired by Helena Dolny, wife of former Housing Minister Joe Slovo -- suggests a task group be set up to investigate a range of proposals about how the Post Office can be transformed effectively into a rural development agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also recommends the Land Bank be restructured so that its current bias in favour of existing commercial farms be shifted into a support role for land-reform programmes and the financial needs of emerging black farmers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - South Africa's first legal dagga plot -- an experimental project near Rustenburg in the North West province -- has just completed pioneering research which could provide farmers with a lucrative new cash crop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tobacco and Cotton Research Institute (TCRI) recently produced a report on a two-year research project aimed at developing a biological model for industrial hemp. This plant cannot be used as a drug but will have massive value as an industrial crop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Cohen, coordinator of the programme, says his firm, the Southern African Hemp Company (SAHC), received permission from the Department of Health two years ago to import five strains of hemp from the Netherlands in order to test their adaptability to South African conditions. The research project was jointly conducted by SAHC and the TCRI.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first phase of the work has now been completed and the organisation is consulting with the Land and Agricultural Policy Centre in Johannesburg as well as the government's land and health ministries about the prospect of moving into a more extensive development phase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a very serious project that could allow South Africa to develop an industry based on a genetic resource that is well adapted to South African conditions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adds LAPC director David Cooper: &quot;This is valuable research which shows the many constructive uses that cannabis may have. If more research around its potential is developed this could have possible advantages for new emerging farmers who could easily grow it as a viable cash crop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plant could also be used by established commercial farmers to supplement existing activities. Countries all over the world are now using hemp to provide raw materials for thriving paper, clothing and building- material industries. The seeds of these plants are also capable of producing highly nutritional oils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAHC has completed a report on the potential for using strains of the type tested near Rustenburg for a range of industries in South Africa. The most useful applications for the local strains are in the pulp, paper, textile, food and construction industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hemp fibres are used to make good-quality paper and building materials used in roofing insulation and construction boards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strains under examination at ARC have a content of about 0,4% of tetra hydra cannabaloid (THC) while the powerful dagga plants used as a drug have a THC content of 6% to 10%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The great advantage of the plant is that it is well- suited to South Africa's climatic conditions and does not require heavy use of pesticides and fertilisers -- chemicals that have caused serious ecological damage in commercial farming regions of South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we can develop the non-intoxicating plant for industrial use here it would be a valuable example of how renewable plant resources can be used to promote development in a sustainable way,&quot; says Cohen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LAPC now plans to send results of the Rustenburg study to Land and Agriculture Minister Derek Hanekom so that various state agencies can begin discussing policy about the prospect of allowing a legitimate hemp industry in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some agricultural economists argue that dagga is already one of the country's biggest cash crops -- rivalling the sugar industry in terms of the amount of money it turns over annually and an activity that funnels money into poor households -- and that it would be easy for small farmers to switch to non- toxic and legal variants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cooper says one of the major problems to be addressed before any moves to legalise some strains of hemp is the possibility that non-toxic strains will be used as a cover for growing the real thing on rural farms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, with an effective regulatory system, hemp could become one of South Africa's most innovative ways of using the land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hemp strains are the basis of legal industries in China, India, England, France, Italy, Spain, Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, the Czech Republic, and numerous other states.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Lomati Valley, a fertile piece of subtropical bushveld that lies in the shadow of the Lebombo Mountains in Mpumalanga, has produced some of the hardiest of South Africa's pioneer farmers: men who moved into the malaria-ridden area on the Mozambican border in the 1930s and, with DDT pesticides to protect them, turned the land into some of the continent's most productive real estate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is why Piet de Wet, a tough entrepreneur who made his fortune as a beef baron in the Free State, came to the valley early this year. The self- made millionaire decided at retirement age that, instead of hanging up his khaki shorts and velskoene, he would break just one more piece of new ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only Inala Farms's pioneering men and women are very different, if not exactly opposite, to the kind of white men who came into the valley 60 years ago, took the land and used exploitative methods -- harsh even by South African standards at the time - -- to fill the valley with lush groves of mangoes, pawpaws, pineapples, bananas, tomatoes and endless rows of sugar cane.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is because Inala is a place where the farmworkers -- about 580 men and women who were issued eviction orders just eight months ago -- now own a majority share in a commercial estate worth more than R24-million and fast becoming the most productive real estate in a corner of the country where farmers are already renowned for producing subtropical fruits of the highest export quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a place where De Wet and his managers, a clan of khaki-clad boers and a former minister from the old KaNgwane government, have decided to stick by the new owners and make the farm dispel the legend that land reform in South Africa will inevitably result in rural decay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in the process these men have acquired a new zest for cultivating the land they love. &quot;Land reform will only work if there is a successful marriage between the aspirations of the landless and the motives of private enterprise with a conscience. Development has to be intertwined with real hard- core business for it to work,&quot; explains De Wet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A farm, you see, is not like a mine. You have a never-ending cycle of replacement, a responsibility to channel profit and resources back into nourishing its main resources which are the land, the water and its people.  When you do this the land talks to you. It says: 'You are gonna have to look after me otherwise I'm just going to leave you.' &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just two months after De Wet was appointed as Inala's chief executive officer, he has used this philosophy to turn the farms into a sub-tropical paradise where you can walk among the trees and pluck pawpaws and mangoes for lunch or visit the plantation where local police arrived two months ago to verify that a bunch of Dwarf Cavendish bananas weighed 77kg and could be entered in the Guinness Book of Records as one of the heaviest ever harvested in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New fields have been planted and export contracts are rolling in. Already performance is outstripping a business plan aimed at making a profit of R5- million by the end of next year. The company is already so buoyant that Inala plans to open an offshore company with Reserve Bank approval on Jersey Island that will be 40% owned by the farmworkers, to handle its international marketing and foreign-exchange earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is estimated that within 10 years Inala will be making a pre-tax profit of R30-million per annum. Already minimum wages have risen by some 250%. And there is, literally, a gold mine on the farm that may be worked in the near future by an association of small miners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight months ago the future of the Inala Farms looked very different. The old owners, a legendary pioneer family in the Lomati Valley called the Schoemans, ran up so many debts that the banks forced the farms into liquidation. A group of sugar- cane farmers from KwaZulu-Natal called the Crookes put in an offer for R16-million, but said they would only buy if the farm was cleaned of its workforce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The liquidators promptly issued eviction notices and, in November last year, the workers began singing struggle songs and doing the toyi toyi at the entrance to the farm. When the Crooke brothers arrived to inspect the estate, one of them was assaulted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You know the amazing thing is three of the old white managers stood with us at the protests,&quot; says Albert Sibiya, chairman of the workers' committee that represents the new shareholders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They didn't really toyi toyi but one of them, Danie Basson (who belonged to the army's special forces), had just been bitten on the foot by a snake.  He had a drip with medicine and was just waving this about to show his protest. I think it was a sign that they really love this place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workers threatened to burn the farm from one corner to the other if the sale went ahead and the Mpumalanga government was forced to intervene.  Premier Mathew Phosa contacted Land Minister Derek Hanekom who asked the Land and Agricultural Policy Centre (LAPC) to visit the area and come up with a solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LAPC, in turn, sent an enterprising consultant called Simon Forster to do a feasibility study on the idea that the workers could use household grants to buy the farm. Forster structured a package that involved each of the 600-odd farmhands putting each of their R15 000 grants into a R9-million kitty, and a consortium of private investors forking out another R7-million to buy the farms -- which were promptly given the name Inala by the workers, an isiSwati word that means &quot;Place of Great Harvest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Conditions were appalling at the time,&quot; says Forster. &quot;Some workers were earning R5 a day. There was no running water two of the three compounds and some of the children had kwashiorkor. There was no day-care centre for the babies so mothers had to wrap them up and take them into the fields during working hours. Some workers tell me that some of them died after being bitten by snakes in the cane fields.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forster ran the farm -- along with its remaining managers -- for a few weeks after it changed hands. He promptly took one of the old farm manager's houses and turned it into a day-care and community centre where milk is served for the babies. He put potable water into the compound and he built showers and toilets near the packing shed for men and women who had been forced for as long as they could remember to relieve themselves in the fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The estate was like a multi-engined aeroplane firing on all cylinders, but all out of sequence,&quot; says De Wet. &quot;It just needed someone to come in and tune and fly off with its people on board. I said to the workers when I got here, 'Look I can't do it without you. You could probably do it without me.  But just maybe we can all do it better together.' And I can tell you it's a real trip now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is it that drives people like De Wet to pioneer these new ways of using the land and South Africa? &quot;My motivations are two,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The one is that I don't have any problems with making money. The other is that it just gives me a thrill. You could say I have always supported the aim of our new government to improve the lives of these people. But I am not doing this for politics because there are only two organisations I really belong to -- the Dutch Reformed Church and the (nearby) Malelane Country Club.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Wet, who is fond of saying that the softest thing about him is his teeth, runs the farm with a rod of iron.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I kick arse when I have to and I tell the workers that if anything moves, you salute it. If it doesn't move, you paint it or keep it spotlessly clean.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is this the kind of thing the workers had in mind when they decided to buy into the farm? It is as though the question never even crossed Albert Sibiya's mind. &quot;We need him to be like that. If he wasn't the farm would go bankrupt and we would all lose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Down at the new community centre, the workers are now practising songs that are different to the ones they sang whenever the liquidators came to the farm last year. A local schoolteacher has been asked to compose a hymn that tells the story of this unique farm and a choir is practising nkosi Sikelele for the day when President Nelson Mandela comes to witness the way things are being done at Inala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in the evening, the white managers sometimes gather at their club on the banks of the Lomati River to have a braai and sing uncouth songs about rugby and women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At an event like this the farm manager, Johan Minnaar, explained why he was so dedicated to the experiment. &quot;It is because we want to turn history on its head,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forster, the mastermind of these strange happenings down in the Lomati Valley, adds: &quot;The experiment has already dismissed the popular notion that land reform simply involves giving marginal land to poor rural people so that they can simply have a secure place to stay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Inala is an example of how innovative ways of doing things can even produce more benefits than were originally intended by land reform policy makers to benefit people who have always worked the land.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Truth and Reconciliation Commission has been left in the lurch by those it needs most to solve the mysteries of the past -- human rights abusers -- and attorneys general are being blamed for their failure to show up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission this week said while about 1 800 people have applied for amnesty, 1 650 of them are prisoners -- known cases where convicts argue their crimes had a political dimension. Of the about 150 who are not prisoners, it appears no more than a few dozen involve &quot;fresh&quot; cases where no prosecutions have been instituted. Less than five months remain before the amnesty applications deadline of December 15.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Figures across the spectrum, from human rights lawyers and individual truth commission officials to representatives of the &quot;old guard&quot;, this week said the main reason perpetrators have failed to come forward is uneasiness that the possibility of self-exposure at the commission may damage their chances in courts of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the commission's &quot;proportionality test&quot; may well mean those guilty of more serious crimes will not get amnesty in spite of confessions, many are staying put, taking a gamble on not being caught.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some argue KwaZulu-Natal Attorney General Tim McNally's indictment last week of Dirk Coetzee and security police colleagues -- in spite of Coetzee and two of his co-accused having lodged amnesty applications -- has increased perpetrators' uneasiness about the truth process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human rights lawyer Brian Currin, who counts a number of perpetrators among his clients, said this week: &quot;This has become a major problem. I have even advised some people not to apply.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currin said while the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act ruled out the courts using confessions before the truth commission's amnesty committee as evidence, confessions may well alert attorneys general to the culprits in unsolved cases, who may then prosecute on the strength of their own investigations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dumisa Ntsebeza, acting commission chair while Archbishop Desmond Tutu was abroad this week, said the commission was not overly concerned about the low turn-out, as it was hoped there would be a change nearer to the December deadline. &quot;I don't think it is (a crisis) for the commission, but it is a crisis for the perpetrators. You know what human beings are like. There is the problem of a bottle neck, as we anticipate a mad rush closer to the cut- off date.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ntsebeza, who also heads the commission's investigative unit, said the commission and the attorneys general shared the desire for the pursuit of the truth, but that the different end result of both processes -- criminal justice seeking prosecution, and the commission encouraging amnesty applications to harness reconciliation -- caused &quot;tension&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the attorneys general have co-operated with the commission on many levels, but that there was no full agreement on which classes of investigations they should hand over to the commission. Though the commission had taken no decision yet, it would not &quot;waive any rights&quot; allowed it by the Act to subpoena witnesses, including attorneys general, to supply information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ntsebeza pointed to two instances of potential conflict with Jan D'Oliveira, Transvaal attorney general. D'Oliveira has made no secret that he regards the tentative approach to the commission by 22 former and serving security force operatives last month as an apparent attempt by some of them to pre- empt intended prosecutions -- and that he still wants to prosecute in the more serious cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ntsebeza said: &quot;We have asked for all the relevant information. (That means D'Oliveira) will not be able to prosecute in the medium term, but for us it is the wider picture ... A complete picture can only emerge if we have as much information as possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said the commission wanted to subpoena Joe Mamasela, the former Vlakplaas operative both McNally and D'Oliveira want to use as a state witness in exchange for indemnity. Said Ntsebeza: &quot;We have said we are not going to waive any of our rights, and we have in fact briefed legal counsel for an in camera hearing (with Mamasela).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some attorneys general are known to be reluctant to hand over cases and witnesses as they believe their prosecutions -- especially serious cases where amnesty may not be given by the commission -- will be prejudiced irrevocably if they are first exposed to the quasi-judicial procedures of the amnesty committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McNally confirmed he had met other attorneys general in Pretoria this week.  He would not say what the talks were about -- apart from discussion over media criticism of his handling of the Coetzee case. It is likely the talks included aspects surrounding the need for a co-ordinated approach where criminal prosecutions may have an impact on the workings of the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been argued that the threat of prosecution is the &quot;big stick&quot; which will supplement the &quot;carrot&quot; of the commission's amnesty offer in getting human rights perpetrators to confess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, Currin -- and Coetzee's lawyer, Julian Knight -- found themselves in bed this week with former police commissioner General Johan van der Merwe and the Foundation for Equality before the Law in attacking the approach of the attorneys general. The foundation, which has among its members top names from the apartheid security establishment, was established after McNally started his prosecution of former defence minister Magnus Malan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While no one argued prosecutions should not be instituted against those who failed to apply for amnesty or failed to make full confessions, they agreed the &quot;selective&quot; prosecutions at the moment created uncertainty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Currin: &quot;The attorneys general -- certainly McNally -- have been acting in an unpredictable way ... What we need is legislation that all (political) prosecutions are suspended pending the (finalisation of the) commission.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Merwe said: &quot;You take a big risk if you ask for amnesty now, and then you are charged. After that you can hardly excercise your normal rights in terms of the Criminal Procedure Act ... to exercise (your) right of silence, or to plead not guilty, or to wait and see the evidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knight said: &quot;What the attorneys general are doing in deciding to selectively prosecute people is having the effect of putting people off from coming forward -- which is protecting the master puppeteers of the old regime from detection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed out that security force operatives applying for amnesty forfeited their chance of qualifying for state legal support should the matter go to court -- as with Coetzee -- since only those who maintained their innocence qualified under treasury regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McNally this week said he looked at matters &quot;from the other side&quot; to that of the commission. &quot;Is there anything to stop prosecutions where people have applied for amnesty or intend to ask?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Malan trial was not relevant to the amnesty debate, as the accused have maintained their innocence. In the Coetzee case, he has also not had any notification that the accused want a trial postponement pending their amnesty hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McNally said the attorneys general had met the commission -- and he was due to meet it again soon -- to discuss areas where their interests overlap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D'Oliveira was not available for comment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - Globalvision's &quot;Rights &amp; Wrongs&quot; this month is airing a special report on the human rights crisis in Nigeria, an issue that has received scant coverage in the American media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first week's program, hosted by Charlayne Hunter-Gault, examines the sanctions debate, reporting on a lobbying war between human rights groups and Nigeria's military rulers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The program identifies Al Lehn, former Senator Bob Dole's National Security Advisor, as a key lobbyist for the Nigerian military junta. It also features the first American broadcast of the last television interview with Nigerian environmental activist and writer Ken Saro-Wiwa who was hung by the military authorities after a trial that human rights groups denounced as a farce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The program offers the background on the current crisis featuring reports on, and interviews with, key players including: Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka, Hafsat Abiola, the daughter of Nigeria's imprisoned Presidential election victor Moshood Abiola, Innocent Chukwume, an official with Nigeria's Civil Liberties Organization, South Africa's Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and US human rights activists Randall Robinson of TransAfrica, Gay McDougall of the International Human Rights Law Group, Kakuna Kerina of the Committee to Protect Journalists, Gerald LeMelle of Amnesty International and Mike Fleshman of the Africa Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rights &amp; Wrongs shows videos provided by Witness and others produced for the Nigerian Embassy in the United States and the Shell Oil Company. Shell Oil met with Rights &amp; Wrongs but refused to allow its executives to go on camera. Nigeria's strong man General Abacha did not respond to interview requests.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Government has indicated that it will renew national team coach, Roald Poulsen's contract when it expires in October this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Permanent secretary in the Ministry of Sports, Arthur Yoyo, yesterday said Poulsen's endeavor to improve the standard of football in the country has been appreciated by any self respecting citizen of the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview at his office, Yoyo said when the coach's contract expires they would renegotiate with their Danish counterparts with a view of maintaining the coach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Poulsen would forge ahead to prepare the country for the forthcoming international competitions including the World Cup and the Africa Nation's Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the time comes to review his permit, the government of Zambia will decide appropriately in consultation with the Danish Government how best Poulsen's programme of preparing the National Soccer team for the World and Africa Cup qualifying games would be accomplished,&quot; Yoyo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Poulsen's contractual agreement in the country is between the Zambian Government and the Danish Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Therefore all contractual agreement of that nature are handled at that level and not at ministerial level,&quot; Yoyo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contacted for comments , Poulsen said the Government has not yet pronnounced anything to him and as such could not commit himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would be in a position to comment as soon as I get a correspondence from my employers,&quot; Poulsen said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlanta - Zambia continued its quest for medals in boxing following an impressive win by Davis Mwale who decisioned Steven Kevi of Papua New Guinea on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting in the Light Welterweight division, Mwale beat Kevi 16-3 on points as the Summer Olympics entered its fifth day of competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the victory, Mwale joins Bornface Mukuka and Dennis Zimba who have qualified to the second round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it is too early to start counting the medals, Mwale's outright victory over Kevi has caught the eyes of American journalists and agents who were not impressive with African boxers, especially when most of them lost on Saturday when the boxing competition started.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several agents called this journalist to find out whether any of the Zambian boxers were interested in turning professional. Queries were referred to the Zambian officials accompanying the boxers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for Mwale, Mukuka and Zimba, their minds must be focused on their second round bouts, especially Zimba who is scheduled to fight today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And today marks the beginning of the much awaited track and field events.  For Zambia, the hopes for track and field medals are in the running shoes of Ngozi Mwanamwambwa, Samuel Matete, Clinton Bufuku, Charles Mulinga, Godfrey Siamusiye and Frank Nkandu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwanamwambwa, the first Zambian track and field athlete to test the track, faces an onerous task in the 200 and 400 metre races. Although a proud holder of several collegiate titles in the United States, Ngozi is up against the best of the women sprinters in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 200 meters, she faces Merlene Ottey of Jamaica, Irina Privalova of Russia, Carlette Guidry of United States and Juliet Cuthbert of Jamaica. All these women have run the 200 meters race in less than 22 seconds.  Mwanamwambwa's best time ever is slightly above 22 seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even in the 400 meters, Mwanamwambwa is up against those that have run faster than her time, including France's Marie-Jose Perec whose 48.83 is as good as any of the men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In men's steepchase, where Siamusiye will be competing, the race has been deemed the Kenyan Olympics. Siamusiye, who is the current US college champion in 10,000 meters, admits he has to summon extra speed and endurance to even qualify to the semifinals of the competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this &quot;pick your favourite Kenyan,&quot; race 3-time world champ Moses Kiptanui is still the man. The World Record holder figures to lead his compatriot, Matthew Birir and Joseph Keter to at least their third consecutive 1-2 finish and maybe a repeat sweep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles Mulinga, who has won several international races in the 5,000 metres is also in the race favoured to be won by either Ethiopians or Kenyans.  Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia is the top pick while Kenyans</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Bitok, Tom Nyariki and Shem Kororia are also top contenders. The race also features two Moroccans who have ran faster that Mulinga's time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bufuku who competes in the 200 meters has nothing but miracles to perform in this race that is dominated by Americans and Namibian Frankie Fredericks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And so the best hope for a medal among Zambians is with former world and current commonwealth champion in 400 metre hurdles, Samuel Matete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matete, whose 47.10 time set at Zurich in 1991 is the best among those competing at this year's Olympics, is the favourite. He is so popular that he has to avoid the media before his race to concentrate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mindful of the fact that the Olympic medal is the only championship he has not won, Matete should also keep in mind the incident at the 92 Games when he was disqualified for allegedly stepping on the line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; I will do my talking on the track,&quot; Matete said before he left for Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matete's strongest rivals are Americans Derrick Adkins and Bryan Bronson who have forged a great rivalry the last few years. Matete ranked No. 1 in '94, Adkins took over last year. So far, Matete has been almost unbeatable, while Adkins has chinks in his armor. U.S. champ Bronson is shy on experience at this level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Zambia's only medal at the Olympics was achieved by the late Keith Mwila here in the United States at the 1984 Games, maybe luck will hold that Zambia's first Gold Medal will be won in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And talking about medals, United States continued its relentless mining of Olympic silverware by increasing their tally to 28 medals against Russia's 23 medals. Russia, however, has an edge winning eleven Gold medals to U.S. 10 Gold medals. Interestingly, at the end of day five of competition, Great Britain has only one medal - a bronze.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Over K80 million will be spent by the Show Society of Zambia (SSZ) in organising this year's national agricultural and commercial show, disclosed convenor, Ezra Sakala, in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Sakala, this represents almost double what the society spent last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have spent slightly over K80 million in preparations and we hope to raise more than what we are pumping in,&quot; said Sakala, who is also the vice president of the SSZ.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sakala was declined to reveal who the guest of honour will be this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I cannot at this point say who the guest of honour will be,&quot; Sakala said. &quot; It's up to State House to tell us who the guest of honour will be. I don't know whether it will be the President or a foreign dignitary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a source, who declined to be named, said all the dignitaries who have been invited so far have spurned the invitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All presidents from neighbouring countries have refused to come because of the political situation in the country,&quot; the source said. The show has always been opened by presidents of neighbouring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Sakala has disclosed that there has been a shift on the type of exhibitors at this year's show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The dwindling parastatal sector has led to a shift from the large scale to the small and medium scale exhibitor,&quot; Sakala said, adding: &quot;I don't know if this is an indication of what is happening to our economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He, however, noted that there has been an overwhelming turn-out of exhibitors for this year's show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The turn-out is higher than last year,&quot; Sakala said. &quot;We are still having companies coming to ask for space. We are expecting exhibitors from Sweden, Russia, the USA, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sakala further disclosed that despite the brahuha that the mad cow disease has caused in the United Kingdom, the society will be exhibiting British beef.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are calling this year 'the year of the British beef' and we will be exhibiting British beef as well as other exotic varieties,&quot; Sakala said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, according to Sakala, for the first time the livestock section will have on display Ostriches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will be interesting to see what products the Ostrich can offer,&quot; Sakala said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For entertainment, the society has lined up a variety of entertainers, among them the Zambia Army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Zambia Army has been absent from the show for sometime now. This year they will put up silent drills, artillery assembling drills and calisthenics,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A South African motor cycle stuntman, Gathro, has also been invited while a new group of majorettes called the Country Girls will entertain the little ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commercial committee chairman, Dev Babber, said at a press briefing yesterday that all was set and most of the exhibitors have met the deadline for preparing their stands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are satisfied with the preparations so far,&quot; Babber said. &quot;We are confident that the quality of stands will be of great satisfaction.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Secretaries of opposition political parties yesterday met at the offices of the Liberal Progressive Front (LPF) in Lusaka where they resolved that they all meet on Monday to lay the ground work for the inter-party talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) deputy general secretary, Azwell Banda, said in an interview last night that all secretaries present unanimously agreed to meet on Monday as time was running out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are inviting the MMD secretary, Michael Sata, to this meeting so that we can prepare the ground work for the inter-party talks,&quot; Banda said. &quot;The sooner we resolve the issue of the Constitution and electoral process, the better because time is running out.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sata, in a telephone interview last night, said opposition secretaries have not communicated with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Banda stressed that &quot;time was running out&quot; and insisted that the talks should be held before the end of the verification of the voters register.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Time is running out and this was recognised by all secretaries at today's meeting,&quot; Banda said. &quot;One hopes Sata will respond positively.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And ZDC president Dean Mung'omba yesterday charged that the MMD was not ready for dialogue with the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mung'omba said the MMD's insistence on preconditions before inter-party talks proved it was not ready for dialogue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to MMD national secretary, minister without portfolio Michael Sata's insistence that ZDC should write a letter indicating its willingness to accept President Chiluba to chair the talks, Mung'omba said that was taking his &quot;good intentions a bit too far&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sata's response is unfair and shows lack of seriousness,&quot; Mung'omba said. &quot; I get the impression that it is them and not the opposition who are not interested in meeting.&quot; Mung'omba suggested that instead of putting conditions, a preliminary meeting of secretaries could be held where details of how the meeting should proceed could be worked out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Preliminary meetings shall have to be held under which we can discuss the management of the meeting which include the agenda,&quot; Mung'omba said. &quot;We are not going to narrow our position in the newspapers, such a meeting is where we shall discuss the details.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mung'omba in an interview on Tuesday said his party was ready to compromise over the chairmanship of the inter-party talks and have President Chiluba chair so as to meet the MMD's demand in the interest of progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Liberal Progressive Front (LPF) chairman Roger Chongwe disagreed with Mung'omba that President Chiluba should chair the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No person can be a judge and jury in his own case, we need a neutral chairman,&quot; Chongwe said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chongwe said President Chiluba's decision to assent to the constitution and his refusal to listen to calls for the cancellation of the Nikuv contract showed he was not interested in dialogue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even if we talk to him today what will he do?&quot; Chongwe asked. &quot;He does not want to talk, he is not serious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Democratic Party (NDP) said the initiative of resuming the talks lies with the government and it was up to them to announce the date for talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would therefore clear a lot of doubts and remove the prevalent atmosphere of uncertainty if the MMD government took the bold step of showing total and unquestionable commitment to the talks by proposing dates for these talks,&quot; said NDP national trustee Derrick Sinjela in a statement yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sinjela, however, welcomed statements from Sata and Vice-President Godfrey Miyanda expressing readiness to hold inter-party talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, ZDC has adopted a retired teacher Munyinda Siyanga, as its candidate for the Mongu Central by-elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement from ZDC yesterday said Munyinda, a former Regional Examinations officer for Western Province, was selected in March and was now being given the chance to stand.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - The State Department July 25 issued the following statement and communique on the meeting of the 13-member International Contact Group on Liberia, which took place in Washington on July 18:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 18, 1996, the International Contact Group on Liberia met in Washington, D.C. The countries comprising the ICGL include Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representatives from each of these member nations, as well as representatives from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the European Commission, were present at the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Group voiced continuing support for the Abuja framework and commended ECOWAS for its active role in the restoration of peace in Monrovia. ICGL members also pledged their continued support for the peace process and discussed several ways in which they could further assist ECOWAS in attaining a sustainable peace in Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attached is the Communique issued at the conclusion of the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Contact Group on Liberia held its third meeting in Washington D.C., July 18, 1996. Representatives from Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States as well as ECOWAS (the Economic Community of West African states), the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity and the European Commission attended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting heard reports on the situation in Liberia and on preparations for the Economic Community of West African states (ECOWAS) Summit that will convene July 26. The Contact Group expressed appreciation for the roles ECOWAS as well as the U.N. and OAU have taken in the Liberian peace process, commended Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings for his leadership over the past two years and encouraged ECOWAS to remain actively engaged in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Group voiced support for the Abuja framework and hoped the ECOWAS Summit would determine ways to strengthen its implementation. Members commended the West African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) for its efforts to restore Monrovia as a civilian safehaven and encouraged ECOMOG to maintain calm in Monrovia and its environs. Members called on Liberian faction leaders to honor the cease-fire and move forward on disarmament and demobilization in order to create a secure environment where electoral activity can take place within a reasonable timeframe and the population is able to express its will freely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Affirming that the peace process needs the support of the international community, Contact Group members agreed to continue to explore ways they could assist the peace process, including the ECOMOG peacekeepers. Training and equipment assistance as well as possible logistical support for additional troop contributions by ECOWAS member states were discussed. The Group further underscored the importance of donor countries redeeming the pledges made at the United Nations sponsored Conference on Liberia in October 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the Contact Group urged Liberian factional leaders to honor the Abuja framework, respect the decisions of the ECOWAS summit, and cooperate fully with the peacekeeping efforts of ECOMOG as well as the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) and with the humanitarian efforts of the international community and nongovernmental organizations. Continued noncooperation with the ECOWAS peace process and disregard for humanitarian law and human rights could influence the international community to seek measures against the violators.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns on July 25 announced a series of measures aimed at expressing U.S. displeasure over the conduct of the recent election in Niger:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The July 21 acceptance by the Nigerien Supreme Court of the results of the recent presidential election in Niger does not change the view of the United States that the electoral process was fraudulent. The regime of General Ibrahim Mainassara Bare seriously compromised the validity of the process by abolishing the independent electoral commission on the second day of voting and replacing it with a national commission controlled by the government, by barring party representatives and independent observers from the vote counting centers on the second day, and by placing the political candidates opposing General Bare under house arrest. The government-appointed electoral commission subsequently announced provisional results showing voter participation and votes for Bare significantly greater on the second day than on the first. As a consequence, we do not believe the announced outcome of the elections is a true reflection of the wishes of the Nigerien people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This derailing of the electoral process was particularly regrettable given the compliance with election laws and the strong emphasis on transparency that characterized the 1993 legislative and presidential elections and the 1995 parliamentary elections, which enjoyed the confidence of the Nigerien electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States is also deeply concerned by the violations of human rights and repression of civilian freedom conducted by the Bare regime immediately following the dissolution of the independent electoral commission and continuing through the past weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to Niger's clear abandonment of democracy, evident in both the military coup earlier this year and the fraudulent election, the United States is:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Terminating current bilateral USAID assistance programs to the Government of Niger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Withdrawing and not replacing the Security Assistance Officer in our Embassy in Niamey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Continuing to suspend all military assistance programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just as the U.S. is terminating its current assistance programs to the Government of Niger, we expect other donors are examining their assistance to Niger. If earlier assistance pledges erode significantly, this could regrettably have negative implications for the sustainability of Niger's structural adjustment program with the IMF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We call upon all interested governments to express their disapproval of the fraudulent elections in Niger and to join with us in taking measures to support the people of Niger by pressing for the return to democracy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States congratulates the Chadian people on the maturity and conviction which they demonstrated while voting in Chad's first-ever multiparty presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We applaud those Chadians who have worked hard to promote a free, fair and transparent election, but we regret the many reports of irregular practices which undermine the credibility of the electoral process. These reports include the banning of meetings, government interference in the electoral process, intimidation of voters and opposition party representatives and manipulation of vote counts. All are contrary to internationally accepted standards for free, fair and transparent elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States will pay close attention to the upcoming legislative elections, and calls on the Chadian government, political parties and the traditional friends of Chad to work together to ensure a free, fair and transparent election of Chad's first multiparty legislature.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabwe - China will this year start processing copper and production of copper rods in Kabwe, visiting Chinese deputy governor for Jiangxi province, Zhou Zhiping, confirmed in Kabwe today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking when he paid a courtesy call on Kabwe mayor, James Chansa, at the civic centre, Mr Zhou said he was happy to learn that the Zambian government through Kabwe municipal council had solved the land issue where the plant would be erected before the end of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am pleased to learn that the land issue has been solved. This is a good start. The project will not only affect Jiangxi provice, but the central government of China as well. With cooperation from local leadership, the project will start before the end of this year,&quot; Mr Zhou informed the mayor, councillors and chief officers who welcomed his delegation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chinese delegation also include Mr Ren Hong Sui, vice-general manager and senior engineer for China Jiangzi Corporation, Mr Hu Renbao, vice president, China Jiangxi Corporation for water conservation and hydropower construction and Mr Ma De Diang, senior economist in the same corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are here to inspect the site where the copper processing plant would be built.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his brief welcome remarks the mayor said his council has expidited the allocation of land and the title deed issued by the Zambian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had earlier expidited procurement of investment licence. The only thing we are waiting for is to have full technical details of your project so that environmental council of Zambia can assess the impact of the project in the environment,&quot; Mr Chansa told the four-man delegation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Kabwe has a reservior of highly trained and experienced industrial personnel, abundant land while rail and road network have been developed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are looking forward to more Chinese investments from your province in the field of agriculture, industrial, mining, housing and wood processing,&quot; Mr Chansa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chinese delegation earlier paid a courtesy call on central province deputy minister, Mr David Mpamba who appealed for more foreign investors to bring industries and create jobs for local Zambian people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mpamba who was flanked by his provincial acting permanent secretary geoffrey akafekwa thanked the people of China for continued cooperation in many fields.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Zambian government will not recognise the Pierre Buyoya led military regime that snatched power from legitimate Burundi President Sylvester Ntibantunganya on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Affairs Minister Lieutenant-General Christon Tembo said in Lusaka today that Zambia supports the stand taken by the Organisation of African nity (OAU) to condemn the coup in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gen Tembo said Zambia will as a member of the OAU work closely with the African body to see how best the situation in Burundi can be normalised.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimbabwe and South African governments have also said that they will not recognise the Buyoya military government which has already taken measures aimed at restoring peace in the trouble-torn central African state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Buyoya regime has imposed a dusk to dawn curfew throughout the country, disbanded the Burundi parliament and closed the international airport and borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gen Tembo said although the cabinet has not yet sat to discuss the Burundi issue, government is already agreeable to the stand taken by the OAU announced soon after the coup by secretary-general, Salim Ahmed Salim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another development, Gen Tembo could not confirm when President Chiluba apologised to the Southern African heads of state for statements made by some cabinet ministers on the internal affairs of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gen Tembo said he was unable to give a local confirmation to the reported apology announced by Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe during a news conference at a SADC meeting in Mozambique yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister has just returned from a business trip in Ethiopia, East Africa and some neighbouring countries but did not disclose the purpose of the trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimbabwean leader is quoted to have said that President Chiluba has apologised to his counter-parts in the region for the remarks made some cabinet ministers accusing them of meddling in the internal affairs of Zambia.</SPAN></P>

Sebe was convicted of malicious damage to property and jailed for nine years on this charge. In a later trial, he was jailed for 12 years after being convicted, again of malicious damange to property, for the bombing of a house in Peddie in December 1989.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlanta - Morale of Botswana athletes at the Olympics has not been deterred by the explosion of a pipe bomb that killed two people and injured 110 others early Saturday morning at the Centennial Olympic Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have confidence in the security, hence our training has not been affected&quot; Coach Raj Rathedi said Sunday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Dipeba takes the track on July 31st in the 200m dash while the 4 by 400 metres relay team competes on August 2nd and Marathon runner Benjamin Keleketu fares on August 4.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of spectators and tourists have put on a brave face and attendance has not dwindled in the different sporting events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile the Park has been closed while the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) are investigating and will be opened with increased security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to the accident, American President Bill Clinton said it was &quot; an act of cowardice that stands in sharp contrast to the courage of the Olympic athletes.&quot; But, he said, the Olympic spirit will prevail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the press on July 28 the President of the International Olympic Committee, Juan Antonio Samaranch expressed sympathy to the families and friends of those affected by the explosion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am very grateful to the authorities for the excellent response and the security measures that have been taken&quot; Samaranch said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IOC head further said the important part of the Olympics, the competitions, were going extremely well. He said records were being broken both on the track and by the largest number of spectators the Olympic have ever enjoyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And many interviewed said they will not be discouraged to make the Olympics their best of times. Although extra-cautious the streets are still streaming with tourists and the mood for the games has not gone down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Turkish journalist covering the games died of heart attack while rushing to the blast scene where an unidentified woman died on the spot after the 1.  25 am explosion that shocked thousands who were enjoying a music concert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 21 acre Park was a colorful combination of merchandise and souvenirs exhibitions, kioks and many were lured to this area like a metal to a magnet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now the scene is depressed in emptiness as the police survey the area in hunt for evidence that could lead them to the man who up0setted the whole mood of the Olympics and left many scarred for their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But still the Olympic spirit persists, although now with the observation of a moment of silence in every event and flags at half mast, and athletes are setting new records both in the track and field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canadian Donovan Bailey became the fastest man in the world when he won the 100 metres dash at 9.84 seconds upsetting 9.85 previous world record and beating the favourite, Namibian Frankie Fredericks to the second spot at 9.89 seconds. Third was Trinidad's Ota Boldon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defending champion Linford Christe was disgraced out after qualifying for the finals for a double false-start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gail Devers of the United States won the ladies race at the same time with Jamaican Merelian Oti. The drama on the track continues to unfold as is in other fields of this centennial Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOTE: Dibeela, who reports for the Botswana Press Agency, is covering the Olympics under a special program between The Freedom Forum and the International Olympic Committee.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - The following is an &quot;Update and Alert&quot; on Liberia from the Washington Office on Africa (WOA), a not-for-profit church, trade union and civil rights group supported organization that works with Congress on Africa- related legislation:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a resurgence of violence last spring, relative calm has returned to parts of the Liberian capital, Monrovia, over the past two months. The West African peacekeeping force has regained control over the city and armed factions loyal to different warlords have been separated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the peace process which collapsed violently in April is not back on track. The humanitarian situation remains desperate. International involvement, whether from West African states or the broader international community, still falls far short of the measures necessary to curb the power of the warlords and open up space for Liberian civilians to reestablish a functioning society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States and others are discussing the prospects of holding elections in Liberia before the end of the year. Liberian civic groups as well as outside observers, however, warn that meaningful elections are impossible unless the power of the warlords is effectively checked. They emphasize the need for disarmament and demobilization of the factional fighters, monitored by a more effective international military presence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the April explosion of violence in Monrovia, the United States has kept open its embassy there and has taken a higher-profile role in the peace process. Washington has pledged an additional $30 million to the West African peacekeeping force, known as ECOMOG, to enable it to maintain minimum levels of stability so that longer-term peace efforts and humanitarian relief can go forward. The U.S. government has also stated strongly that the international community will isolate anyone taking governmental power in Liberia by force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite these steps, the current level of international involvement remains insufficient. Without a higher level of engagement by the United States in particular, renewed peace efforts will be vulnerable to violent and repeated collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To increase the chances of sustainable peace, diplomatic and humanitarian assistance must be accompanied by support for:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* An adequate international peacekeeping presence, to ensure disarmament of the factions. This may require an expanded United Nations force if ECOMOG proves incapable of the task;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Sanctions to deter and restrict the international trading channels by which Liberian warlords exchange diamonds and other Liberian resources for arms;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A greater voice for Liberian civilians at home and outside the country, such as by convening a broad national conference with international sponsorship and support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six Years of War</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia was founded in the early 19th century by African Americans who returned to Africa as settlers. Their descendants, known as Americo-Liberians, dominated the country's government for more than 150 years. Ties with the United States were close, with continuing high levels of aid and investment.  In the 1960s and 1970s, Liberia received the highest per capita level of U.S.  aid of any country on the African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1980 the settler-dominated government was overthrown. Many Liberians hoped for reform and a shift of power to the indigenous 95% of the population.  But military leader Samuel Doe bypassed grassroots opposition groups and ran a military dictatorship, favoring his own small ethnic group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States provided massive support for the Doe regime in the 1980s, with a total of $402 million in aid between 1981 and 1985--more than during the entire previous century. At the time Liberia was a key staging post for a large-scale covert U.S. operation against Libya's Muammar Qaddafi. Washington continued its support for Doe despite documented human rights violations and a 1985 election widely seen to be marked by fraud and repression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late 1989 insurgents led by Charles Taylor crossed into Liberia from the Ivory Coast, beginning a war against the Doe regime. The conflict led to high levels of atrocities against civilians by Taylor's forces, the remnants of Doe's army, and as many as five other armed factions. Doe himself was killed by another rebel leader in September 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington provided humanitarian aid--more than $425 million from 1990 through mid-1995. But former U.S. officials testify that they were instructed not to take an active role in peacemaking. The initiative for peacekeeping and peace negotiations was left to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), with Nigeria playing a leading role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The West African peace-keeping force arrived in late 1990, after the conflict was well under way. Its intervention has been flawed, but is generally credited with saving lives. West African governments meanwhile have supported continuing mediation efforts. The most recent is the Abuja accord of August 1995, which provided for an interim government involving all the warlords, and for the disarming and demobilization of their forces before elections this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Abuja accord came after almost six years of war which killed as many as 150,000 out of a population of 2.6 million. Some 800,000 people fled the country as refugees, and more than a million were displaced from their homes within the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accord Breaks Down</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Implementation of the Abuja agreement depended on either the goodwill of the warlords or decisive international support for their disarmament. Neither materialized. Liberian civilians were kept out of the process, and the predictable breakdown came in April when warlord Charles Taylor decided to launch an attack in Monrovia against a rival force. Both sides had by then infiltrated armed forces into the capital, previously a relatively safe haven from the conflict in the countryside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fighting forced the evacuation of humanitarian relief agencies. Their supplies were looted by the warlords, who used the relief goods for military ends. In mid-June, 13 international agencies said they would not reestablish full operations in Liberia until minimal security can be assured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting has recently recurred in several other parts of the country.  Despite the relative normalcy in the capital, Liberians say that off the main streets there is no security. Basic services, such as electricity and running water, are not available, and food is scarce. During June over 1,500 bodies were recovered by health workers from shallow graves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The primary responsibility for the war over the last six years--and for the latest violence in Monrovia--lies with the leaders of the Liberian armed factions, who have put their personal quests for power above the desire of Liberians for peace. The record of the West African peacekeeping force, which brought some stability to parts of Liberia, has been mixed, and its failure to react when violence broke out in April contributed to the high level of destruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the international community must also shoulder a large share of the blame. In the case of Liberia, with 150 years of close U.S. ties, &quot; international community&quot; means above all the United States. The U.S. failure to respond to the initial outbreak of war in 1989-1990 cost the lives of thousands of Liberians and close to $500 million in emergency aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the latest peace agreement was signed, many observers warned that it was doomed to collapse without adequate international support for disarmament and demobilization of the militias and for the peacekeeping efforts of ECOMOG.  That support did not come. This failure invited a costly humanitarian disaster and set the scene for the evacuation of U.S. citizens and many other foreign residents in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giving Peace a Chance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority of Liberians want peace. But the chances of achieving it are slim unless the capacity of the warlords to make war is curbed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberian civil leaders and traditional rulers, meeting with ECOWAS leaders in mid-July, urged strong international sanctions against faction leaders to enforce compliance with peace agreements. They stressed that ECOMOG should be empowered and provided with logistical support to enforce peace by disarming combatants, as a precondition to free elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian leaders also demanded that the international community impose sanctions on the export of Liberian natural resources by the warlords. &quot;On no account should there be elections without first complete disarmament, encampment and integration of these combatants into the society,&quot; stated the chair of the Liberian Bar Association, Frederick Cherue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In sum, three basic steps are needed if Liberian civilians are to have a chance to rebuild their society. The United States must play an active role in providing high-level and consistent diplomatic pressure and financial resources in support of the entire process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) The international peacekeeping force already on the ground must be maintained and upgraded. West African states must continue to play a central role in peacemaking and peacekeeping, regardless of the shortcomings of their past involvement and doubts about the future. (Leadership of West African peacemaking efforts is shifting, as Ghana's President Jerry Rawlings ended his term as chair of ECOWAS in late July. His successor is General Sani Abacha, head of the Nigerian military regime.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the West African states do not have the diplomatic clout, the credibility, or the logistical resources to do the job entirely on their own.  The ECOMOG force needs adequate logistical support. Its efforts also need to be supplemented by consistent backup and monitoring from the wider international community, including an expanded United Nations peacekeeping presence which can balance the West African role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) The peace process must be linked to plans for disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of combatants. Continued participation by faction leaders in the political process should be contingent on their cooperation with disarmament, as specified in the Abuja peace agreement. The warlords likely will only comply with such demands if action is taken to block the flow of arms. This includes strong and effective pressure on neighboring countries, particularly Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, and Guinea, to restrict the supplies of arms to the factions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, disarmament will not be possible without simultaneous planning for demobilization. Successful reintegration of former combatants into civilian life in turn depends on the creation of economic opportunities within the civilian economy. Delay in planning these elements was one of the main reasons for the failure to disarm in the period since last fall. Such a comprehensive plan will be costly. But it is more practical--and, in the long term less expensive--than responding to repeated humanitarian emergencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) Steps must be taken to guarantee a more active role for civilian institutions in the transition. Last year's Abuja accord was praised by some and criticized by others for making the faction leaders the key players in the transitional government leading to elections. This could only work if prompt disarmament and international protection for civilians were implemented simultaneously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The peace process should provide political space for the vast majority of unarmed Liberians and Liberian civic institutions. It must not be held hostage by any of the armed faction leaders. Unless new measures are taken to protect and encourage vibrant civilian political activity, the peace process will be again be doomed to fail.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. CONTACT THE ADMINISTRATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Write to National Security Advisor Anthony Lake and to Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Urge that the United States increase its active engagement in the search for peace in Liberia. Talking points:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The United States bears special responsibility for helping to resolve the situation in Liberia because of its historical ties to Liberia and U.S. aid to the Doe regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Peace agreements cannot succeed without much more active international support for disarmament and demobilization of factional fighters, and for West African and international peacekeeping efforts. This requires sanctions to block the flow of arms to the warlords.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Liberian civilian institutions must play a more active role in the transition to a legitimate government. Elections will only be meaningful if there is security and a real opportunity for Liberian civilians, inside and outside of Liberia, to have a greater voice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Following is the text of the statement by State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns on the presidential elections in Sao Tome and Principe:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States commends the people of Sao Tome and Principe upon the successful conclusion of their presidential elections and congratulates President Miguel Trovoada on his re-election. Throughout the two-round electoral process, the National Electoral Commission worked closely with international observers, including some sponsored by the United States.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are pleased to report that observer teams found the elections to have been free and fair. We also note reports that former President Pinto da Costa has conceded and pledged to work for the good of his country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Less than a year ago, we commended Sao Tome and Principe for demonstrating that reason can prevail over force when President Trovoada was restored to office after a week-long attempted coup. At that time, we expressed the hope that the restoration of the democratically elected government would lead all parties in Sao Tome and Principe to rededicate themselves to democratic ideals and practices. We now urge all of the citizens of Sao Tome and Principe to work with their elected leaders through the established government bodies. We also urge their leaders to redouble their efforts on behalf of the people of Sao Tome and Principe</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Royal Norwegian government has said gender support is among its first five priorities for donor aid to Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second secretary for development cooperation at the Norway embassy Kikkan Haugen said at Lusaka's Pamodzi Hotel last Friday, during the official launching of Women Entrepreneurs Development Association of Zambia (WEDAZ) that for sustainable development to take place, women must be supported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Women play a very significant role in productive activities, and development can only be sustainable if women participate fully,&quot; Haugen said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And our list of areas that should be given priority, in supporting measures that improve the situation of women producers is among the top five, and this strategy is not one that only exists on paper, but is one that has had very practical consequences,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haugen whose NORAD gave WEDAZ about K18 million to set up a secretariat also disclosed that the 1992 bilateral development cooperation with Zambia has a very substantial share aimed at women development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nearly all the activities that are supported by Norway have taken gender issues into consideration, because we believe that the endeavours you are involved in are of utmost importance for the development of Zambia,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Community development deputy minister Lt Colonel Scholastic Ngoma urged WEDAZ to be transparent in the use of the grant they got from NORAD to inspire other donors to provide more support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The temptation to use a larger portion of the grant to corver administrative costs should be desisted, we will be encouraged if the grant would be used o support well designed programmes which can contribute to sustainable development,&quot; Ngoma said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said her ministry supports initiatives aimed at building capacities in communities, especially among disadvantaged groups, like women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Disadvantaged groups must be assisted to become economically strong and productive, by implementing appropriate strategies in consultation and with the support of cooperating partners,&quot; Ngoma said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WEDAZ chairperson Vivian Mthetwa said her organisation will conduct training for women entrepreneurs so they can run their businesses effectively and will set up a revolving fund to provide loans to women.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlanta - Zambia's medal hopeful Samuel Matete on Monday morning eased to the semi-finals of the 400m hurdles in the on going Centennial Olympic games when he posted the fastest time of 48.21 seconds to finish first ahead of seven others in heat three of the competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matete, the 1991 world champion, is entering the event as a favourite to mint the gold but he has to beat current world champion Derrick Adkins of the United States of America who also qualified to the semi finals with a time of 48.46 seconds in heat seven.The current world and Olympic times of 46.78 and 46.78 respectively were set by Kevin Young of the United States of America at the Barcelona games in 1992.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matete, whose personal time of 47.10 is the best here and with which he won the world championship title in 1991 in Japan, took off from his block in lane five like a rabbit and flew over the hurdles like a gazelle, rounding the last corner ahead of the pack with powerful graceful strides which have seen him win all his events in Europe in the last few months prior to the Atlanta Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the semifinals would miss the expected tough competition among the world's greatest hurdlers following the pulling out of Jamaica's Winthrop Graham because of a knee injury he sustained 80m after starting the race.  Graham was running in heat five from which Jon Ridgeon of Great Britain and Marc Dollendorf of Belgium qualified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matete and Adkins have met three times this year and all occasions, the Zambian has won.He is making his third attempt at winning an Olympic medal after the last two attempts flopped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Monday's event, all the runners were forced to run at top speed to get to the next round and Matete's time, the best so far, probably indicates that he is capable of lowering it to emerge the first and win the gold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other Zambian likely to win the other medal, Godfrey Siamusiye, was also being expected to run his 3000m steeplechase competition last night.  Siamusiye and 5000m runner Fackson Nkandu, who takes to the tracks on Thursday are the only two Zambians apart from Matete competing in the Olympics following the exit of the four boxers who lost all their fights in the second qualifying round.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABUJA, Nigeria (PANA) - The out-going field commmander of the West African Peace Keeping Force in Liberia (ECOMOG), Maj.Gen. John Mark Inienger, has said the strength of the force should be raised to at least 18,000 men to enable it accomplish its mission in the war-torn country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The peace mission, sent to Monrovia by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in August 1990, is currently estimated at 8,500 soldiers, with Nigeria having the largest contingent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The force has so far failed to end the six-year-old civil war in Africa's oldest republic, due mainly to the uncooperative attitude of the warring factions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To compel them to give us cooperation, ECOMOG needs to have an overwhelming presence in Liberia,&quot; Inienger told PANA in Abuja, where he attended the just-ended ECOWAS summit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he drew a parallel between &quot;peace-enforcement&quot; and the &quot;deterrent force&quot;, which is being advocated, saying that apart from enhanced numerical strength, ECOMOG should also be properly equipped if it is to be credible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we talk about strength, we are not talking only of numbers. We are talking about armed personnel carriers, helicopter gunships and what have you, &quot; he said, adding, &quot;once you get all these things, you should be able to assert yourself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inienger, ECOMOG commander for the past three years, also accused the Liberian warlords of lacking good faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the peace agreements to be implemented, all parties have to demonstrate good faith. That, in the case of Liberia, is lacking,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They (the warlords),&quot; the general said, &quot;come to the conference table, agree and sign a document in a most ceremonious manner, only to go back on the ground to renege on the agreement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian war has killed at least 150,000 people, despite some 13 peace accords and more than 50 meetings held to stop it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inienger said the weakness of ECOMOG was also most visible in its inability to enforce an arms embargo along Liberia's borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the force was only able to restore Monrovia to the current state of relative peace, after fighting and looting resumed April 6, when troops deployed to the hinterland to monitor disarmament, were called in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For arms restrictions to succeed, the general said, countries sharing borders with Liberia, should prevent the warring factions from smuggling ammunition through their territories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inienger said he supported sanctions against the factions to make them see reason, but warned that ECOWAS members should harmonise the measures to eliminate possible loopholes that could be exploited by them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also chided those in the international community that had made pledges to the peace effort that they had failed to honour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People made pledges and some of the pledges have not been fulfilled...  even as we continue to cry for resources to beef up our strength,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outgoing ECOMOG field commander rejected the suggestion that making the warlords members of the Liberian Council of State under the 1995 Abuja peace agreement was a mistake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it was much more difficult to negotiate with them in their various enclaves. &quot;We must do everything to retain them so that we can continue to talk to them,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On whether to hold an election before disarmament in Liberia, Inienger said all agreements on Liberia had been predicated on disarmament, &quot;but the bottleneck has been the unwillingness of the parties to disarm.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To get round the problem, he said, disarmament could be &quot;by-passed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a possibility, it has been done elsewhere, it can be done in Liberia,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, elections could be held in safe havens in Liberia and among Liberian refugee populations across West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The population of Monrovia, put at 400,000 before the war started in 1989, is now estimated at 1.2 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inienger said this number and Liberians abroad, could add up to 70 percent of the country's estimated 2.5 million population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That can confidently take you to an election provided you involve the international community,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inienger, a former Nigerian state governor, has been redeployed to head the country's army Command and Staff College, in the northern city of Jaji.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maj.Gen. Victor Malu, one-time ECOMOG chief of staff, is the new commander of the peace force in Liberia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRIPOLI, Libya (PANA) - Libyan leader Col. Moammar Kadhafi has appealed to the international community not to condemn Burundi's new president without understanding the circumstances that led to his reinstallation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is useless for the time being to condemn the new Burundian President Pierre Buyoya without understanding the circumstances which led to his comeback,&quot; Kadhafi said in a statement issued to PANA in Tripoli.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Maj. Buyoya has taken power with the aim of stopping the ongoing ethnic massacre and enhance security in Burundi, &quot;he should rather be supported and we should not be hostile to him&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maj. Buyoya, a retired Tutsi officer who led Burundi from 1987 to 1993, was returned to power by the Tutsi-dominated army Thursday in a bloodless military coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He took over from President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, a Hutu, who went into hiding at the United States embassy in Bujumbura Tuesday last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ntibantunganya went to the embassy after being pelted with stones as he arrived for the burial of over 300 Tutsis who were massacred at a camp for displaced people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing diplomats here Monday, Buyoya said he would announce a new cabinet within the next two days.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He would, he added, involve dignitaries from the majority Hutu ethnic group in the new government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged Hutu personalities who have taken refuge in foreign embassies to return home, promising them state protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The international community which you represent has to understand the goal of the ongoing action is to avert a genocide&quot;, Buyoya told the diplomats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new president made a similar remark Sunday during a news conference, explaining that he did not return to power through a &quot;classical coup d'etat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, the decision of the Burundian army to return him to power was &quot;an action to save a people in danger and to restore peace through dialogue with all those who agree to lay down their weapons&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buyoya was beaten in the multiparty elections of 1993, six years after he had seized power in a military coup d'etat.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Mrs. Betty Bigombe, Uganda's Minister of State for the Pacification of the North pulled out of the hotly contested Gulu Municipality election race last month and flew out to the United States for post-graduate studies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of her departure, Mr. Norbert Mao, her challenger for the parliamentary seat was declared winner, ending weeks of acrimonious dispute over the validity of the election results that initially gave Mr. Nobert Mao, a youthful lawyer, 8,830 to Mrs. Bigombe's 7,089 votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The results of the June 27 parliamentary elections were nullified by Uganda's Electoral Commission following Mrs. Bigombe's angry denounciation of alleged malpractices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before leaving, the accomplished peacemaker and diplomat held a meeting with her campaign workers at which it was decided she quit the race. The campaign managers were particularly riled by her opponent's alleged tactics including depicting Bigombe as an obstacle to peace in Acholiland, northern Uganda.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Her opponent has depicted the insurgency in the north as a war between Mrs.  Bigombe and the people, when actually it is an act of rebellion against the government. They seem to think that the removal of the candidate from affairs of the North would end the problem,&quot; lamented her chief campaigner Mr. Sam Oduny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Bigombe clearly feels betrayed by her own people. Her departure was also seen as a security measure as she could have been harmed by rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) who have proved quite irrational in their recent actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of her most recent disappointments was the killing in cold blood of two Acholi elders by the LRA on June 13. The two elders, Samson Okot-Ogoni and Chief Olanya Lagoni were killed while on mission to make contact with the rebels as a prelude for substantive discussions between them and the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers, say it became clear to Mrs Bigombe that her 10 years of pursuing peace and getting the rebels to stop the rapes, looting, arson and abductions of boys and girls for enforced conscription to their ranks, had taken a major setback. She may also have felt betrayed that President Yoweri Museveni abandoned her when she encountered severe problems with her electoral opponent in the parliamentary elections. Museveni could have continued to list Mrs. Bigombe in his cabinet appointments announced on July 6 purely for moral support but this was not his style. Instead the President announced the appointment of Owiny Dollo to replace Mrs. Bigombe as peacemaker in the north.  Like his predecessor, Mr. Dollo is an Acholi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another significant appointment is that of Dr. Martin Alliker as Minister of State for Foreign Affairs. Alliker, a professional dentist in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, and Kampala for many years, is also a traditional chief of the Acholis of Kitgum District. A wealthy man, he has substantial international business contacts. He is a relative of the late General Tito Okello, former Head of State who died last June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For her incessant campaigning for peace, Bigombe was named woman of the year by one of Uganda's leading newspapers, the Monitor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I first came to this post, the rebel groups were numerous and enjoyed the support of about 90 per cent of the populations,&quot; she observed in 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bigombe, in her mid-40s was based at the Gulu Military Barracks. She often flew in a government helicopter from one bush stop to another, seeking peace and encouraging the rebels to understand that the government of the day was here to stay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the rebels were former soldiers in the disbanded Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA). They feared that the post-1986 government of President Yoweri Museveni would penalize them for the atrocities they committed against the people in other parts of Uganda, notably in the Luwero Triangle in the north, where tens of thousands were massacred in the early 80s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was one of a handful of northerners to support the cause of the National Resistance Army (NRA) of Yoweri Museveni, indeed as early as 1983.  She argued that &quot;the north needs a new face in politics&quot; and was rewarded with a job to pacify the north by encouraging ex- UNLA to come to terms with the new situation in Uganda. Her ministry often had meagre funds and sometimes lived off the Army to make any headway in the dangerous task of making contacts with the unpredictable rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was motivated by her instinctive understanding of the Ugandan situation and once said that Joseph Kony, the former Catholic catechist turned rebel leader, &quot;had absolutely no motive for taking over the government.&quot; Her quest for peace for her own Acholi homeland was made doubly difficult by the fact that nobody knew the rebels' agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her biggest success so far, is convincing the military to treat surrendering rebels humanely. Such people are given counselling at a World Vision facility in Gulu and are allowed to return to their communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Yoweri Museveni once observed that it was the tenacity of people like Bigombe that had convinced him to accept parallel peace talks with the rebels. &quot;Otherwise I prefer to kill them,&quot; said Museveni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While pursuing the difficult task of pacifying the north, she had virtually no family life. Her husband lives abroad with their two children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was a lecturer in African literature at Sophia University in Tokyo, Japan, an occupation that nurtured her liberal outlook. She chaired the Afro- Arab women's club in Tokyo and later worked with the African Development Bank (ADB) in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her departure comes at a critical time when Ugandan rebels are acquiring apparent greater support from the regime in Khartoum which accuses Ugandan authorities of supporting the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) of John Garang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebels recently massacred more than 100 Sudanese refugees in a camp in northern Uganda. Authorities said it was clear the rebels were executing a mission on behalf of the Sudanese government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Anglican bishops from Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Sudan, Burundi and Zaire, condemned the July 13 and 14 massacre of Sudanese refugees in northern Uganda, terming the act &quot;satanic&quot;. The bishops were in Kampala to attend a Pre-Lambeth Conference in preparation for the World Anglican Lambeth Conference in Canterbury, England in 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bishop of Namirembe Diocese the Rt. Rev. Samuel Sekkade said it was now more necessary than ever for both sides in the northern Uganda conflict to seek a negotiated settlement to the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Anglican bishops' sentiments are shared by the Uganda Catholic Bishops Conference which has sent the head of the Ugandan Episcopal Conference Bishop Paul Kalanda of Fort Portal to the northern town of Gulu, to try and make initial contact with representatives of the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Kalanda is accompanied by two other bishops, the veteran Bishop Adrian Ddungu of Masaka Diocese and Bishop Erasmus Wandera of Soroti. Their stay in Gulu coincided with the July 13 massacre of more than 100 Sudanese refugees in the Acholi-Pii and Agago refugee camps in the neighbouring Kitgum District.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndiso Kinyumu, All Africa Press Service</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEWS, DOCUMENTS &amp; COMMENTARY</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1627 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Tell a fellow Kenyan man that you either worked in the Kajiado and Narok regions in the Rift Valley Province, areas mainly inhabited by the pastoral Maasai people, and the next most probable question will hinge on whether you liberally enjoyed the privileges accorded to a male visitor after the simple act of planting a spear outside the host's hut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is widely held that Maasai men lend wives to their &quot;visitor&quot; age- mates, thanks to shoddy anthropology and contradicting explanations from the Maasai themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrival of a male visitor in his agemate's homestead is announced by the planting of a spear outside the main hut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is said that the spear planted by the visitor, serves as a warning to the husband that another man is temporarily in control -- something akin to the &quot;not vacant&quot; sign seen on the door latch of public washrooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from these contestable allegations, the spear is seen as a symbol of Maasai military prowess. It is the standard weapon in the Maasai armoury and any warrior (moran) without one would be likened to a state without an army.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenyan history manuals teach that British imperialists failed to coerce the Maasai into ceding territory, because of the latter's military prowess.  Consequently, the colonizer was forced to negotiate for Maasai land that he got through fraudulent treaties entered into with illiterate Laibons (Chiefs- cum-spiritual leaders) who simply thumb-printed the communities' prime- grazing areas to the white settlers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from the Nandi who are somehow linguistic cousins to the Maasai, other Kenyan communities were simply pacified into surrendering huge chunks of land to the white settlers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the cultural and military significance of the spear, it is not surprising that a near-religious reverence is accorded to it. For instance, it would be unthinkable for a Maasai lady to arm herself with a spear. It is simply a warrior's weapon. Old men do not carry one with them, probably because of its weight--about seven kilogrammes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back to the issue of wife-lending: Joseph Miaron, a development worker with Group Ranchers Education Programme, a non-governmental organization (NGO) working among the Maasai people in Loitokitok, in the slopes of neighbouring Tanzania's Mt. Kilimanjaro, will not hear of this. He says; &quot;Like other men the world over, the Maasai guard their matrimonial beds jealously.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will have to be a mad society where you lend your wife to a stranger,&quot; he protests. Nevertheless, he agrees that Maasai did and still do accommodate strangers in their houses. He is however quick to clarify that, whereas such strangers are allowed to sleep in the same hut with the host's wife, decorum demands the appreciation of this hospitality. In this respect, the visitor is strictly expected to confine himself to the bed allocated to him while the host's wife must never sneak out of the matrimonial bed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But given human beings' propensity for mischief, &quot;why would anyone trust his wife with another man? It has to do with society responding to the dictates of the environmental realities of the harsh savanna which feature expanses of wildlife-infested, waterless and foodless tracts of land,&quot; explains Miaron. As such it would be morally irresponsible for any Maasai man to deny another accommodation, consigning him to suffer the vagaries of the savanna.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who maintain that the accommodation business is an exercise in moral laxity should know better. Age-old conventions are adhered to. Stranded strangers introduce themselves to manyatta (village) elders, specifying their clan which is an integral part of the Maasai social organisation, their age groups and other details to help the elders vet their sincerity, before allocating the visitor a place to spend the night in a hut that must belong to his age-mate in accordance to custom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once in the age-mates' hut, the visitor is properly fed before being offered a bed. Due to the preponderance of polygamy among the Maasai, the owner of the hut may opt to go and sleep in any of his other wives' huts as a show of respect for the visitor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This has given rise to the misconception that we share wives. It does not mean he has handed over the wife to the visitor,&quot; says bank clerk Robert Melly, 25, from Laikipia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happens when a man senses that the limits of his hospitality have been overstepped?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Moses Ole Mosiany resignedly maintains that there were and still are cases of mischief. &quot;To pre-empt the designs of the spouse and the visitor, a man can insist on sleeping on the same bed with the suspect,&quot; proposes Tikolo Ole Siriwo, aged over 60. &quot;Whatever precautions are taken, there is no way of knowing what goes on between your wife and the other man,&quot; admits Ole Murumbi, 57.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talking to senior Maasai citizens, one gets the impression that they are desperate about the wife sharing business. &quot;We normally have two beds -- one for visitors who must be your age-mates... We don't care if they (visitors) conspire with your wife...there is no point in guarding your women. It's impossible,&quot; believes Ole Nkobei who lives around Isinya, some 50 kilometers south of the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. &quot;This attitude perhaps is explained by the fact that the old men, unlike their sons grew up when the wife lending culture was rife among the Maasai,&quot; says a priest who, fearing that his views would alienate some of the new faithful in his church, requested anonymity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samperu Ole Tauo, is in his early 30s and a &quot;modern&quot; Maasai who has worked for several NGOs. &quot;I have stayed in a manyatta (traditional Maasai village made of huts set in a circular pattern) and I have witnessed the day to day life of the Maasai. If such immorality (wife sharing) takes place, it must be on a very small scale,&quot; he maintains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, it would appear the story has two sides. School teacher Viola Mayian, 22, agrees that some women are morally loose and misuse tradition for their own selfish needs. She however points out that the educated Maasai will not hear of such primitivity as wife sharing. &quot;You don't expect me to be lent out by my husband - I'll just quit the marriage,&quot; she retorts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one should not misconstrue the act of a visitor planting a spear outside his age-mate's hut to imply that the Maasai condone promiscuity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although little is said about the offending male, tradition demands that any wife who misuses her hospitality to entertain ...risks the not- too-soft walloping that is administered on wayward spouses. Apart from beatings, the offending woman is subjected to heavy fines (in the traditional sense) which may feature a calving cow produced by her maternal family. The blotch that goes with adultery notwithstanding, the idea of parting with a calving cow becomes very painful, given the high esteem in which the pastoral Maasai hold livestock. Indeed it is joked that Maasai greetings feature cattle, pasture and family in that order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maasai traditional law, it would seem, prescribes no specific punishment on spouses having affairs outside marriage. &quot;Punishment ranges from forfeiting livestock to being killed by the aggrieved party,&quot; says the priest, who earlier on requested anonymity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But does a spear planted outside a hut really indicate that the man of that house has ceded it to another? &quot;Spears are usually planted outside huts during the day because it is cumbersome to enter inside the low-roofed Maasai huts carrying one. They never serve as 'No Entry' signs,&quot; says Miaron.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also punctures more holes in the spear-as-sexual-licence talk by maintaining that &quot;since spears are normally carried by morans, the issue of old men using them for immoral purposes does not arise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morans usually move in groups and what one would find is a cluster but not a single spear, says Miaron. However, this sounds too perfect. Obviously there must be a time when a moran travels solo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To Miaron, the spear myth has been peddled by &quot;devilers and prostitutes of Maasai culture for monetary gains from the tourism circuit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They see us as a commodity that has to be marketed, packaged in what is normally referred to as state of nature...yes they want tourists to come and see the exotic aboriginal man,&quot; he fumes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - The alleviation of poverty and development of good leadership are issues likely to rank high on the African bishops agenda for the ten-yearly Lambeth Conference for Anglican Bishops scheduled for 1998. And the Lambeth Conference will be asked to lobby with governments of the North to &quot;forgive us our debts&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a pre-Lambeth meeting held recently in Kenya's coastal town of Mombasa, some 500 kilometres south-east of the capital, Nairobi, all 19 bishops of the Church of the Province of Kenya (CPK) agreed that the most important social issue for the African Church is poverty and a general feeling of marginalization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Joyce Karuri, a facilitator at the Mombasa meeting, observed that people behave desperately when they are in desperate conditions thus poverty has led to violence and family break-ups, and lack of concern for others. &quot; The poverty of developing nations affects humanity because there is no security, there is a lot of degradation of the environment, plots and school land end up being sold with no regard for the future,&quot; said Rev. Karuri who is also the Director of Communications in the CPK Diocese of Kirinyaga in the country's Eastern Province.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence, said Rt. Rev. Samson Mwaluda of the Diocese of Taita Taveta, Coast Province, is further perpetuated through the media and is likely to be worse here than in the North because of poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The solution to these was seen as two fold. It includes on the one level a realistic solution to the external debt crisis and fair trading, and on the other mobilization of better and honest leadership as well as conditions of service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poverty, the meeting heard, has pushed corruption to every plane of society, not excluding secular and church leaders. They use their positions to both grab and amass as security for the future. But with a better economic and welfare scheme to prepare leaders for retirement, the threat of an insecure future would be minimized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The church leaders observed that true democracy is needed in the church to ensure more transparency, but this should be exercised in collegiality and consultation with others, especially the pastoral care committee. Bishops should adopt a simple life-style, without destroying the credibility and integrity of a minister of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was perhaps the reality of the fragile unity in the church that stirred the most emotions. Still fresh with the memories of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, emphasis was put on the reconciliatory role of the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are divisions in the church based on class, race, tribe, land tenure etc. These need to be overcome through teaching about the sanctity of human life, emphasizing the doctrine of creation, human dignity and equality of all people made in the image of God,&quot; the first conference document says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CPK bishops also acknowledged the tremendous influence of mass media, violence through movies and screening of wars, all of which visit people right in their living rooms through television sets. Family members cannot even face one another in their homes without the stranger - the TV, to which very few positive values can be traced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, Lambeth will be asked to help lobby for production and screening of good movies that promote unity and positive values. But above all, the church needs to awaken from her stupor and set an agenda rather than react to what others have done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting that the church tends to be comfortable with most things and watches helplessly as young people are drawn to the devil, the Dean of the Province Rt. Rev. David Gitari said: &quot;We should point out the close connection between Christian and African initiation rites especially the sacraments of baptism and confirmation. We would like the body of Christ to be more committed to the Christian upbringing of children and initiation into Anglican thoughts and practice, so that they are not lured away into modern cults.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acceptance and recognition of homosexuals within the Anglican Communion is likely to be of major concern in the next Lambeth meeting. Fronted by the American Church which has already ordained a non-celibate homosexual to the diaconate, the move, unless strongly opposed, may be a first step in making the practice legally acceptable within the Communion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from the ordination of women, an issue that particularly sparked controversy in its early stages in 1982, homosexuality is the one issue which is likely to tear the Anglican Communion right down the middle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the Kenyan church leaders, homosexuality is yet to become a major issue for the local church. But the bishops nevertheless agreed to offer a scholarly response with understanding and sensitivity as to why it is not a problem in Kenya today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is important, they said, not to let the key issues of poverty and culture be hijacked by the homosexuality debate. But &quot;if the bishops of Kenya remain silent on the issue, they may fall behind on it because others are presenting aggressive views on it,&quot; said Dr. Robert Song, a facilitator from the University of Durham, United Kingdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Province of Kenya, with an Anglican following of some 3 million faithful does not have a woman bishop. However, the province has 40 ordained women priests among 19 bishops and 1,200 priests, serving in 22 dioceses countrywide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in Southern Africa, the Synod of Bishops met in February to consider the Lambeth Conference themes. They were joined by representatives of the Provinces of Central Africa and the Indian Ocean. They reflected on the recent period of great change within the province, especially in South Africa, Mozambique and Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Archbishop Desmond Tutu, emeritus bishop of Cape Town and former head of the Anglican Church in South Africa; &quot;The challenge of the church is to labour with God, to help God's children to become ever more fully human which is a glorious destiny.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular the Church needs to engage in the secular debate on how best moral and ethical foundations of society could be promoted. Added Tutu; &quot;It is the right of all baptized Christians to have access to a spirituality that will enable them to engage critically as Christians, both as individuals and as members of the community of faith, in these vital public issues.&quot; The issues include human rights, human sexuality, racism and the family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bishops highlighted the primary task of evangelism in their region.  Emphasis was put on the search for dynamic ministry. In this context there was clearly a greater role for the laity to play in order to &quot;free the ordained ministry to refocus its vocation.&quot; It was hoped that the region could offer some reflection on how to avoid the marginalisation of those without power and those with little hope. It seemed clear that this part of the African Church will be calling for the Lambeth Conference to give time for each region to give presentations of their life, culture and concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each province at the meeting will now prepare its own submission and covering report, focusing on the major areas of common concern which the regions would like to see on the Lambeth Conference agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Province of South-East Asia was inaugurated on February 2, 1996 at St. Andrews Cathedral in Singapore. It becomes the 37th province of the Anglican Communion worldwide. The new province comprises the four dioceses of Kuching, Sabah, Singapore and West Malaysia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev. Dr. George Carey, installed the Most Rev. Moses Tay as the first Archbishop of the new province, at a service at the St. Andrew's Cathedral, Singapore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Carey spoke of the long process which had led to the formation of the province: &quot;Many of us believe that this historic event is the fruit of much prayer, planning and agonizing discussion which has taken years to accomplish.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his sermon at the inauguration, Dr. Carey spoke of &quot;the difficulties encountered in setting up the province,&quot; and urged the four dioceses not to allow ethnic factors to divide them. The province's rich and diverse heritage was manifested in the service as portions of the Scriptures were read in Bahasa Malaysia, Tamil, and Mandarin, while the service itself was conducted in English.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the inauguration service, the Archbishop of Canterbury relinquished his metropolitical authority and presented the Deed of Relinquishment to the new Archbishop. Dr. Carey also handed the Primatial Cross to the Primate saying: &quot;Bishop Tay, I give you this Primatial Cross as a sign of the ministry we share with our Lord Jesus Christ. May His love be your inspiration, His suffering your example, and His humility your authority as Chief Shepherd of His Church in this place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new diocese brings together four very different dioceses and many more countries. The Diocese of Kuching is composed of two countries, Sarawak and Brunei Darussalam. The Diocese of Singapore unites Anglican churches in Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Singapore. The Dioceses of West Malaysia and Sabah also bring together different peoples, languages and cultures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canon John L. Peterson, Secretary General of the Anglican Communion, was present at the inauguration and afterwards said: &quot;The Anglican Communion looks forward to the strong support this new province can give fellow Anglicans world-wide, especially in crisis situations. The South East Asia resources are bountiful and could be of enormous help to less fortunate areas of the Communion where a strong Christian witness is needed. I welcome their new united presence in the family with open arms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lambeth Conference has since 1898 brought together all the bishops of the Anglican Communion to map out strategies for the churches' involvement every ten years. The Communion presently consists of 37 provinces each under an Archbishop. The head of the 70 million strong worldwide Anglican Communion, the Archbishop of Canterbury, is recognized as the primus inter pares - first among equals and is always the convener of the Lambeth Assembly.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bujumbura - The coup in Burundi on July 25 came despite warnings a day earlier by the United Nations Security Council, the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the European Community and other leading Western nations, that any attempt by the military to seize power from Ntibantunganya's government through illegal means or under any pretext would be resisted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Geneva, the World Council of Churches (WCC) linking 330 churches in 100 countries, appealed on July 25 for urgent action by the international community to prevent genocide in Burundi, as the United Nations decided at the same time to pull out non-essential staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But thhe Tutsi-led Burundian army moved in and installed former president Pierre Buyoya as Head of State, ousting Hutu president Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, the Defence Ministry announced on the national radio.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the tiny central African nation's army closed the country's borders and airports until further notice, the radio quoted Defence Minister Colonel Pirmin Sinzoyiheba saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national assembly, political parties and all political associations were also suspended until further notice, the radio said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 46-year-old Buyoya, a former Tutsi officer, previously grabbed power in a military coup in 1987 and served until June 1993 when he handed back peacefully after being defeated in the country first democratic elections by the late President Melchior Ndadaye, later killed in an abortive coup by the Tutsi-led army in October 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overthrow of Ntibantunganya, 40, had been brewing for several days with the collapse of a fragile power-sharing agreement between the rival ethnic groups aimed at preventing a Rwanda-style genocide in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main opposition party, the Unity for National Progress (UPRONA) had accused the Hutu president of high treason and announced that it was withdrawing its support for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ntibantuganya, who came to power in 1994, fled in fear for his life to the protection of the United States ambassador's residence on the night of July 23, after the mainly Tutsi-led opposition withdrew support for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rumours of a coup were high after UPRONA denounced a September 1994 government convention that is the basis of the country's institutions, providing a power-sharing agreement between the Hutus and minority Tutsis.  The accord, set up in an effort to avoid the genocide that left between 500, 000 and one million people dead in neighbouring Rwanda two years ago, had come under increasing pressure with the escalation of ethnic fighting in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 20 people have been reported killed in the latest wave of violence since the previous weekend slaughter of 330 Tutsis, mainly women and children, an attack blamed on Hutu rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October 1993, soldiers launched an abortive coup attempt and murdered Ndadaye, the country's first democratically-elected Hutu president, unleashing inter-ethnic blood-letting which claimed more than 50,000 lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the army had denied on July 25 that it was staging a coup, it made a veiled warning of military intervention in the country's political crisis, saying it &quot;recommended&quot; that politicians avoid creating a constitutional vacuum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several senior government ministers and Hutu party officials had also fled to Western embassies or neighbouring countries as political tensions escalated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 2,000 people marched through the streets of the capital of the tiny central African country on the morning of July 25 demanding Ntibantunganya's resignation, but he said in a radio interview there was &quot;no question&quot; of him stepping down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tutsi Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo, at loggerheads with Ntibantunganya, had also said that he was prepared to quit because of the &quot;collapse of the consensus built around the current president.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kampala - A two-day National Forum on Food Strategy which focused on food security in Uganda, has concluded that Uganda has the ability to feed itself and at the same time export a substantial amount of food to Eastern and Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The July 23 to 24 Forum on Food Strategy was organized by the Ministry of Planning and Economic Development. It was sponsored by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Participants included government officials, the private sector and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) among others.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Vietnamese born Dr. Nguyen Tuan, Senior Policy Adviser to the Export Policy Analysis Unit (EPAU) presented a paper in which he asserted that with proper planning, market identification and decimation by all concerned parties, including Uganda's impoverished small scale farmers in this East African country with a population of 17 million people can feed itself and its neighbours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is very possible,&quot; says Dr. Nguyen Tuan. The EPAU report emphasised that enhanced production of maize and beans, the regional staples, could reverse poverty on Uganda's small holding and in turn underpin general economic development in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Nguyen Tuan's presentation observed that with appropriate policies at all levels, Uganda could export one million metric tonnes of maize and beans by the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The export of one million tonnes of maize and beans could earn the country US $200 million and possibly overtake coffee as the main export crop. Unlike coffee, the prices of maize and beans would not be subjected to wide fluctuations which often hurt Uganda's small scale producers, because most times these prices are depressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already this year alone, Uganda is selling to Kenya more than $20 million worth of maize with more sales expected due to erratic rainfall in grain producing areas in Kenya's Rift Valley region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper by Dr. Nguyen Tuan advocated trade negotiation between Uganda and its neighbours to encourage them to purchase Uganda surpluses. Kenya alone imports hundreds of thousands of metric tonnes of maize from a variety of international producers annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The emphasis on proper market planning was accentuated as a pivotal factor to ensure that Uganda's hard working farmers do not undergo the experience they faced in 1988/89 when they produced too much maize for state-owned Produce Marketing Board. The result was that farmers were abandoned as huge amounts of food went to waste.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda's new Minister in Charge of Agriculture, also the country's Vice- President, Dr. Specioza Wandira Kazibwe has promised to carry out &quot;radical surgery&quot; in the next five years to ensure food security and poverty alleviation in the small holdings. Dr. Wandira was a surgeon by profession before she was appointed to the Cabinet in 1989.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme, to be launched in Kenya, will be aired weekly on the state- owned Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) radio. It is a joint venture between TWR and a German child care organisation, Kindernothilfe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mrs Pauline Ngunjiri, the TWR co-ordinator and Mr. Felix Kaloki, Kindernothilfe's project officer, the radio programme, expected to run for one year, will mainly focus on African children in difficult situations such as civil strife, diseases like HIV/AIDS and refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TWR is directly responsible for the actual direction and production of the programme while Kindernothilfe will provide financial support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngunjiri said the programme is special in that it draws attention to specific areas in the life of the African child. &quot;Otherwise we have general issues on children in our normal line-up&quot;, she explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official ceremony to mark the beginning of the TWR children's programme will take place at Gatima Primary School, Kawangware, some 20 kilometres from the city centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immediate past head of the (Anglican) Church of the Province of Kenya (CPK) Archbishop Manasses Kuria will deliver the key address at the function.  Since his retirement last year, the Archbishop has devoted his time and efforts to the work of street children through a children's home he established to meet the needs of such needy persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A press release announcing the launching of the new programme, says TWR hopes to mobilise children to tune in to the KBC Kiswahili service, network with non-governmental organisations in a bid to solicit relevant information from the ground and explain TWR's impact in Kenya and Africa as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TWR goes on air in 20 languages through programmes that are developed and produced by African Christians who live and work among their audiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The radio station, on air since 1974, has been beaming from short- wave (SM) and medium-wave (MW) transmitters situated in the southern African kingdom of Swaziland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Christian station broadcasts its programmes through seven national radio networks based in Kenya, Namibia, Botswana, Senegal, Benin, Zambia and Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nairobi network acts as the regional headquarters and studio, producing programmes for Swaziland and other centres.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maputo - The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) ended its largest repatriation and reintegration programme in African history on July 24, when it turned over to the Mozambican government more than 1,500 projects that will be incorporated in the country's long-term development plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sergio Vieira de Mello, UNHCR's Assistant High Commissioner, handed over 1, 571 projects worth $80 million in formal ceremonies attended by Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation Leonardo Simao</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and representatives of UN agencies and non-governmental organizations, says a UNHCR press release here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his remarks, Vieira de Mello praised the governments and people in Malawi, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Swaziland, South Africa and Tanzania for their generosity and hospitality towards the more than 1.7 million Mozambican refugees who sought asylum in the 1980s.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also congratulated this southern African country for the peace and stability it has achieved so far, and urged Mozambicans to continue to strive for development. He emphasized that the task of reintegration, rehabilitation and development is not yet complete and said UNHCR is committed to support Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the coming days, I will be visiting the Great Lakes region from where we receive on daily basis, images of horror and terror, very similar to those we used to receive from Mozambique before the general peace agreement. I will bring with me the incentive of peace in Mozambique as the best antidote for the despair brought about by the sombre situation in that region,&quot; Vieira de Mello said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR's integration projects included rehabilitation and construction of clinics, hospitals, schools and water facilities. The government and its bilateral UN and NGO partners are expected to continue support of the returnee areas as part of Mozambique's sustainable long-term development programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Food distribution to returnees, at its peak reaching more than 1 million beneficiaries, had been phased out by April 1996. UNHCR was also involved in the distribution of seeds and agricultural tools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The repatriation exercise started in 1993 following the signing of a peace accord on October 4, 1992 in Rome that ended 20 years of civil war in Mozambique. More than 1 million people lost their lives and up to 4 million were displaced internally during the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By October 1995, UNHCR had helped bring home by train, bus, ship and plane some 378,000 Mozambican refugees. Another 1.3 million refugees, mainly from Malawi returned spontaneously to their districts of origin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR has closed down most of its 20 field offices in Mozambique--a process that is expected to be completed by September. The UN agency will then maintain a small presence in the capital, Maputo, to handle refugees and asylum seekers in this country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Algiers - A new Islamic fundamentalist group has declared holy war on the Algerian government, amid growing evidence of internal dissidence within the four-year Islamic insurgency against the country's military-backed regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling itself the Islamic Movement for Spreading the Faith and Holy War (MIPJ), the new faction said in a statement issued here on July 22 that it had split from the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) and was declaring a new jihad, or holy war, against the regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hardline GIA, torn by internal divisions, has split into several factions apparently determined to outdo each other in acts of murderous violence against the Algerian government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement, whose authenticity could not be immediately confirmed, bore the signature of Mustapha Kertali, a former GIA &quot;emir&quot; in the Larba region, a fundamentalist stronghold south of Algiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The splits have been accompanied by a new escalation in the violence while Algeria's President Liamine Zeroual resumed consultations on July 15 with the opposition to try to find a way to end the civil war that has ravaged this north-west African country since 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his statement, Ketali said his group included GIA dissidents and former members of the Armed Islamic Movement (MEI) and the Islamic Front for Armed Holy War (FIDA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MIPJ appealed to all &quot;combatant sections&quot; to place themselves under its banner to consolidate forces and pursue the jihad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also announced its defiance of the GIA &quot;under whose banner the jihad has become illicit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armed Islamic extremists, including the GIA, have been fighting the military-backed Algiers authorities since the cancellation in January 1992 of legislative elections which the now-outlawed FIS was poised to win. Some 50, 000 people are estimated to have died in the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twelve people died and 14 were injured on July 20 when a bus carrying employees of a state-owned vehicle company was attacked at Keddara, 50 kilometres south-east of the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier on the same day, five people were killed and 30 injured when a bomb exploded in a cafe in Kilea, west of the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authenticity of the MIP statement which was sent to several news organizations, has not yet been verified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A week ago, a statement purportedly issued by the GIA, said it had ousted Djamel Zitouni as its head in a leadership purge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement said Zitouni, alias Abou Abderahmane Amine, who claimed responsibility for the murder of seven French Trappist monks in May, belonged to a faction that had been &quot;manipulated&quot; by the Algerian security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Official censorship on all matters relating to security makes it difficult to evaluate the true scale of recent violence, and newspapers, threatened with suspension, have generally not published reports on the killing of civilians.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abuja - The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has endorsed a proposal that envisions possible war crimes trials for Liberia's faction leaders, the head of the organization said here on July 23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That resolution presented this month by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) called for &quot;imposition of severe sanctions&quot; on the warlords, ECOWAS executive secretary Edouard Benjamin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sanctions should include &quot;the possibility of setting up a war crimes tribunal to try all those who have been involved in the violation of human rights of Liberians,&quot; he said in a report presented to a meeting of ECOWAS ministers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The perpetrators of the heinous crimes in Monrovia should not be allowed to continue any longer or go unpunished,&quot; said Benjamin, a Guinean national.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberian conflict was a key agenda item of a two-day ECOWAS summit which began here on July 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimated 150,000 people have died in Liberia since civil war broke out in December 1989. The faction leaders have signed around a dozen peace accords, the latest of them last August in Abuja, Nigeria, only to resume fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Faction leaders, especially those on the Liberian interim government, have made attempts to rewrite portions of the Abuja Peace Accord,&quot; Benjamin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the signature of that accord, the military aspects of it, especially disarmament and demobilisation, have remained &quot;largely unimplemented,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several pledges from international organizations last October during a United Nations conference on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia have gone unfulfilled while ECOWAS member states which pledged additional troops to an African peacekeeping force in Liberia have also failed to keep their word, Benjamin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But ECOWAS will continue to urge the international community to provide increased material and financial assistance to the peacekeeping force as well as humanitarian assistance to Liberian refugees in neighbouring countries and displaced persons in Liberia, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current total arrears of payment by ECOWAS members amount to $52.9 million, noted Benjamin adding that lack of adequate funding is hampering implementation of the community's programmes for Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ECOWAS decision comes amid reports that the United Nations and non- governmental aid groups lost $8.2 million worth of motor vehicles during looting that accompanied factional fighting in the Liberian capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a report released on July 22 in the Liberian capital, the UN humanitarian assistance office in Monrovia said 322 vehicles valued at US dollars 4,991,571 were stolen from the UN and its agencies during the looting spree in April and May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another 167 vehicles valued at $3,203,226 were stolen from international non-governmental organizations (NGOs).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is no secret that the majority of these vehicles are now in the hands of factional leaders and fighters, who despite concrete evidence and repeated appeals by the international community, refused to return them so that we can assist Liberians in need,&quot; the UN statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These vehicles are being used to further fuel factional aspirations and the war effort,&quot; it said, adding that only nine of the vehicles have been returned or recovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also looted at a significant cost, the UN said, were many basic humanitarian assistance items such as food and medicines, blankets, well- drilling equipment, chlorine to provide safe drinking water, plastic sheeting for shelter and seeds and tools for agricultural development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN release also complained of &quot;intangible loses of medical, logistical and administrative expertise and know-how which have diminished with the evacuation of the majority of international staff from Liberia during the crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cairo - A landmark conference gathering Muslim and Christian leaders from 90 countries opened here on July 24, with the aim of countering the Western image of Islam as a religion that preaches violence and intolerance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three-day conference was organised by the Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs and drew 150 delegates under the banner, Islam and the future of the dialogue between civilisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the Christian side, Pope Shenuda III, head of Egypt's Coptic community, attended along with representatives of churches in Egypt and the rest of the world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also said to be attending was a representative of the Vatican, the seat of the Roman Catholic Church, although his name was not given by organisers, as the Apostolic Nunciature of Cairo was not available for comment to confirm if the Holy See would participate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Islamic leaders were represented by the secretary general of the Organization of the Islamic Conference Hamed al-Ghabed, the sheikh of Al- Azhar, Egypt's highest Sunni Muslim authority, Mohamed Sayed Tantawi as well as the muftis, or religious leaders, of Bosnia and Jerusalem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference was taking place in a large Cairo hotel and mostly brought together religious affairs legislators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iraq, Sudan and Iran were not officially represented and no Jewish organization had been invited to participate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Political conditions don't allow it. When a total peace reigns between the Arab states and Israel, then conditions will be right to invite Jewish men of religion,&quot; said Egyptian Religious Affairs Minister Hamdi Zaqzuq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt was also among the guest speakers.  Addressing the press here a day before the conference opened, the Egyptian Religious Affairs Minister declared that &quot;this conference is a message to the world to show that Islam is a religion of tolerance calling for a peaceful co- existence between people and rejecting extremism and terrorism in all forms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egypt has for the past four years faced a violent campaign by Muslim militants demanding the institution of Islamic rule in the country, leaving more than 1,000 dead since 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference was set to end on July 27, the day before celebrations for the birthday of Mohammad, Islam's main prophet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want this conference to be a forum for dialogue and not for a fight between different ideologies,&quot; Zaqzuq emphasized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It &quot;will be an opportunity to present to Westerners the real principles of Islam. The judgement of Islam is always linked to extremism, violence and terrorism. It is automatically accused of any act of terrorism in the world before even those responsible are identified,&quot; observed the Religious Affairs Minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed out that Muslims were neither involved in the &quot;Oklahoma bombing, the incidents in the Tokyo metro not the assassination of (Israeli Prime Minister) Yitzhak Rabin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Terrorism is not exclusive to Islam, it is an international phenomenon, even if some who foment it claim to work in its name. On the contrary, Islam is often the victim of aggression,&quot; Zaqzuq argued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The world has witnessed over the past four years the genocide of Bosnian Muslims by the Serbs. Even though the perpetrators were Christians, no one spoke of Christian extremism. As Muslims, we refuse to follow this style and stick the label of extremism on to Christianity,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference, during which some 60 papers were presented, advocates that &quot; dialogue is the only possible future in this age where means of communication have broken down all barriers,&quot; Zaqzuq said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - The battle for survival and recognition of the Gay and Lesbian Association of Zimbabwe (GLAZ) is on, and this time they are set to prove a point with the approval of their application to exhibit literature at this year's Zimbabwe International Book Fair (ZIBF) which runs from July 26 to August 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GLAZ spokesman Mr. Keith Goddard, told APS that contrary to popular belief and official stance on homosexuality, more homosexuals from both races (black and whites) are coming forward to join the organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening last year's ZIBF, President Robert Mugabe took a swipe at the gays and lesbians who had booked a stand at the fair to educate the public on their sexual experience. He attacked GLAZ members who believed they had a constitutional right to exist, likening them to immoral people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I find it extremely outrageous and repugnant to my human conscience that such immoral and repulsive organisations, like those of homosexuals who offend both the law of nature and the morals of religious beliefs espoused by our society, should have any advocates in our midst and even elsewhere in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we accept homosexuality as a right as is being argued by the association of sodomists and sexual perverts, what moral fibre shall our society even have to deny organized drug addicts, or even those given to bestiality, the rights they might claim and allege they possess under the rubrics of individual freedom and human rights, including the freedom of the press to write, publish and publicize their literature on them?&quot; complained the Zimbabwean Head of State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following President Mugabe's, other organizations' and individuals' anger over homosexuality, flowers, instead of people were displayed at the empty stand in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this year, the story is a different one as the ZIBF trust has approved the GLAZ's application to exhibit books written to counsel sexually disturbed people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Trish Mbanga, the executive director of ZIBF, who nevertheless refused to comment on President Mugabe's position, confirmed that the homosexuals' association was scheduled to participate at the 1996 fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Their application has been approved. The trust has decided to accept their application. The book fair is governed by the censorship board and we abide by the laws of Zimbabwe. We are confident that there will be nothing offensive that will be displayed,&quot; said Mrs. Mbanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As far as we are concerned, we feel we have got to be there (at the fair) and our intentions are that people ought to know what we do and not what the newspapers have been saying that we would display pornographic material. We have been talking to some churches and they have admitted that they don't have the understanding but now they have started talking to us. Some churches are more sympathetic than others and women are more sympathetic than men generally,&quot; said Goddard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Goddard claimed more people including those in rural areas were joining the organization, he could not disclose the size of GLAZ. &quot;This is the figure that nobody knows in the world. People are threatened especially in this country, this is why they don't reveal it in public,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe is not the only country in the world where gays are causing problems. In Britain and America gay people have been at loggerheads with their respective authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in some parts of Europe, the situation is changing favourably towards homosexuals. Iceland recently became the latest European country to legalize homosexual marriages and the International Gay Pride Day has been formed in recognition of homosexuality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other countries are Denmark (1989), Norway (1993) and Sweden (1995). But in Zimbabwe, a row erupted soon after the Head of State expressed his sentiments on gays, with the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) Member of Parliament, Tirivanhu Mudariki, mobilising the youth to &quot; be vigilant&quot; and sniff out immorality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even non-constituent MP, Chief Makoni advocated for harsh punishment for homosexuals: &quot;All found practising this evil should have stiff punishment meted out if they are to stop the evil than to send the culprits to prison where they will do it more,&quot; said the MP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Church organizations went out of their way last year to show their support for the president's stance, with the Assemblies of God Africa Church taking to the streets to demonstrate against homosexuality. However nobody knows how the issue will be resolved although there are claims that some churches have established dialogue with gays and lesbians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe Council of Churches (ZCC), has said it will not stop any attempt by delegates to the 8th General Assembly of the World Council of Churches (WCC), to discuss among other things, homosexuality. The conference is scheduled to be held in Harare from September 6 to 23, 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1996 Zimbabwe International Book Fair which began last week, has attracted 250 exhibitors and is expected to bring 5,000 trade visitors to see the five tonnes of books on display.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - A new survey on population trends in Africa has painted mixed pictures of life in Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), Morocco and Central African Republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study conducted by the United States-based Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) says data from Cote d'Ivoire has revealed that although women in the country are now bearing less children than in the past, they still have to face the death of their offspring in the same proportion that they did 15 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the authors; &quot;The rise in child mortality observed over the recent years can be explained in part by deterioration of the country's economic situation which affects the most vulnerable groups of the population first.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DHS study says as soon as newborns stop being breastfed, they are exposed to the risks of under nutrition and infections directly related to the economic, sanitary and environmental conditions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is also possible that the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) epidemic has resulted in an increase in child mortality: either directly since some children died of the disease or indirectly because, at the household level, children faced a worsening of their living conditions,&quot; they added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key statistics provided by the country's Enquete Demographique et de Sante says, in 1987, for every 1000 infants aged one month, 41 died before reaching their first birthday. It also showed an increase in the post- neonatal mortality to a level of 47 per 1000. A similar situation was observed regarding child mortality; starting around 1982, for every 1000 children aged one, 57 would die before reaching their fifth birthday. Around 1987, the figure increased to 62 per 1000 and now stands at 67 per 1000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authors thus conclude that &quot;the high level of post-neonatal mortality may possibly be due to the fact that a vast majority of infants are not exclusively breastfed as recommended until the first four to six months of life.&quot; After this time the child is expected to gradually feed on solid foods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But mothers in Cote d'Ivoire introduce their infants to other types of liquids or even solid or mushy foods earlier than they should. &quot;These practices put infants at risks of contracting infectious diseases, particularly diarrhoea, for which they receive little, if any, treatment,&quot; say the authors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Morocco the DHS survey found that there has been a decline in fertility over the past three years. This, the authors of the survey say is due to the fact that there is an increase in the age of first marriage. At 15-19 years of age, nine out of ten women are still single and 60 per cent at 20-24.  Overall, 42 per cent of women 15-49 years are not married.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fertility decline in Morocco is also a result of the changes in the behaviour of couples towards family size. Among married women, 63 per cent declared wanting no more children. Furthermore, among the 43 per cent of women who declared wanting another child, 26 per cent would rather space their next birth by two or more years,&quot; the authors said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Central African Republic, the report describes the level of maternal mortality as &quot;very disturbing.&quot; There were 948 death of women from maternity related causes for every 100,000 births. In comparison, rates were 652 and 510 respectively in Niger and Senegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, &quot;the under-five mortality rate is high as there were 157 deaths of children under five for every 1,000 live births, or almost one in six children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, rates range from 77 per 1,000 in Zimbabwe, 126 per 1,000 in Cameroon, 187 per 1,000 in Burkina Faso to 318 per 1,000 in Niger, where a low vaccination coverage, under nutrition problems and a weak prenatal care coverage may partly explain this high level of under-five mortality.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington, DC - As Vice President Al Gore and South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki looked on, Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) President and CEO Ruth R. Harkin signed an investment fund protocol for a $120 million fund that will make equity investments in South Africa and other nations in Africa's southern region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This fund brings the first sizable pool of private capital to southern Africa dedicated to projects that offer new workplace opportunities for the region's black population,&quot; Mrs. Harkin said at Commission meetings held at the State Department earlier today. &quot;Experienced fund managers and a focused investment strategy will enable this fund to move quickly to capitalization, with sound investments following shortly.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Harkin signed the protocol with Mr. Maceo Sloan, Chairman of the Durham, North Carolina-based Sloan Financial Group, Inc. The Fund, called the New Africa Opportunity Fund, L.P., is managed by New Africa Advisers (NAA), a subsidiary of Sloan, and is backed with an OPIC investment guaranty. With managed assets of more than $3.5 billion, Sloan is the largest African- American owned investment firm in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The management team of NAA includes experienced investment professionals located in Johannesburg, South Africa supported by the Sloan organization in North Carolina. NAA was the first U.S. investment firm to locate an office in Johannesburg in 1992, providing American investors access to African securities markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fund, one of 23 OPIC-backed investment funds, will focus on the development of businesses which are owned by the region's majority population.  It is expected to increase the level of U.S. goods and services flowing to southern Africa and to generate significant regional economic development. In addition, the Fund will support the return to South Africa those American companies that left during the boycott period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am pleased to announce this fund during these important Gore-Mbeki Commission meetings,&quot; said Mrs. Harkin who is Vice Co-Chair of the Commission's Trade and Investment Committee. &quot;Investor reaction to historic events in the region have been very positive, and this OPIC-backed fund will make it possible to capitalize on the exciting new opportunities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to South Africa, the Fund will pursue investments in other southern African counntries including: Angola; Botswana; Lesotho; Malawi; Mozambique; Namibia; Swaziland; Zambia; and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All investments made by OPIC-backed funds are reviewed to ensure a positive impact on the U.S. economy and that the projects take steps to protect the host country's environment and respect worker rights. Since 1971, OPIC has supported $84 billion worth of investments that will generate $43 billion in U.S. exports and help to create and support 200,000 jobs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlanta - As Nigeria qualifies to the semi-finals Zambia's hopes for medals at the Atlanta Olympic Games dwindled to three after two more boxers were beaten on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only three athletes, 400 metres hurdler Sam Matete, Steeplechaser Godfrey Siamusiye and 5,000 metres specialist Frank Nkandu, remain in contention for medals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the boxers, Flyweight Borniface Mukuka lost 13-4 on points to Albert Pakeev of Russia while Light Welterweight Davis Mwale was outpunched by Bolat Niyazymbet of Kazakstan, 11-3 in the second round of their respective divisions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The left-handed Pakeev had Mukuka in trouble right from the start with his southpaw style and won easily. Mwale was in similar trouble with Niyazymbet although he tried to put a spirited fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matete, the top favourite was expected to take to the track at about midday on Monday while Siamusiye was expected to race in the 3,000 steepchase first round later in the evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the Games starting to recover from the explosion that rocked the Olympic Park on Saturday, track and field events took centre stage on Sunday with sensational Carl Lewis barely making it to the finals of the long jump, the only event he is taking part in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lewis' last leap was the best of the day, and sent an ominous warning to his competitors: Each time he has led after the qualifying round, he's won Olympic gold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A victory on Monday night would give Lewis his ninth gold medal and fourth straight in the long jump, tying him with discus thrower Al Oerter as the only Americans to win gold in four straight Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other closely watched American, Michael Johnson , jogged the final 30 metres in the 400 semifinals, easily winning his heat in 44.59 seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World-record holder Butch Reynolds failed to qualify for Monday's final when he fell with a hamstring injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In soccer, Brazil, which has never won an Olympic gold medal in men's soccer despite four World Cup titles, moved a step closer to ending that drought on Sunday. The Brazilians broke a 1-1 halftime stalemate to defeat Ghana, 4-2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazil advances to the semifinals on Wednesday where it will have a rematch with Nigeria, a team it defeated in Group D play, 1-0.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the other quarterfinal, Nigeria defeated Mexico 2-0 in a game in which Nigerian goalkeeper Joseph Osu made incredible diving stops. Augustine Okocha scored both goals for Nigeria.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">...London - Since coming to power in a coup d'etat in 1989, the National Islamic Front (NIF) regime in Khartoum has been barred from receiving United States economic development aid because, first, it overthrew a democratic government and, secondly, it became a sponsor of international terrorism.  That bar has applied to the whole of Sudan, even those areas under the control of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). Now, however, the situation is about to change thanks to a re-evaluation of the situation in Sudan by the US Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent amendment to the USAID Appropriation Bill for 1997 has exempted the SPLA controlled areas of the South, the Nuba Mountains and the Ingessina Hills, from the bar on US development aid. These areas will now receive direct USAID assistance for &quot;capacity building&quot;, for instance. Such funds that are made available will be directed through non-governmental organisations (NGOs) operating in the SPLA controlled areas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The congressional appropriations committee has made it clear that no aid will be made available to the areas under the control of military factions who have allied themselves with the NIF regime. Passed as part the 1997 US Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programmes Appropriations Bill on 29 May, the full text says:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Committee authorizes AID to use development and disaster assistance funds for capacity building purposes in areas of Southern Sudan outside the control of the government of Sudan. The committee strongly encourages AID to make funds from these accounts available to non-governmental organizations for this purpose. The committee expects that these funds will not be used in areas controlled by Southern factions that have and continue to cooperate with the government of Sudan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scope for Real Help</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passage of the bill does not necessarily mean that the needs of Southern Sudan will be fully met. While there are many US and foreign NGOs working in the SPLA controlled areas, some of these have not always seen their role as one of assisting the economic and social development of the South, but merely as delivering relief. Co-operation between the NGOs and the local communities has often been poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past there has been confusion between international and indigenous NGOs. Setting up an NGO in the South has often meant setting up an Arab faction alongside it. The USAID will now only go to areas outside of Khartoum's control and this should help avoid any future confusion. It should not be difficult for the USAID personnel to establish two basic criteria under which development aid will flow to the SPLA controlled areas. Firstly, territorial control will have to be fully established. That is crucial to the security of the NGO personnel in the field. Secondly, the people who will benefit from the aid need to be identified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Showing Leadership</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provision of USAID is an important step towards the future development of the war affected parts of Sudan. It may even become a catalyst in the search for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By passing this amendment to the aid bill, the United States Congress has once again shown itself as a leader of the world. This is not the first time the US Congress has led the way on matters concerning the situation in Sudan.  In October 1993, on the invitation of the then chairman of the House of Representatives Sub-committee on Africa, Congressman Harry Johnston, the leaders of Southern Sudan, Dr John Garang and Riek Machar, signed the historic document which unleashed the current political agenda on Self- determination. Mr. Johnston and another friend of Sudan, Congressman Frank Wolf of Virginia, were no doubt instrumental in the exemption of the SPLA controlled areas from the ban on US aid to Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While this publication welcomes the move to provide the SPLA controlled areas of the country with aid through the NGOs, we are concerned that some of this aid will also be provided to the UN agencies. We fear that the UN agencies have always acted only on the bidding of the Khartoum regime. They have, for instance, failed to deliver aid to the Nuba Mountains when they know there is a serious need there. We would urge the USAID to confine its aid to Southern Sudan to the NGOs only and to exclude the UN.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - In all the recent changes of government in Sudan from civilian to military and vice versa, the deterioration of the national economy and its direct effect on the lives of ordinary people has been the main spark for change. The decline in the national economy may yet prove to be the downfall of the current National Islamic Front (NIF) regime. Today the economy has not merely worsened, it has collapsed into a state of bankruptcy. Add the ongoing civil war in the South, another traditional cause of defeat for regimes in Khartoum, and the picture is truly bleak for the NIF regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NIF regime has been in charge of the national economy for seven years and has passed at least six annual budgets. It cannot escape responsibility for the economic crisis now facing the country. The regime passed its sixth annual budget in January this year. Six months on , that budget has fallen by the wayside due to chronic overspending and mismanagement of the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the sham elections in March, there is a new parliament and a new minister of finance. As a result, the condition of the national economy has been at the forefront of discussion. Even the regime's own statistics, which can hardly be relied upon, provide a frightening assessment of the economy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Basic Facts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Debate during May and June centred upon the State of the Nation address given by the newly elected president, Lieutenant General Omer Hassan El Beshir. In a reference to the economy, he stated that his regime would act to alleviate the economic hardship of the ordinary Sudanese citizen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The actions of his new minister of finance since taking office have had the opposite effect. Taxation has more than doubled and subsidies have been removed from many staple commmodities, without any regard to the incomes of the most vulnerable members of society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister's reforms were hurried through without recourse to discussion and debate in the parliament. There was plenty of consternation in NIF circles because of the discrepancy between El Beshir's address and the minister's actions. However, both El Beshir and the speaker of the parliament and NIF political mentor, Dr Hassan Abdulla El Turabi, have given their support to the new measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lieutenant General El Beshir said that the measures were necessary to preserve the economy and should be supported. He said that the measures would only adversely effect the lower one third of the population which could be remedied by other measures. He did not specify what these might be. El Beshir added that more than seventy percent of the population was wealthy enough to cushion the impact of the new measures. He was implying that the two thirds who live in the North could withstand the measures whilst the one third who live in the South did not matter! Despite the regime's claims to have created enough wealth in the North over the past seven years to make every individual wealthy, the truth of the matter is that select group of NIF supporters have been allowed to convert national assets into private wealth for their own benefit. The ordinary citizen is considerably worse off today than he was in June 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turabi Pledges Support</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part in the debate, Dr Hassan Abdalla El Turabi informed the members of parliament that they had neither the power nor the right to question the measures of the minister of finance. For the time being, he has had his way and has controlled the parliament as a speaker is meant to.  However, the hidden powers behind Constitutional Order Number Thirteen, which created the parliament and which was reportedly drafted by El Turabi and force upon El Beshir, allows the parliament to impeach the president and to question and sanction his ministers. In such an eventuality, the speaker of the parliament would succeed the president. Perhaps Dr El Turabi is reining in the power of the parliament at present, in expectation of a more opportune moment to exercise these hidden powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of parliament did discuss the minister of finance's statement and contrasted it with an earlier address of President El Beshir. Apparently, the minister of finance told the parliament that if the members wished to receive their salaries regularly, then fresh funds would have to be raised by the measures he is implementing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sudanese public has not proved to be as compliant as the parliament.  Many individuals are resisting the new measures by refusing to pay the additional taxes and boycotting certain goods in the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Types of Measures</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new economic measures include: new taxation; the curtailment of any new public expenditure; a freeze in on salary increases; and price rises on certain basic commodities. Sugar is to increase from L250 Sudanese pounds per kilogram to L500, for instance. That is the state controlled price at which citizens can buy their monthly ration of one kilo per family. The free market price has risen from L600 Sudanese pounds per kilogram to L980. Bread has increased from L50 per loaf to L80. Petrol has risen from L1,700 per litre to L2,500. Diesel fuel has gone up from L300 per litre to L1,200.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deficit Spending</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new measures are intended to check the deficit spending of the regime.  The state has been printing money without earning any income because there are no exports. State borrowing from the central bank is supposed to be regulated and controlled by law. Ceilings for borrowing are set at the time of the budget and should not be altered without due process. The budget in January set the ceiling at nine billion Sudanese pounds. By the beginning of May that figure had been overspent and fallen by the wayside. By the end of the year, it is expected that the borrowing will have risen to L300 billion.  In January, the total amount of money permitted to circulate in the economy was said to be L17 billion. By the end of May more than L600 billion had been printed by the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the measures outlined above, the regime has begun to attack its own system of political and constitutional decentralisation. The Islamic federal system has created over twenty-five regions and over sixty-five provinces. These political entities have no taxation powers of their own. All taxation powers will now be concentrated in the central ministry of finance.  The finances of all public institutions will also be operated from that ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Southern Sudan, where the regime must finance the ongoing war, the situation of state finances is desperate. The military has not been paid for months. The so-called popular support for the military, in the form of food and supplies, including trucks, could not be transported to the South because of the lack of fuel. There is an undeclared mutiny among the regime's troops in the South. Most have been in Southern Sudan for at least five years when they were promised only six months' tour of duty. They no longer want to fight and are asking to be returned to the North. The regime has no troop replacements for them and even if there were troops, the logistics for transport and supplying them is a real nightmare for the regime. But above all, there are the financial problems and the NIF regime has all but declared itself totally bankrupt.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banjul - In a move to bolster bilateral commercial ties, The Gambia is seeking cooperation from Saudi Arabia especially in the agricultural and natural resources sectors with a comprehensive package of proposals discussed with the officials of the Riyadh Chamber of Commerce and Industry (RCCI) in Riyadh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RCCI Agriculture Committee headed by Shihab Al Suweilem discussed the proposals. The talks will pave the future course of cooperation between the Kingdom and The Gambia. The Gambian side was led by the Gambian Ambassador Baba A. Drammeh.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to the growing bilateral relations between the two countries, Ambassador Drammeh pointed out that the Jeddah-based Islamic Development Bank (IDB) has recently extended financial assistance of $3.5 million to set up four schools in his country. The envoy said that several infrastructure projects worth millions of dollars had been submitted to the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD). These projects include building a university in Banjul, setting up an international conference facility and building road networks in the rural areas as well as in the coastal areas. Referring to short and medium-term prospects for Saudi investors in the Gambian agricultural and natural resources sectors, Ambassador Drammeh pointed out that his country provides added incentives to foreign investors including profit repatriation, allocation of land, availability of foreign exchange, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several areas of potential investment for Saudi and Gulf nationals include fisheries, livestock production, forestry, wildlife and tourism. The horticulture in The Gambia is favored with abundant underground water reserves, fertile land, relatively low labour costs and proximity to Western markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the question of the conditions of Gambian Muslims, Drammeh lauded the role of Arab world saying that a massive mosque built at government cost was inaugurated by the Imam and Khateeb of the Haram Mosque in Makkah, Sheikh Saleh Humeid, recently.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlanta - Commonwealth and Zambia 400 metres hurdles Champion Samuel Matete blazed through to the semifinals of the Olympic Games with a sensational run yesterday ( Monday) at Atlanta's Olympic Stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wearing an all black outfit with the Zambian colours across his chest, Matete won his race in 48.23 seconds, the best 400 metre hurdles time so far at this year's Olympics.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former world champion showed how well prepared he is right from the starting blocks, gliding easily over the first two hurdles. Matete was so smooth that he did not miss a single step as he began his quest for the only title he has not won.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matete failed to win a medal at the Barcelona Olympic Games in 1992 after he was disqualified on a controversial call, alleging that he knocked his hurdles onto the path of another runner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time it was ballet on track as Matete was perfect, barely touching the ground, let alone the hurdles. He looked focused and well placed throughout the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although known more as a powerful finisher than a powerful starter, Matete took charge of the race right from the begining, slowing down a little bit around the 200 metres leg but kicking up speed on the home stretch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is just one race, I have two more to run before I can celebrate,&quot; Matete , who stands as Zambia's major Gold medal hopeful, said after the race as the more than 80,000 spectators cheered him on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matete's semifinal race is set for tomorrow at 7 p.m. (U.S.time ) when he faces his greatest rival, American Derrick Adkins who also qualified for the 400 metre hurdles semifinal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlanta - Centennial Olympic park, Atlanta's Olympic fans' land mark where two people died after a pipe bomb blast on Saturday morning opened to the public on Tuesday morning with tens of thousands of faithful fans attending the memorial service which was conducted by Co-Chairman of the Atlanta Committee for Olympic Games(ACOG) Andrew Young.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid increased tight security which included hand searching of bags and added electronic surveillance, the fans paid homage to the deceased in a moving sermon which was punctuated with hymns as the fans bowed their heads in memory of the two lives lost when disaster struck the park built specifically to celebrate the games. Nita Whitaker and Georgia mass choir also performed the &quot;power of the dream&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fans, who had to wait for three agonising days for the park to reopen following its closure on Saturday morning were in full swing, once again rushing into the water fountain of rings to &quot;annoint themselves with the renewal spirit&quot; and possibly cool themselves down as they awaited the park's momentum to return to full speed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost all the fans interviewed maintained that they had no misgivings about returning to the park, adding that the increased security measures did not affect their free movement in the park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is one place in the town of Atlanta where one can unwind after a hectic day watching the games. It is such a wonderful place and it would have been a shame to miss it just like that. Iam glad it is open again&quot;said one fan from Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After trumpeter Wynton Marsalis performed &quot;just a closer walk with thee&quot;, Billy Payne, ACOG president addressed the crowd. He later declared the park open as the fountain of Rings were turned on much to the amusement of the fans who broke out into a thunderous applause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In attendance was the IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch and other celebrities including US Olympian Janet Evans. The families of the victims were all seated in the front rows and the fans held a moment of silence breaking out into the funfare which they had missed for three days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The entertainment programme saw famous Ladysmith Black Mambazo taking the At&amp;t stage first with Angelique Kidjo coming on at 13.00 hours local time.The mood in the park was that of contentment,as all revellers mingled and moved freely in a place which was envisioned as a central gathering area for the thousands of visitors expected to come to the city during the summer of 1996, and later for future generations to enjoy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the same park whose place in the history of the Olympic games was assured, though in a very sad manner , when a misguided person placed a pipe bomb which went off when almost 50,000 people were enjoying themselves, killing two and injuring 110 others. FBI investigations into the blast are still continuing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NOTE: Charles Katongo, a reporter for the Zambia Daily Mail, is participating in the International Journalists Coverage Program, sponsored by The Freedom Forum and the International Olympic Committee.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of shares traded improved to 1.9 million from 1.7 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NSE index lost 14.11 points to close at 3134.99. The plantations sector moved 100,000 shares, representing 5 percent of the week's traded volume.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">REA vipingo traded 88,000 shares at between 11.20 and 11.80 shillings.  Kapchorua dealt 5,500 shares at 65 shilings cum dividend down from 116 shillings the previous week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commercial and services sector traded 400,000 shares which accounted for 21 percent of the week's volume. Kenya Airways traded 331,000 shares at between 11.20 and 12 shillings. Nation Printers and Publishers stabled at 101 shillings after trading 31,000 shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The financial sector traded 1.2 million shares which represented 57 percent of the week's trading. The National Bank of Kenya moved 458,000 shares at prices fluctuating at between 15.20 and 16.50 shillings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The housing finance company of Kenya moved 213,000 shares traded at between 24 and 26.50 shillings, while the Barclays Bank rose to 121 shillings from 112, but slipped to 110 shillings by the close of the business on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Kenya government has gazetted a new Central Bank bill that seeks to give the bank's governor security of tenure and at the same time limit government borrowing from the financial institution in order to curb inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Central Bank of Kenya amendment bill 1996, to be tabled in parliament, proposes substantial amendments to the bank to ensure that it effectively controls expansion in money supply thereby containing inflationary pressures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill will also limit net credit to the government from the bank to 5 percent of the level of ordinary revenue in the latest audited accounts of the governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed amendments seek to empower the bank to, among others, formulate and implement foreign exchange policy, hold and manage its foreign exchange reserves, licence and supervise authorised dealers, and promote the smooth operation of payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill also restricts the period all directors, including the governor and deputy governor, can serve in the board to only two terms, while retaining each term at four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These changes, which are in line with the economic reforms for the 1996- 1998 period, are meant to give the bank more independence in managing monetary policy and to pursue an appropriate monetary policy at all times in order to ensure general price levels remain stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To enhance accountability, the bill proposes that the Central Bank submits monetary policy statements every six months to the government, containing a review and assessment of the implementation of the monetary policies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Oil company shares rallied back to the top on the Nigerian stock exchange last week after about a month of lethargy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investors' interest in them soared on the impressive full year trading result of one leading oil marketer, while others advanced on investors positive sentiment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African Petroleum posted an impressive result for the year ended Dec. 31, 1995, lifting its share to 28.03 naira, a 1.33 naira gain (1 U.S. dollar = 81 naira).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sector had been dull for some weeks due to the lower than expected quarterly results announced which sent investors looking to other sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One analyst said investors were returning after soaking in the effect of the oil company results and realising that the falling profitability was temporary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is only a matter of time before oil firms return to the top,&quot; a stockbroker told PANA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Losses were recorded mainly by the brewing concerns as well as Nigerian Tobacco Company whose performances have fallen below par recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, food shares remained strongly in demand, seeing Nigerian Bottling Company, Cadbury, the flour millers and Union Dicon salt appreciating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The all-share index which opened at 5,843.99 rose in the week by 59.31 points to 5,878.44. This compares with 24.86 points in the preceding week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LANGKAWI, Malaysia (PANA) - Malaysian airlines will introduce a flight service between Harare and Kuala Lumpur before the end of this year, following an agreement reached between the two countries last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe's minister of transport and energy, Simon Khaya Moyo said in an interview in Malaysia on Monday that air services between Zimbabwe and Malaysia would be economically beneficial to both countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moyo said during his week-long visit to Kuala Lumpur, he agreed with his Malaysian counterpart, Ling Sik, to let the two countries airlines establish flight services between them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have finalised the agreement between the two countries, and the Malaysian airline will be the first to introduce air services. At a later date Zimbabwe will reciprocate,&quot; Moyo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He expressed confidence that the air route to Kuala Lumpur would be viable for Zimbabwe, as it would be used by tourists from the Asian country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moyo, who came to Malaysia to participate in the Air Services Exhibition attended by 17 countries and 110 aviation companies, said the government would move fast on the construction of a new airport to enable the country to cope with the anticipated increase in tourist arrivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the importance of the new airport to the Zimbabwean economy, Moyo said he visited Malaysia's second 3.05-billion-dollar airport under construction to learn from them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) - A lion collapsed and died in a Khartoum zoo just as it was about to devour its daily breakfast of veal meat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The director of the zoo's natural history museum, Dr al-ajiba al Haj Ali told the official newspaper, al-Sudan al Hadeith (Modern Sudan) Tuesday that a group of veterinarians who inspected the liver of the dead lion established that its death was caused by viral jaundice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of the lion called &quot;Lu'Lu'a&quot; (pearl in Arabic) was &quot;not only a loss for the visitors or the zoo, it is a loss for the workers who treated it as one of their family,&quot; the Sudanese official said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lion was placed in the zoo after it was confiscated from a western relief official living in a luxurious residential area in Khartoum. The relief worker apparently brought it from game-rich southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unidentified relief official used to keep a lion and a lionness but the female was electrocuted on a rainy day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the death of its partner, Lu'Lu'a used to sleep beside its owner until neighbors complained of the presence of a lion. The animal was then confiscated and placed in the Khartoum zoo last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khartoum zoo was created during British colonial rule (1900-1956). It served as a transit point for wild animals destined for Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sanctuary was located in the Mogran area in central Khartoum overlooking the Blue Nile and a few meters from the convergence point with the White Nile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the current government of Gen. Omar el Bashir decided to dismantle the zoo and distribute the animals to the various states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the big animals, particulary the rhinos, giraffes and elephants were moved to a new zoo erected a few blocks to the south-west of the old one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government wanted to use the commercially attractive area, that used to be occupied by the zoo, for the construction of an international hotel and supermarkets. The move was also meant to ease pressure on the area, which is frequented by hundreds of families each holiday and causing traffic jams and sometimes incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, a few months after the animals were transfered to a poorly vegetated zoo, elephants and monkeys died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lu'lu'a was the last in the list of animals that have been dying at Khartoum's new zoo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, even in his death, Lu'lu'a remains useful. His body will be mumified, filled with hay and school children will come to learn something about natural history and animals.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - The trial of 71 senior officials who served under former Ethiopian dictator, Mengistu Haile Mariam, was Tuesday adjourned for two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court hearing the case of the officials, accused of murder and crimes against humanity, will resume Oct. 1, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the case was adjourned, a former inmate related a horror story about the callousness and cruelty of the Mengistu's military regime, also known as &quot; Derg&quot;, during the &quot;Red Terror&quot; campaign, which it unleashed against its perceived enemies between 1976-77.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the court how 16 fellow immates heard their names broadcast over the state radio early one morning in October 1976, as having been &quot;executed&quot; for anti-revolutionary activities. They were summoned about 15 minutes later to be taken away by armed soldiers for the &quot;real&quot; execution elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alemneh Gessesse, 47, formerly a labour organiser, said he was thrown into jail after he was accused of opposing the Derg and advocating for a democratically elected government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was testifying before the central high court of Addis Ababa in the case of 71 former members of the Derg on charges of genocide and crimes aganist humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-five of them are being tried in abstentia, including Mengistu Haile Mariam, who now lives in exile in Zimbabwe in May 1991, a few days before the collapse of his regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 46 defendats appearing before the court have all pleaded not guilty to the charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, which carry the death sentence under the 1957 Ethiopian penal code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gessesse further related three incidents between October 1976 and May 1977 at which he saw numerous prisoners taken, never to return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Red Terror&quot; campaign was believed to have been launched in Addis Ababa in October 1976 after the first attempt on the life of Mengistu. The Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Party was blamed for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three other witnesses also testified Tuesday explaining to the court how their close relatives were arrested by armed men at night and had their homes searched, apparently for anti-Derg pamphlets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To this day, the witnesses said, they never learned what had happened to their loved ones or why they were arrested.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American aid agency has confirmed that, while slashing programs elsewhere in Southern Africa, it remains ready assist South Africa in overcoming the educational crisis it is facing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new peace corps director in South Africa, Earl Yates, confirmed that the volunteers will offer training to teachers and administrators at primary schools in certain rural areas where the problem is most severe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should this program prove successful, another team of 30 volunteers would be sent to South Africa in October next year, said Yates. Operations would then be expanded to include training in health and environmental issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States has channelled 600 million dollars in aid into South Africa since the historic April 1994 elections, making it the top sub-Saharan recipient of American aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is generally attributed to American enthusiasm for a successful South African transition from minority rule to rule democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American peace corps has a budget of 218 million U.S dollars this year.  It has more than 600 volunteers operating in such African countries as Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, this figure is expected to drop to about 400 when the peace corps withdraws from Botswana later this year, and from Swaziland in 1998.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Former national team assistant trainer Jones Chilengi has warned the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) against falling to the idea of recalling veteran trainer Fred Mwila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chilengi, who now coaches Zimbabwe premier side, Hwange United, insisted that he was personally against the coming back of Mwila and veteran Profund Warriors coach Boniface Simutowe because of their bad relations with national team players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Having worked with both Mwila and Simutowe, I don't think this is the right time to call them to the national team because none of the players like them and if the coaches are not liked by players, how can we expect a team to win,&quot; observed the former Zamsure coach, who however described Mwila and Simutowe as being among the best in Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Chilengi, Zambia failed to win the Africa Cup because of the same problems where FAZ officials decided to recall Simutowe and City of Lusaka's Fred Nasilele who were not in good terms with other members of the team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had our best chance of winning the Africa Cup but because some people wanted to show they were in big positions, they messed up things by taking Simutowe to the team when they knew most players were not free with him, we must now learn from the past and achieve a double qualification,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, FAZ officials announced they will round up all Zambian coaches based outside and those within to help in the preparations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if he would consider coming back to assist the national team, Chilengi said he could not make it as he was still under contract with the Zimbabwe's Hwange Untied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zambia will always remain my country but as at now, I am still on contract and as such I can not come back to work here. But still I feel very strongly on the Zambian national team,&quot; said the coach in an interview at Woodlands Stadium last Sunday when he came for a short stay in the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The money needed for roofing is between K40 million and K50 million. The members felt the new wing was too costly as such it was better to build a mortuary to alleviate problems for the people in the area immediately and most members felt people had fifficulties in transporting corpses to and from Nchanga North Hospital mortuary nd onwards to the cemetery.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Direct communication at an interpersonal level among defence commanders within the Southern African region is an inevitable pre-requisite to regional peace and stability, Zambia Army commander, Lt-General Nobby Simbeye has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was speaking at the official opening of the second operations Sub-sub Committee five days conference of the Interstate Defence and Security Committee (ISDSC) held at Inter-continental Hotel in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Simbeye noted that attendance of regional meetings at Sub-sub Committee level had tremendously improved. He also hailed defence forces in the region for their commitment and involvement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a positive development which has demonstrated the commitment by defence forces in the region which is a pre-requisite to peace and stability.&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The purpose of the meeting attended by eleven member states, except Tanzania, was to co-ordinate, compile, approve and finally adopt the reports from the various Sub-sub committees for presentation to the defence chiefs at a date yet to be decided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairman of the Conference, Major-General Gibson Kamanga from the Malawi Army was thrilled with the spirit of co-operation and excellent response exibited by ISDSC member states who attended the meeting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amoung the recommendations and resolutions made prominent was the need for a mechanism for combating action against coup plotters. General Simbeye urged the participants to come up with practical solutions on the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other such areas of concern include the establishment of a satellite telecommunications system, inauguration of the regional committee for disaster preparedness, management and resoultions of regional conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Simbeye also urged the meeting to consider the establishment of a combined operations command centre where command and communication control, intellegence, information and planning will be carried out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also emphasised that bilateral and multilateral agreements are necessary for success in times of sudden disaster.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Generals from southern African states have been meeting in Lusaka this week to co-ordinate and investigate Interstate Defence and Security Committee (ISDSC) involvement into areas of concern in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ISDSC conference is being attended by South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Namibia, Swaziland, Lesotho, Zimbabwe and Zambia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only member state not attending is Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welcoming participants to the conference ISDSC operations sub-committee chairman, Major General G. R. Mautanga of Malawi, said among the specific issues the meeting is looking at is that ISDSC recommends a system for the establishment of a mechanism for action against coup plotters in member states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And speaking at the same function Zambia Army commander, Lieutenant General Nobby Simbeye, said the meeting should work out what each member state can contribute individually and what resources may be pulled together through ISDSC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was essential for the region to have disaster relief mechanisms in order to effectively and quickly respond to disaster strikes,&quot; Lt. Gen.  Simbeye said. &quot;It is therefore prudent to think about establishing a combined operations centre where command and control communications, intelligence, information, logistics and contingency planning can be coordinated and executed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maj. Gen. Mautanga said the conference was a preparatory meeting for the defence chiefs meeting to be held in September this year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlanta - On the night that Carl Lewis made what may be his farewell Olympic appearance and he took one gold medal with him, Zambia's own Godfrey Siamusiye began his chase for an Olympic medal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Running in the first round of the men's 3,000 steeplechase, Siamusiye clocked 8:30.56 to win second position and a berth in the semifinals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on the same day that 400 metres hurdler Samuel Matete qualified to the semifinals, Siamusiye showed why he may be the next best thing to come out of Zambia in track and field by giving veteran Kenya runner Joseph Keter an interesting race. Keter won the race in 8:30.23.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other top qualifiers in the steeplechase include Abdelaziz Sahere of Morocco, Matthew Birir and Moses Kiptanui both of Kenya and Italian Angelo Carosi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Matete and Siamusiye are expected to run in the semifinals tonight are likely to make it to the finals of their respective events if their performances on Monday were a correct gauge of their determination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Olympic story on Monday night belonged to Carl Lewis who reached the pinnacle of his career, tying an Olympic record by grabbing the gold in the same event for four consecutive Summer Games. The victory brought his Olympic gold medal total to nine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lewis shared the spotlight at Olympic Stadium with two Johnsons Michael in the 400 metres and Allen in the 100 metre hurdles -- who both set Olympic records while winning gold medals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Johnson moved one step closer to a historic Olympic double when he ran away from the field to win the 400 in 43.49 seconds. That broke the old mark of 43.50 set by Quincy Watts in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now he points toward the 200 metre competition today. He set a world record of 19.66 seconds in that race last month in winning the US trials, but then lost to Frankie Fredericks of Namibia in a race earlier this month. No one has ever won the 200 and 400 in the same Summer Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allen Johnson added a gold medal to the world title he captured last year by winning the 100 meter hurdles in an Olympic record 12.95 seconds. He broke Roger Kingdom's mark of 12.98.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Monday was also a good night for African runners as Ethopian Haile Gebrselassie led a pride of African runners to win the men's 10,000 metres Olympic gold. The 23-year-old Ethiopian surprised world cross country champion Paul Tergat of Kenya to win with Morocco's Salah Hissou coming in third.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the second gold of the Games for Ethiopia after Fatuma Roba's win in Sunday's women's marathon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African was also awashed with two surprise bronze medals and bitter disappointment for Maria Mutola of Mozambique in the women's 800 metres final.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutola, recovering from a heavy cold, won a bronze in her race for Mozambique's historic first Olympic medal but it was an upset defeat for the 23-year-old who had dominated the event for the last three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda's Davis Kamoga, who only took up running seriously two years ago, finished third behind American Michael Johnson in the men's 400 metres final for Uganda's second medal in Olympic history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian Falilat Ogunkoya, 26, took bronze in the women's 400 metres final, overshadowed by an Olympic record set by Marie-Jose Perec of France. Ogunkoya set an African record of 49.10 seconds in gaining her bronze, the first medal of the Games for Nigeria.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Eight opposition party leaders have urged the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to emulate the donor community which has condemned the re-emergence of dictatorship in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders who met in Lusaka on Monday night, resolved to send a three man delegation to SADC states to reinforce their call for tougher action against the MMD government in view of the recent constitutional amendments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a joint communique released by Liberal Progressive Front (LPF) chairman Roger Chongwe yesterday, they described the current political situation as &quot; explosive&quot;, adding that intervention from the SADC countries was needed to diffuse the tension.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The presidents expressed the belief that the member states of SADC should be seen to be in the forefront in promoting democracy and democratic practices in the region,&quot; Chongwe said. &quot;They should not be seen to be taking a second place to that taken by the international donor community which has shown its strong support for and condemnation of the dictatorship that has been created in the country by the legislative measures enacted by the MMD government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They reminded SADC countries of the role Zambia played and sacrifices it made in the liberation of the sub-region and said they expected a reciprocal gesture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The presidents therefore expected the SADC leadership to stand by the Zambians in their effort in rejecting anarchy and fascism which is taking root and branch,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition welcomed recent calls by government leaders, including vice- president Godfrey Miyanda, for the resumption of inter-party talks but said this should be put in writing indicating when the talks should occur. However, they reiterated that for the talks to succeed they should be chaired by a neutral chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They criticised the government for continuing to hold by-elections so close to the elections saying this was a ploy to divide the opposition. To counter this, they pledged to work closely in future elections and possibly form and electoral pact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They reiterated their earlier call on the government to allow voters to use their national registration cards in the coming elections in view of chaotic registrations exercise done by Nikuv Computers which has resulted in many errors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNIP was represented by party president Kenneth Kaunda, the National Party by vice-president Daniel Lisulo and the Zambia Democratic Congress by deputy general secretary Azwell Banda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other parties in attendance were the National Democratic Party, National Salvation Party, Grass Roots Welfare Party and the Revolutionary Socialist Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SADC countries have a security organ amongst whose objectives is the maintenance of regional security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe in Maputo on Wednesday said SADC countries have a right to advise each other using the organs if they see signs of danger in their neighbours.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Caledonia Mining Corporation, currently carrying out mining explorations in the country has announced a second significant cobalt discovery in Chililabombwe's Nama area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a Reuters report from Toronto last Sunday, the Canadian mining conglomerate announced the discovery in the geochemical anomoly C area located 11 km northwest of the original Nama discovery area.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report revealed that of the 23 drill holes the company had made, 20 had encountered cobalt mineralisation, with 12 holes intersecting significant cobalt values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Holes 80 and 81, located 250 metres apart, both ended in mineralisation with intersections of 94 and 59 metres respectively, and hole 76 intersected 0.041 per cent cobalt and 0.102 per cent copper over 21 meters,&quot; the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent leach tests carried out on hole 80 gave cobalt recoveries of about 40 per cent, giving rise to plans of further drilling in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in May, Caledonia Mining Corporation chairman, Dannis Mcleod, announced in Lusaka their first major discovery of a 2.5km long by 350 metres copper anomoly in Ndola rural's Kadola area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company further discovered 3 (three) kilometres long by 700 metres of nickel, cobalt and copper anomoly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the holes drilled for mineral prospects were at a depth of 10,000 metres.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Pressure will be on American Derrick Adkins as he faces Zambia and former World 400 metres hurdles champion, Samuel Matete, in the Atlanta Olymics semi finals tonight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for the Golden boy Matete, it will be an event he will use to confirm to the rest of the world that he is in a class of his own-what with his 48.23 seconds finish in the first round race on Monday!</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone in America is taking of Matete as the champion in the 400m, he actually stands as the best so far and we are just waiting for tomorrow (today) to see if he can live to his reputation,&quot; said Maidstone Mulenga, a Post Correspondent in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While everyone looks at the Zambian as the champion, fears are emerging that he may be affected by too much talk of him as the Olympic champion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matete stunned the world in 1991 when he clocked a record 47:08.91 to finish first in the world 400m hurdles meet in Japan and since then he has not looked back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as for now, he will have to work really hard to inform the world that the world 400m hurdles record of 46:78 secs, the Olympics record of 47:19 secs and the All Africa Games record of 48:03 secs, a record he actually broke in 1991!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which is why everyone in Africa is looking to the Golden boy, Matete to redeem Africa what with the failure of Mozambique's wondergirl, Maria Mutola who on Monday settled for a bronze medal in the 800m women race!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlanta - It is again happening as it has been the case in the past many years that the name of this beautiful Kingdom of Swaziland is stained before the number of countries participating in the Olympic Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One is left wondering what the country did to deserve such a disgusting humiliation in the world of sports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swaziland has never held any dignity since the Olympic Games began to be in place in the past centuries and it looks like, the country's performance will continue to be so bad until- nobody knows when. In the current Olympic Games being held in Atlanta, Georgia, Swaziland is a shame to most. But to other competitors, it is a blessing to have Swaziland because some athletes would be finishing last instead of last but one because they would have no one to outpace when the Swazi athletes are not there.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swaziland has, this year, performed badly than ever, failing to impress in all the activities her athletes have participated in so far. Up to this moment of the Atlanta Olympic Games, the six-men Swazi team has had four of its members knocked out and there are only two remaining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Awaiting to participate in the marathon this coming Sunday is Isaac Simelane and Tornado Sibandze while the rest of the Swazi athletes did not just fail to make the grade but were humiliated out of the games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is an indisputable fact that most of the 196 countries taking part in this year's Olympic Games have an ultimate goal of winning medals yet with Swaziland it is mostly not the case. Considering a number of factors, the main being the lack of facilities, Swaziland cannot, at this stage, expect to land in any of the medal-winning positions in such big games but that does not mean the country can not do better than at present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It does not mean Swaziland is not capable of winning medals but chances for that are very slim. The best the country can achieve is to compete satisfactory and show signs of improvement each time it participates in such games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what boggles the mind most is that when going through Swaziland's Olympic history, there seems to be no improvement and a future glare also signals that never will there be any.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just now we complain that the country is being let down by the poor performance being recorded in every Olympic Games. Since it is clear that we are still far from mining any medals, why is there no improvement of national records or at least, satisfactory performances. All the local athletes who are now out of the Atlanta Games performed below their capabilities and one wonders who to put the blame to for this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact remains and will always be there that Swaziland does not hold good reputation in the Olympic Games. It is even more embarrassing to compare our country with the rest of the African states some which have more unstable economic status than ours. Most nations except for Swazis have realised the importance played by sports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Swaziland being the worst African country in the Olympics, others who are almost on the same line but are quite better include Tanzania, Guinea Bissau, Niger, Botswana and Lesotho. At least some of these countries have managed to advance to the next rounds of their respective competitions and those who have not, have improved their national records yet with Swaziland it is zero.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without maybe mentioning African countries like South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Algeria, Egypt and some others who have good sports facilities, there are good examples such as Uganda, Burundi and Ethopia who are doing it the right way yet they have no infrastructure like Swaziland. Some of them such as Uganda and Burundi are even worse with facilities but have athletes progressing to finals of the Olympic Games and they set themselves a number of national records here in Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is very astonishing that in all the four appearances, Swaziland has not recorded any positive result except earning embarrassment. The Swazi athletes who have been beaten hands down in the Olympic Games include Victor Shabangu (long jump), Themba Makhanya (800me), Daniela Menegon (swimming) and Dan Mathunjwa (boxing). So again, one is left wondering whether it is quite worth it to continue participating in these that the significance of Olympism is not to win but to compete and make friendship with the other participants.  But then, it is unacceptable when a country like Swaziland has to be humiliated for the benefit of the others as it is the case here in Atlanta.  There has never been a time when Swaziland rejoiced for participating in the Olympics except of boasting of exposure which has bore no fruits. We have long passed the stage of making friendship with other countries but now is time to have signs of positive performances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a solution to this problem but there are no people with love for sports who can assist is setting up the standards. It is known to all that the main barrier to sports development in Swaziland is lack proper facilities but neither the government or any of the companies show willingness to assist with setting up the necessary structures. In sports, we need facilities more than anything else and this has been a song for the number of years but no one seems to dance to it. Swaziland is not that poor such that it could not afford a synthetic track, tennis courts, 50-metre swimming pool and a sports hall that will accommodate the number of indoor activities such as boxing, badminton, weight-lifting, volleyball and some others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What should the citizens of this country do for government to see that there is a need to have sports taken more serious? It is even more disturbing to note that we have a Minister in Prince Sobandla who appears to love sports but when it comes to actions, he is a complete write-off. He is only there by the word of mouth. Much is expected from the Minister because he always attends the prestigious sports competitions such the Olympic Games as he is presently in Atlanta and has been in both the Commonwealth and All Africa Games in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To make matters worse, he is the head of the Zone Six Supreme Council for Sports in Africa-Zone Six which comprise countries which are much sensitive when it comes to sports. Holding such a position, our Minister should be exemplary to the other countries by setting good standards in sports development in Swaziland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No miracle is expected from Prince Sobandla's Ministry but only the will to improve the sports sector in this country. We want facilities to be able to perform well both locally and internationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is absolutely no way we blame the athletes but only to sympathise with them to be entered for such big games when they have not undergone any serious preparations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlanta - Botswana's Olympic debutante, Justice Dipeba wilted to pressure when he came fifth in the opening rounds of the 200 metres Olympic dash on July 31, failing to qualify for the next round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He fared well below his 20.7 seconds national record, clocking 21.09 seconds tailing four other runners as Koji Ito of Japan clocked 20.56 seconds to win their heat 10 of the 200 metres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dipeba running from the outside lane took off at a slower pace, than others and only came harder at the closing stages. But it was too late, Botswana's fastest athlete has been eliminated and so were the hopes of the 1.3 million nation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He carried the country's flag into the opening ceremony of these Games, a role which symbolised how much Botswana depended on him - but still he wilted and left locals flattered in the process. Hopes for a medal were placed miles away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His manager, Justice Makole said at the end &quot;he was under too much pressure to perform. And besides, the weather was changing - it was hot&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was his first time in a stiff competition of this kind, and hopefully it was a learning experience, Makole said, &quot;in future he will do better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Dipeba stands to redeem his dwindling image as a reserve in the 4 by 400 metres relay on Friday, August 02. He had qualified for 400 metres race but did not fare in it, preferring to give himself more time in preparing for 200 metres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only boxer, Healer Modiradilo lost in the opening round while Benjamin Keleketu will be the last to participate on August 04 in the men's marathon.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlanta - Three years ago Davis Kamoga was playing football for a local club in Kampala. He did not think of taking to track neither did he believe he could attract the attention of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, his dream was to reach a final in the men's 400m at the Olympic Games. And just as the dream came he had recorded himself as the second Ugandan to win a medal on the track in the Olympic games after legendary John Akii Bua. Kamoga on Monday rose to the gun from lane two against seven big names in the event. He ran down the bend looking beaten. He stretched through to the 300m mark still on a losing trend but as he came to the home straight he was spurting. Over 82,000+ spectators were on their toes, necks craned as they cheered front runner Michael Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Ugandan was not done although he seemed last. Another push and he was making it past the rest save for Roger Black of Britain and Johnson. Had the race went another two meters, silver was Kamoga's goal but all the same he had fullfilled his long time dream.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is now the focus at the Olympic Village and Ugandans scattered in the United States of American have quick to discover the new- found hero. Kamoga himself is in high spirits. he talks less. Poses for photographs and has been signing autographs since Monday when he set his feat with a new national record of 44.53 seconds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ugandans resident in Georgia and surrounding states threw a victory part in the outskirts of Atlanta city Tuesday. To them, it was &quot;Time to celebrate the dreaming , and the hoping, and the reaching, and the believing, and the performing of a special dream&quot; They were congratulating Kamoga and wishing that the 'achievement mark a life time dream come true.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least they had US $400 on offer to the athlete. Education and Sports minister here at the opening ceremonies promised a reward of Ushs 2m/= for bronze medal winners, a feat achieved by Kamoga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ugandans set a target for Uganda government. &quot;If Coca Cola could spend US $ 400m why can not Uganda also spent at least dollars 2000 to 4000 to expose athletes like Kamoga who are set to recapture the glory for Uganda&quot;, said Patrick Ayota a finance director in a vote at the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had been put on the track by National Council of Sports Chairman Geoffrey Kizito, who appealed to the Ugandans in the States to find training opportunities for athletes. &quot;Facilities at home are poor. If you are in positions of influence please find connections for our athletes&quot;, the NCS boss pleaded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the victory of Kamoga alongside greats like race winner Michael Johnson of the USA was a reminder that revival was underway. He said the medal was one of those expected had it not been that several other athletes suffered injury in reference to Julius Acon and Francis Ogola both students of George Mason University College in Washington DC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ayota was not amused that Uganda should continue to be referred to the legacy of Idi Amin when there are other areas to improve the image. He advised there should be priorities on sports and that the phenomenon of calling athletes to train a week to competition should stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We either invest now in sports or never&quot;, Ayota said as he promised on behalf of other Ugandans in USA to assist wherever possible. Kamoga current high profile runs starts three years back when a he attempted the Bugembe grasstrack during a national championship. According to national track coach Absolom Jakech Ojwang, the young soccer player proved better on the track and we advised him to keep it up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Came the 1994 Commonwealth Games and Kamoga, 28, was not considered despite having qualified, something Ojwang regrets. That could have served as his springboard, the coach confesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new one lap expert was however given his chance last year during the East and Central Africa meet in Nairobi. Kamoga won his heats and the final breaking a national record set by Amos Omolo at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City. Heads started rolling and an invitation for the Engen IAAF permit meet was extended where he again performed excellently in Nairobi before another championship in South Africa the same year. Came the World Championship in Gortenburg, Sweden and Kamoga was a semifinalist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ojwang describes his athlete's rise as tremendous. Said the coach: &quot;It is rare for an athlete who started on grass could reach the epitome of the sport in so short a time. First time on the tartan track in Nairobi was victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; It was victory in two years to reach a World Championship( semi final. It is even greater for an athlete of Kamoga's background to win a medal at the Olympics after only three years on the track. Getting an Olympic medal is not a simple matter, &quot; the fiery speaking coach said. He describes the athlete as soft-spoken but 'acts more'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kamoga trains in Italy under an Italian guide and hopes to continue given the support. &quot;I have run many races in Italy and outside it,&quot; he said. He believes many meets at times cause fatigue and stress but he is not ready to forego the chance. Why? 'Because I must reach the limits'. Before he ran his qualifying heats, his focus had been set on at least running under 45.00. He eyed reaching the final at least and be counted among the last eight in the world. He set his feat and now wants to attack the Commonwealth Games due in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His other wish is to find a home in USA to easy and improve his talent like many great athletes who have been successful with bases in USA. Meanwhile, distance runner Acon has blamed his poor performance on the injury he developed while in Europe on altitude training. He said treatment in Washington DC has been horrowful as his coach American tutor tried to make him fit for his first Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1994 world junior champion over the 1500m distance said he under went 15 injections in a very short time when doctors tried to improve his hamstring injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He therefore missed his training during that time and could therefore make a good start at the race. he finished sixth during the qualifying heats.  Grace Birungi in the 400m women on her part lost her kit at warm up an hour to the competition. She told The new Vision a fellow runner mistakenly picked it and it took her 30 minutes to locate. by then she had lost concentration , added coach Ojwang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the other championships, table tennis players Mary Musoke, June Kyakobye and Paulo Mutambuze were eliminated by the strong Chinese, Japanese and Korean pals. they however scored fairly, setting good impressions to their coach Francis Mulinda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mulinda is happy Uganda made a second appearance at the Olympics in table tennis. He hopes they will do better next time. Musoke was the first at the Olympics in Barcelona in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heavyweight weightlifter Ali Kavuma finished 10th in his 108kg weight category with a new national record lift of 260 kilograms. He scored 110 in the snatch and 150 for the jerk. Mario Kalinke of Germany won the gold with a total 390.0 and runners up V. Scerbatihs of Latvia and another German D.  Prochorow also lifted the same weight to grab silver and bronze respectively.</SPAN></P>
