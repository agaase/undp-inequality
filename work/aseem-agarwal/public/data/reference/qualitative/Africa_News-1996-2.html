<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe - Zimbabwean money market rates are expected to firm this week in response to tightening of liquidity levels on the back of a rumoured rollover of government stock issue, dealers said on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rates firmed slightly the week ending March 8 on the back of a market shortage estimated at just 1.9 million zimdollars (211,111 USD).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dealers attributed the move to central bank selling of 90-day treasury bills to discount houses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zimbabwe Development Bank managed to raise 20 million zimdollars (2.2 million USD) from the market through a private placement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the week, the treasury bill rate eased slightly to 29.4 percent, while the rediscount rate was quoted at 29.50 percent last week and the central bank penalty rate at 35 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the foreign exchange market, the Zimbabwe dollar maintained stability with only a large movement of 1.43 percent against the German mark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dealers attributed the move to a weakening of the German mark against most European currencies particularly the pound and the yen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The zimbabwe dollar also gained against the British pound, the Japanese yen but lost 0.26 percent against the US dollar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dealers said depreciative pressure should already have emerged in the US/Zimbabwe dollar rate and movement was expected to occur in the very short term (9.09 ZD = 1 USD)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe - Zimbabwe's tourism industry is showing unprecedented growth, and last year foreign and domestic tourists earned the country over two billion zimdollars (222 million USD), according to the Zimbabwe Council for Tourism chief, David Chapman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chapman said in Harare the turnover from domestic tourists is estimated to have reached 543 million zimdollars (90 million USD).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the impact of tourism on the gross domestic product was significant, with its contribution to GDP growth rising from 3.4 percent in 1990 to 6.6 percent in 1995.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chapman said this was not bad by world standards and in the next five years, tourism would contribute over 10 percent to GDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tourism earnings, as a proportion of Zimbabwe's total exports, rose from 5.56 percent in the early 1990s to 9.93 percent in 1995, which, in itself, was a &quot;fairly significant increase&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said new tourism projects were planned, and the industry was confident of further growth during the period up to the turn of the century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commenting on the new two percent tourism levy, he said, the council understood the reasons for its implementation and gave it total support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At present, only the hotel sector was paying the levy, and the council wanted government to include other tourist-related establishments so that the levy could be reduced to 1 or even 0.5 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The levy will finance operations of the Zimbabwe Tourist Authority, responsible for trourism promotion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zimbabwe Host Programme, to be launched at this week's hotel congress in Nyanga, would include a series of seminars on the value of tourists to this country and how to treat tourists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would involve people from all walks of life so as to create a &quot;tourism culture.&quot; in Zimbabwe, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Initially, the programme would be run by the authority, and would later be run independently of the council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chapman said the programme was &quot;long overdue&quot; as the industry needed to offer top-quality service if it was to compete internationally as well as within the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The council, he said, was lobbying government to ease movement restrictions in the Victoria Falls/Chobe area on the western border with Botswana, and in the whole of southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chapman said the council would also support indigenisation and would be organising workshops to inform would-be entrepreneurs about the tourism industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Problems which faced indigenous businessmen included bureaucracy and the high interest rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, additional funding from the World Bank would soon be made available to the tourism sector, benefiting particularly the indigenous sector.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigeria needs a national energy policy that will harness its abundant energy resources in a cost-effective, environmentally friendly perspective to ensure sustainable development, a leading energy expert in the country has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at an energy/environment seminar in Lagos last week, Philip Asiodu, a retired top civil servant and former petroleum resources secretary (minister), said the new policy should lay down a coherent principle for the development of energy resources over the next 20 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said &quot;while Nigeria must continue with its plans for large scale energy schemes...sufficient attention and resources must be devoted to renewable energy resources... because of the immediate beneficial impact on the lives of the majority of the country's population.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asiodu, who served in Nigeria's energy sector for many years, including as a 'super' permanent secretary (senior civil servant), and later petroleum minister, said although urbanisation was progressing in the country, &quot;it is estimated that over 70 per cent of Nigerians live in rural areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oil accounts for more than 80 percent of the total foreign exchange earnings in the West African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the oil exploration has not been without costs involving mammoth flaring of gas, amid complaints of air, sea and water pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asiodu said &quot;it is also better if by the provision of power in rural areas, working and living conditions can be so improved as to reduce the rate of migration of young adults from villages and rural areas to the misery and crime of urban ghettos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He offered some suggestions for the development and exploitation of renewable energy resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under his proposed national energy policy, Nigeria should tap the abundant solar energy in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It should not be too difficult to demonstrate the efficacy of solar-powered pumps for water supply from boreholes, or lakes and rivers&quot; and &quot;solar powered refrigerators for storage of drugs and vaccines in rural hospitals, solar energy systems to produce electricity for village community centres as indeed for households in villages as well as towns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is also the possibility of developing &quot;wind mills&quot; to power water supply and irrigation schemes in the country, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asiodu, who spoke on Energy for Sustainable Development, said Nigeria should also exploit biomass fuel directly, including the generation of electricity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The seminar was the third in a series by the Nigerian group 'Friends of the Environment'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group was founded in 1993 to address specific energy and environmental problems in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Media reports received in Tripoli at the weekend said the move seeks to end pollution from phosphate mining which now threatens Tunisia's central and southern coastal areas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the Tunisian media, phosphate waste dumping in the gulf will be ended by the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decision announced last weekend by the Tunisian minister of the environment, Hedi Ben Mlika, the Tunisian media said, should end decades of pollution in the Gulf of Gabes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Phosphate wastes have been dumped in the waters of the gulf for at least 30 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Between 10,000 and 12,000 tonnes of waste are dumped daily by the phosphate processing factory at Gannouche, near Gabes, 400km south of Tunis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The situation has become so alarming that Tunisian authorities have now decided to re-establish the zone's ecological balance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The phosphate waste, which cannot be recycled, will be channeled through pipelines to the proposed new dump, which is expected to cost 100 million U.S dollars.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MONROVIA, Liberia - The Liberian capital, Monrovia, a city partially destroyed by a six-year civil war, now hosts over one million residents, two and half times more than the number before the conflct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rapid population growth rate is not a result of the normal rural-urban migration associated with the search of greener pastures but people fleeing the interior for fear of being killed or hurt.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The huge population has compounded problems for the city's already inefficient waste disposal system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sewers constructed for less than 400,000 residents have now been overstretched. The city's sewers now frequently burst open while clogged gutters and culverts are breeding grounds for rodents and unsightly insects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The operations of the Monrovia City Corporation, which is responsible for sanitation, have ground to a halt for lack of equipment. As a result, the minimal waste disposal that is carried out in Monrovia is done by private agencies which lack the capacity to effectively handle the garbage generated by the ever increasing number of residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It not uncommon to see huge piles of solid waste in various corners of the city. Worse still, even the little amount of waste collected is not properly dumped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prior to the war, the almost obsolete land-fill system was the most effective disposal model in Liberia. But this method requires immense capital input in the form of equipment, which government cannot afford at this time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cholera and malaria cases have also increased sharply because of the poor sanitation. There are only two government health institutions working in the city.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal - An Ethiopian academician has advised African and other philosophers to pay more attention to the centuries old experience of peasants in managing the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Workineh Kelbessa of Addis Ababa's Department of Philosophy made this recommendation in a paper entitled 'Ethiopian Peasant Attitudes to the Environment' presented in Dakar last week. The paper was presented at the just-ended symposium organised in the memory of a leading scientist and Egyptologist Prof. Cheikh Anta Diop, who died 10 years ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It highlighted the knowledge of peasants in dealing with pests, weeds, local soils, microclimates, vegetative differences and seasonal environmental changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Indigenous environmental science has played an important role in minimising the ecological constraints,&quot; said Kelbessa. He termed as superficial the perception by Western scholars that indigenous environmental knowledge was primitive and backward and that peasants were agents of environmental destruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Citing rural people in his often drought stricken country, the psycholigist said that through continuous experirments on their own, Ethiopian peasants &quot; have managed to learn how to control weeds, select crop varieties, classify vegetation types and cope with climatic and environmental changes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He commended traditional soil conservation practices such as terracing, contour ploughing, bunding, contour ridging and furrows, crop rotation and intercropping of cereals. Ethiopian peasants also have traditional methods to deal with locusts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;After grinding different types of trees, peasants spray the powder on their land in order to protect it against locusts.&quot; Researchers from the Sahel countries could borrow a leaf from the Ethiopians on how to deal with the insects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kelbessa also highlighted the contribution of African traditional leaders and local institutions in conserving the natural environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The religious conception of the man-nature relationship reflects how the Ethiopian people, particularly the Oromo, harmonize themselves with nature,&quot; he said. The Oromo regard the 'Adbar' tree as a reflection of spirits while the 'Oda' serve as centers for conferences, worship and peace-making. Other sacred trees are the Daki, Miesa, Anfari, Abaye and Galmaa, to name only a few.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Oromo people give important value to green nature. Wet grass is viewed as a symbol of fertility, life and peace. &quot;In many parts of Ethiopia, trees which are grown in the compound of sacred springs remain untouched.  These springs are used only for bathing and drinking. The holy water is believed to be a cure for heart ailments and rheumatism,&quot; said Kelbesa. The people believe evil spirits live in these tress and cutting the surrounding trees causes death, noted Kelbessa. Because there are many sacred groves in almost all parts of Ethiopia, this is good for nature conservation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The philosophy lecturer also spoke about the ability of rural people to use environmental indicators to anticipate changes in the weather.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;On the basis of the movement of migratory birds, peasants anticipate the behaviour of their environment and weather conditions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Contrary to the blanket condemnation by some Western-educated scholars that African pesants destroy their own environment, Kelbessa highlights indigenous environmental ethics which are embodied in social norms and myths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kelbessa disagrees with the allegation by certain academicians that rural people's knowledge is harmful and a major obstacle to development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, he argues that local ecological knowledge is dynamic and innovative, since it stems from prolonged peasant experience. &quot;Peasants are not only receivers of new technology; they are also initiators of development,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Thus, modern environmental ethics can derive many lessons from indigenous environmental ethics. The first lesson to be derived is the ethics of preservation,&quot; noted Kelbessa in his 17-page presentation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - Lagos, Nigeria's fastest growing city and commercial capital, could be washed into the sea within the next 30 to 40 years, unless urgent steps are taken to stem coastal erosion, a town planner has warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The official News Agency of Nigeria on Monday quoted Raphael Kumapayi, vice-president of the Town Planners Registration Council of Nigeria, as saying that something must be done now otherwise the &quot;city of many rivers&quot; could submerge.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Lagos, with a population of six million, had a &quot;fragile coastline.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The city has occasionally been threatened by the ocean surge, which leaves huge flooding in its wake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kumapayi blamed the situation on improper or no study of the character of the city's soil before erecting high-rise buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;All the structures are carried by sedementary sand,&quot; he said. &quot;The sand ought not to carry too much weight as is the situation at present.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the city's coastal problem had been worsened by the prevailing &quot;global warming&quot; and the rise in sea level partly due to pressure from increasing population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A United Nations report, released in 1995, projected that Lagos would be the 10th most populated city in the world by the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kumapayi said that the environment should be taken into consideration before structures are put in place, adding that Nigerians should be compelled to be environment-friendly.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - South Africa is reviewing trading relationships with neighboring countries which are economically weaker, Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He spoke in Lusaka, the Zambian capital, on aspects of a joint communique he signed with his Zambian counterpart Lt. Gen. Christon Tembo.  The occasion marked the end of Nzo's four-day visit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that South African trade officials were preparing new trade guidelines to regulate business with neighboring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;South Africa is currently examining these (trade) issues to balance relations not only with Zambia but other countries in the southern African region,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both men signed a general agreement on economic, social, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It makes easier cooperation in agriculture, livestock, fisheries, trade, industry, mining and tourism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other areas of cooperation provided for in the agreement include monetary and financial arrangements, development of transportation and communications facilities, sport and culture, energy, health and education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pretoria and Lusaka will also cooperate in the training, development and utilization of personnel; cooperate also in migration, combating of crime, conserving nature and in the exchange of scientific and technical information. The two countries also agreed to undertake joint research projects in various fields of mutual interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both states have already initiated cooperation on promotion and reciprocal protection of investment, trade, health and science and technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tembo and Nzo said that the agreement laid the basis for furthering cooperation between the two countries since the collapse of apartheid and establishment of Nelson Mandela's democratic government of national unity in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both states are members of the 12-nation Southern African Development Community. This body is supposed to integrate and develop economies in the sub-region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa has been blamed by the other economically weaker community states of dominating trade in the region. Pretoria, therefore, is renegotiating new trade terms with Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland, her coooperating partners in the Southern African Customs Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other union members have also accused Pretoria of monopolizing trade within their grouping.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Workers and school children were stranded at bus stops waiting for few available transport, while vehicles lined up bumper to bumper at the few filling stations that still had stock.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other towns of the oil-producing country, including the capital of Abuja, have reported fuel shortages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanmwhile, Nigeria's Petroleum Resources Minister Dan Etete has ordered the arrest of five oil marketers accused of hoarding in Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During an unscheduled tour on arrival from a foreign trip Sunday he ordered the arrest of the five men including four filling station managers after he discovered they had fuel supplies but refused to service desperate motorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Etete said he was disgusted at the attitude of the men whom he described as &quot;happy at seeing other Nigerians suffer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation has said the broken down fluid catalytic cracking unit of one of the nation's four oil refineries in southeastern city of Port Harcourt is to be recommisssioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The refineries in Port Harcourt and neighbouring Eleme have an installed capacity of about half of the nation's four refineries, put at 450,000 barrels per day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The corporation said the fault at the Port Harcourt plant had stalled production and the country's overall supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Energy experts say it could take two to three weeks for the unit to resume production after the commissioning, an indication that the fuel shortage could linger for a while.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - The United States government Monday in Lusaka cautioned the government of President Frederick Chiluba to let Zambians themselves choose and elect people they wanted in this year's parliamentary and presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Visiting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Prudence Bushnell made the call Monday in Lusaka at a luncheon hosted for her by United States embassy officials.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Zambia and the U.S. have a lot of things in common. Both countries believe in democracy...&quot; said Bushnell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political analysts and diplomatic observers saw Bushnell's remarks as a rebuke to the Chiluba government's determination to pass legislation to block former president Kenneth Kaunda from standing in this year's general elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) government has published a constitutional amendment bill which, among others, seeks to bar Zambians born of alien parents from holding the office of president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda had Malawian parents who settled in Zambia at the close of the 18th century. They came to the country as missionaries of the Church of Scotland.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigeria's military government has said it is putting on hold a plan to privatize inefficient parastatals, especially the national telecommunications and electricity authorities, because of their huge foreign debts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finance minister Anthony Ani said at the inauguration of Nigeria's Council of Chartered Instutute of Stockbrokers in Lagos Monday that the government establishments were heavily indebted to the World Bank and other financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government, in response to complaints from Nigerians about the glaring inefficiency of the agencies, had set out plans to privatize or commercialize them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Ani said &quot;we are not going to privatize the parastatals because they are owing heavily.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the &quot;indebtedness of the Nigerian Telecommunications Company (NITEL) to the World Bank and others is in billions,&quot; of naira (82.5 naira =1usd).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ani said government would, however, continue with its commercialization of the parastatals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the minister said the Nigerian government is to set up a panel to examine reforms of the country's capital market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The excercise is aimed at &quot;codifying all laws relating to security dealings so that all operators...derive their powers and functions from a common body of legislation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ani said government was also going ahead to acquire &quot;golden shares&quot; in the nation's four big banks. These are the First Bank, Union Bank, UBA and Afribank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some economic experts had warned that undue government control could scare potential investors from the banks, which enjoy commanding status on the Nigerian stock market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Ani dismissed this argument, saying the government plan has received the support of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Nobody has objected to the plan,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;We discussed with the IMF and the World Bank. They did not object to it.&quot;<BR>Benin<BR>Electoral Commission Issues Final Results<BR>(by<BR>Panafrican News Agency<BR>March 11, 1996<BR>by Ali Idrissou Toure, PANA Staff Correspondent<BR>(tx</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia - Africa's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 2.2 percent in 1995 compared with to 1.6 percent the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission, Kingsley Amoako, said in Addis Ababa Monday that this came about despite a series of conflicts and civil strife, drought and other natural calamities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opening the ninth conference of African planners, statisticians, and population and information specialists, the ECA chief said Africa's GDP grew by only 0.8 percent in 1993.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conference meets on biennial basis to examine the economic and social situations in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Its task, within the mandate given by African ministers of planning due to meet here in April, is to advice on what the United Nations Commission for Africa can do to help member states in their development planning challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reviewing Africa's economic performance in 1995, Amoako said the agricultural sector &quot;virtually stagnated last year after exceptional growth in 1994.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to him, per capita food production fell by 2.6 percent. Cereal production fell by 15 per cent in 1995, while manufacturing output dropped by 3.7 per cent in 1994 and 2.8 per cent in 1995, due to low levels of investment and inherent structural weaknesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amoako attributed the continent's improved GDP in 1995 to the mining sector, including a 12 percent rise in oil prices and 20 percent in metal prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa's export that had stagnated in 1994 grew by nearly 16 percent in 1995 as a result of rising commodity prices and external demand generated by the economic recovery in developed states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa's export prices rose by 10.5 percent in 1995, double the 1994 growth rate, while import prices also rose by 7.2 percent the same year against 3.8 percent in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As a result, the terms of trade improved by 3 percent in 1995, an increase of over 2 percent improvement on the previous year,&quot; the ECA executive said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Africa's marginalized position in the world economy makes pursuit of economic integration fundamental to its develop- ment,&quot; he observed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amoako urged the continent's planners and decision makers to see to it that Africa becomes part of the information age to remain competetive and part of an international economic order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conference's agenda includes a study entitled &quot;Building Africa's Information Highway,&quot; which was requested by the ECA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Its aim is to put together an African action plan on using upcoming information and communication technologies to accelerate socio-economic development.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A U.N. media advisory said the launch would be held at U.N. headquarters in New York as well as in Paris, Geneva, Rome, Nairobi, Johannesburg and Abidjan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Addis Ababa-based Organization of African Unity (OAU) will be linked to the live event in New York by satellite.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.N. has described the initiative as the most significant mobilization of international support for development in any region of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said that most of the 25 billion dollars required for the initiative would come from the re-allocation of existing national and international budget priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Bank has agreed to lead in raising the remaining funds, which will be used to provide Africa's basic education, health, peace-building, good governance, water and food security.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal - European businesses have dominated the African scene since the major powers carved up choice parts of the &quot;Dark Continent&quot; for themselves in Berlin a century ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In one form or the other, Belgian, Dutch, French, English and German firms with tacit state backing maintained this dominance until the early 1960s when such Asian tigers like Japan and Taiwan managed to secure a foothold. At the time the United States was busy fighting Soviet Communism in several parts of the &quot;blighted continent&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, with the demise of the Soviet Union, Washington says it will no longer play second fiddle in Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown broke the ice last February in a well publicized five-nation African tour poised to scale what he described as &quot;the world's last commerical barrier&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The United States will no longer concede African markets to traditional colonial powers,&quot; Brown was quoted as telling an audience in Washington ahead of the Feb. 17-25 tour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The European Union countries, he said, gobbled up 40 percent of the market share in sub-Sahara Africa while the United States share was lower than 8 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That makes no sense at all. We have got to change that ratio,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The team toured Botswana, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Kenya and Uganda, and held discussions with an array of government officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Once on the trail, the usual fears about AIDS, monkeys and Ebola were doused by the habitual African hospitality to foreign guests, a detail they could not miss in Ivory Coast, the bastion of Francophone African and a haven for French investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Abidjan, Brown and his team performed what observers say was equal to hoisting the American flag in a foreign land: the inauguration of General Motors sales and maintenance office in West Africa. This was followed by business agreements between U.S. firms and government officials, including a housing contract to Cahdwick International worth 92 million dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These and other ventures were part of some 9 billion dollars worth of potential openings up for grabs in parts of the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Kenya, Brown and his team were received by President Daniel Arap-Moi and the entire cabinet, a point he did not miss in his up-beat address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am the first American secretary of state to set foot on Kenyan soil.  And I hope that sends a clear and undeniable message that Africa is important to the United States of America. We will no longer concede the African marketplace to our European friends or to anybody else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are here to compete for African business on the African continent,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why the change of heart? Since when did Africa cease to be nothing more than a catalogue of woes, where every benevolent cent that came its way ended up in rat holes?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It took years of lobbying by &quot;Africanists&quot; and politicians including President Bill Clinton to bring America's corporate world to start believing that &quot;Africa matters&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Witney Schneidman, a prominent African affairs analyst and vice president of Samuel's International Associates Inc., says postive trends in the continent are changing American corporate attitude to Africa towards closer ties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He cited three examples: American multinational corporations reported 25 percent return on their African investments in the past couple of years, outpacing similar ventures in other developing regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -In 1994, U.S. firms exported nearly 4.4 billion dollars worth of goods to sub-Sahara Africa. This was 22 percent higher than the country's exports to states of the former Soviet Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - African stock markets provided an average of 40 percent return to investors in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Franklin Kennedy of Equator Bank and president of the African Business Roundtable identified export agriculture, light industry, mining, infrastructure development and finance management services as some of the sectors American investors can tap for profit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Based on Equator's experience in managing the African Growth Fund and the Kenya Equity Fund, I can assure you that there is no lack of opportunity for investors,&quot; Kennedy told American legislators in Capitol Hill last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elesewhere, reactions to the American drive have ranged from disdain to veiled hostility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For instance, Washington's brash talk about engaging former colonial powers in business competition in Africa has elicited rumours about &quot;Yankees in a hurry to reap where they did not sow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> France, which has a large political and economic stake in sub-Sahara Africa is not amused by the development which in concrete terms means that Ford vehicles would soon begin to jostle with Peugeot, &quot;the car for Africa&quot;, for a niche in the African market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Jacques Chirac has let it be known that France does not intend to vacate its high stool in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a key address in Gabon soon after he moved into the Elysee Palace late in 1995, Chirac acknowledged that Francophone Africa would have to free its trade and open up business to other investors. But he could not hide his misgivings about &quot;Anglo-Saxons (who) dream of pushing France out of its position in Africa without paying a price.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Africa, pessimists wonder if Africa is not heading for another round of exploitation, in apparent reference to long years of slavery, colonialism and neo-colonialism which stripped the continent of its wealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Using the former Belgian Congo (now Zaire) to make his point, Kwame Nkrumah, that African sage of unsurpassed vision, had a word on foregn investment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The struggle against neo-colonialism is not aimed at excluding the capital of the developed world from operating in developed countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed,&quot; he said in 1974.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Analysts are unsure if most African countries have been weaned from neo-colonialism. But Ron Brown seemed to have allayed these fears when he defined the ultimate goal of the initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our commercial mission to sub-Sahara Africa is an important step toward the goal of bringing together African and U.S. public and private sector representatives to determine the most appropriate and effective role that we can play in Africa's future,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Karyee loyalists are reported to have been carrying weapons seized from the West African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) by Ulimo during fighting in between the two sides in December.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BUJUMBURA, Burundi - At least 13 people were killed by Hutu gangs in two Burundi towns in the last 24 hours, the country's news agency, ABP, reported Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The agency said the attacks took place in in the coastal town of Ramonge, 70 kilometers (43 miles) south of Bujumbura, and in Mpanda, in the northwestern province of Bubanza.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KAMPALA, Uganda - Rebels of Lord's Resistance Army, fighting President Yoweri Museveni's government, shot up a passenger mini-bus Wednesday in northern Uganda killing an unspecified number of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attack, the second in a week, occured two kilometers (1.2 miles) from the Karuma Bridge on the Karuma-Pakwach road leading to the country's West Nile Region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mini-bus was heading to Kampala from the West Nile Regional capital of Arua. It carried about 30 people. Six of the known survivors were rescued by Red Cross vehicles heading for Kampala from Arua, one victim said in Kampala.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shiama Awuma, whose husband was killed in the latest attack, said a Ugandan army unit at Pakwach allowed her group to travel unescorted through the rebel-infested Murchison Falls National Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They assured us that the road was safe. For a long distance we travelled safely. We even passed the scene of last Friday's ambush without any problem,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But as the bus approached the Karuma Bridge, their bus was shot up by rebels, forcing the driver to stop immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Several bullets were shot, killing my husband instantly,&quot; she said, while breastfeeding her crying child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said the rebels later looted the bus and left the survivors and the dead at the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an earlier attack Friday, units of the Lord's Resistance Army, headed by Joseph Kony, attacked a 17-vehicle convoy killing an estimated 70 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the rebel ambush was happening Wednesday, the minister for defense, Amama Mbabazi, was delivering an official government statement to the National Resistance Council, or parliament, about Friday's attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said 59 of the 71 people abducted by the rebels had been released and 12 are still in captivity. The Ugandan Defense Force, he said, had killed 90 rebels and captured 15. At least 60 surrendered and more than 100 were injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said government would give 300,000 shillings, about 200 U.S. dollars to the families of each murdered ambush victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbabazi also said an army lieutenant and two other soldiers died when their truck hit a landmine five kilometers (3 miles) outside the northern regional capital, Gulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only two weeks ago, 21 government soldiers were killed by the rebels at Minakulu along Gulu-Kampala road.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> COTONOU, Benin - The constitutional court in the West African state of Benin rejected the government's decision to shift run-off presidential polls scheduled for March 17 to March 21, saying the postponement was unneeded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The court said Wednesday the ballot should be held &quot;at the latest on March 18&quot;, adding that the postponement was &quot;contrary to the constitution.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Benin's constitution provides that in the absence of a clear winner in the first round of polling, &quot;a second ballot shall be held within 15 days.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decision taken Tuesday by the government to postpone the second ballot to March 21 was challenged in the constitutional court on Wednesday by former President Mathieu Kerekou's support committee. Kerekou is running neck-to-neck against incumbent President Nicephore Soglo, after the first round on March 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soglo won 35.69 percent of the total ballots compared to 33.94 percent for Kerekou who headed the country's military Marxist regime for more than a decade until he was replaced by Soglo in multiparty elections in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two other prominent candidates -- Adrien Houngbedji who wom 19.71 percent and Bruno Amoussou who won 7.3 percent of the votes -- asked their constituents to vote for Kerekou in the final round.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FREETOWN, Sierra Leone - Sierra Leone's Interim National Electoral Commission said the run-off presidential election will take place Friday despite a rebel threat to disrupt the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This second round of voting became necessary when none of the 13 presidential candidates obtained the required 55 percent of the votes in the first election held Feb. 26-27.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Friday's run-off will be between Tejan Kabba of the Sierra Leone People's Party and John Karefa-Smart of the United National People's Party, the two leading contenders from the first election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both men have been campaigning and seeking alliances with lesser parties. Kabba succeeded in gaining the support of the People's Democratic Party, the All People's Congress and the National Unity Party. These are the three parties that gained more than 5 percent of the total votes during the last elections. Parties smaller than these have also given their support to Kabba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A joint international observer group will monitor the election and will convey to the Interim National Electoral Commission, or to the judiciary, any complaints received about the electoral process. These observers also will monitor the legal process of dealing with such complaints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the military is busy with cleaning up operations in rebel-infected areas in the northern and southern provinces of this West African country. The government said it will ensure security on polling day.  There are signs that the run-off will be more peaceful than the elections held in Feburary.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ghanaians, who won a bronze medal at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, struggled for most of the first half when they could not put their act together.. This gave the defensive-minded Cameroonians the chance to come into the picture.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Ghanaians came back into the game in the second half, and despite throwing away a penalty in the 47th minute, scored three goals in the last 23 minutes to win the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first goal came in the 67th minute when Stephen Baidoo headed home a corner kick taken by Mallam Yahaya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ben Hacan scored the second in the 80th minute when he hit the ball into the net after Prince Amoako's shot had bounced off the Cameroonian goalkeeper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hacan was on target again in the 85th minute from a solo effort that put the icing on the cake.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Stars and their officials were ordered Friday by Col. Ike Nwosu, military administrator (governor) of the western state of Oyo, the club's proprietors, to win the match or be &quot;locked up in jail.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the 1995 Football League and Challenge Cup champions playing at home before a capacity crowd, which included Nwosu, managed only a 0-0 draw.  Apart from missing several scoring chances, the Stars missed a penalty kick.  This angered Nwosu, who stormed out of the stadium mid-way through the match.  His reaction has left the players and their officials in suspense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nwosu has still not commented on the fate of the Shooting Stars, Nigeria's representatives in this year's Africa Champions Cup. The team is third from bottom on the 18-club league table.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Col. Ike Nwosu, military administrator (governor) of Nigeria's western state of Oyo, owners of the Stars, said at a meeting with the players and their officials Friday he would have them locked up if they failed to deliver.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He told them &quot;to win the next (Saturday's) match against Inwuanynwu Nationale at all cost... Otherwise I will get all of you locked up.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Stars, who won Nigeria's league and challenge (FA) cups last year, have managed only two draws, and suffered one defeat during 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They are third from the bottom of Nigeria's 18-club league table.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - The World Bank will spearhead the drive for funds under the United Nations Special Initiative for African Development, a UN official said in Lagos Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Janet Badjan-Young, director of the UN information centre in Nigeria, told journalists the bank was ready to mobilise more than 85 percent of the 25 billion U.S. dollars earmarked for expenditure over the next 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said the bulk of the money under the initiative launched by the UN Secretary-General Friday would go into &quot;improving basic education and health&quot; on the continent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said the initiative for Africa seeks to maximize support for the continent's development efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Badjan-Young said African finance ministers had during their recent meeting in Burkina Faso identified 14 components grouped under four themes that reflect Africa's development priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said the UN programme was aimed at providing basic education, health care, promote peace, better governance, and improve water supply and food security in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN official however said &quot;while Africa needs external support, it is the Africans themselves, men and women, who must take charge of their destiny and who should have the fundamental responsibility for bringing about development on their continent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She cited the example of Botswana, which she said was one of the world's poorest countries after its independence in 1966, but which has managed to surmount its socio-economic difficulties.  &quot;Today, Botswana has one of the most prosperous economies in Africa,&quot; Badjan-Young added.  Meanwhile, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) representative in Nigeria, Babasola Chinsman, said the UN initiative was not new, but a re-alignment of what had been planned for Africa.  He urged Africans to fashion out good governance and resource management.  A World Bank senior officer, Eileen Nbwanga, said the abandonment of Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAP) had worsened living standards on the continent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ethiopian Prime Minister said this in a satellite link speech to co-launch the 25-billion US dollar Special Initiative for Africa, inaugurated in New York Friday by UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and World Bank president James Wolfensons.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meles said the initiative is based on priorities OAU member states have identified collectively and individually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the future of Africa lies in the hands of the Africans themselves, he said, the international community has a responsibility, in this inter-dependent world to help Africa overcome abject poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also speaking during the satellite launching ceremony, the Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa, Kinsley Amoako, said the initiative was a great affirmation of the U.N.'s role and commitment to work with African leaders and peoples &quot;to equip Africa to meet the challenges of the 21st century.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Acting OAU Secretary-General Vijay S. Makham said the continental body was in full agreement &quot;that the ownership of the initiative should be vested in each one of OAU member states and that it be based on national programmes prepared by our respective countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Makham said the OAU will popularise the initiative &quot;to ensure the attainment of the laudable objectives of the initiative together with the United Nations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The multi-billion-dollar initiative is aimed at expanding basic education and health care, promote peace and good governance and improve water and food security throughout Africa over a 10-year period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.N initiative also aims at strengthening the OAU's capacity in conflict management and promoting all-round development in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The initiative was simultenously launched by heads of United Nations agencies in Geneva, Nairobi, Rome and Vienna.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muzorewa's withdrawal was announced minutes after his party's application for the postponement of the elections was thrown out by the supreme court in Harare.He is the head of the Unite parties (UP).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other opposition candidate, Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole of ZANU (Ndonga), pulled out on March 12, citing interference into the operations of his party by Zimbabwe's Central Intelligence Organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government election machinery was already in place with thousands of people having been trained in the running of elections already deployed at various stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government on Thursday estimated no less than Zimdollars 50 million (USD 5.6 million) would be wasted if there were no elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muzorewa's withdrawal deals a severe blow to Mugabe's plans of showing the world that he still has a massive following in Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Faced with a largely apathetic voting population, Mugabe has addressed more than 40 rallies throughout the country in five weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has appealed for a massive turnout in the elections, saying low participation could be misinterpreted by the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am confident that I will win but it is not (so) much of the winning that matters, but that we should turn up in our millions. If there is voter apathy, it will be misinterpreted by the international community,&quot; Mugabe told party supporters in Mount Darwin, about 160 km north of Harare, at the start of his campaign trail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UP publicity and information secretary Isaac Manyemba announced Muzorewa's withdrawal, saying a letter to this effect had already been delivered to the Office of the Registar-General, Tobaiwa Mudede.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A copy of Muzorewa's letter to Mudede made available to the Zimbabwe Inter-African News Agency was dated March 14, showing the possibility that the UP had already made its decision to withdraw from the presidential race earlier and was only awaiting the outcome of the application in the supreme court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Explaining the reasons for his withdrawal, Muzorewa said Zimbabwean laws were highly heavily tilted in favour of Mugabe's ruling ZANU PF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His party had also asked for a postponement of the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In view of the fact that our application for the postponement of the presidential election has been turned down, the United Parties central committee has decided to withdraw participation from the presidential elections with immediate effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The United Parties continues to be convinced that no democratic elections will ever be possible in Zimbabwe as long as the current regime of laws and the institutions that govern the conduct of elections remain unchanged,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PARIS, France - The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Friday pledged to contribute towards Africa's education, communication for peace, information technology and solar energy development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The pledge was made in Paris by the UN agency's director-general, Federico Mayor, as Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN secretary general, launched the USD 25 billion dollar Special Initiative for Africa in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;UNESCO will continue cooperating with African governments, the Organisation of African Unity, non-governmental organisations, donors and other partners within and outside the UN system to attain the special initiative's goals,&quot; Mayor said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNESCO's Assistant Director-General for External Relations, Henri Lopes, spoke at length on how UNESCO intends to carry out the 10-year programme, saying it would be different from past ones that had suffered setbacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the past, UNESCO's programmes for Africa faltered because of the lack of financial resources to back them up. This time, however, Lopes said, &quot;with the involvement of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the organisation is assured of obtaining the necessary financial support.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The importance of UNESCO's role should be seen in the context of the large amount of money dedicated to the basic education programme alone, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Half of the intiative's combined costs over the 10-year period will be devoted to this sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This, said Lopes, &quot;will be in addition to UNESCO's present USD 100 million annual budget for education and culture for Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another area in which UNESCO will be involved is the communication for peace-building project which aims at improving communications on the continent, especially radio broadcasting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Communication for peace building will begin with assessement missions in a few selected countries in each of the five major African sub-regions (west, central, eastern, northern and southern).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is estimated that USD 7.8 million will be spent on the programme over the next five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In cooperation with the World Bank and other UN agencies, UNESCO intends to spend an estimated USD 11.5 million to train systems engineers and operators and set up infrastructure to connect Africa with the Internet, including installation of internet nodes with local servers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On completion of the programme in five years time, this project will help Africa become a part of the global information revolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lopes said UNESCO will be working on a 400 million-dollar programme to promote the development of solar energy on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In September, he said, some 15 African heads of state will meet in Harare for a world summit on solar energy. &quot;That the summit will be held in Africa under an African chairmanship, will give the project an upward thrust on the continent,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - Bowing to pressure from the International Volleyball Federation, Kenya and Nigeria have at last agreed to play Russia, an European country, in the Africa Zone Women's Olympic qualification matches in Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two African countries had earlier threatened to pull out of the play-offs, kicking off here Friday, with Kenya taking on the highly rated Russsians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president of the Nigerian Olympic Committee, Raheem Adejumo, had said Thursday &quot;we are determined to go to the level of an appeal if Russia, which was beaten in the European play-offs, comes to infiltrate Africa and attempt to deny the continent its deserved place in Atlanta.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was speaking to the president of the Confederation of African Volleyball, Cote D'Ivoire's Gabriel Guigui, who arrived here Thursday for the qualification matches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Guigui gave an assurance the matter would be taken up with the International Volleyball Federation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenya's team manager Njeri Onyango said it took the intervention of her country's volleyball federation to rescind the boycott decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said having failed to pick a European olympic ticket, the Russians, ranked third in the world, had no business jostling to deny Africa its only berth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Onyango said her team &quot;is psychologically and physically prepared&quot; for the tough task ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> James Kenami, another member of the Kenyan team, which arrived in Lagos Thursday, said they would play the Russians &quot;under protest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in a new twist to the controversy, the president of the Nigeria Volleyball Association, Huba Gumel said Friday in Lagos the IVF was right in drafting Russia into the African zone of the competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He told journalists the federation's guideline stipulates that a minimum of three countries should feature in a qualifying series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gumel said that five African countries had registered for the olympic games elimination series but that only three -- Egypt, Kenya and Nigeria -- qualified to compete after participating in an African championship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Russia was shifted to the African group following Egypt's withdrawal.  Gumel said the IVF might have chosen Russia because of its past record as one of the best volleyball playing countries. Kenya and Nigeria protested vigourously.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KAMPALA, Uganda - Uganda observed Friday a day of national mourning for people killed recently by rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in an ambush in the country's north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An estimated 70 people were shot dead and at least 80 others abducted last Friday when the LRA, headed by Joseph Kony, attacked a convoy of 17 civilian vehicles, escorted by a score of soldiers, on the road betwen Karuma and Pakwach in northern Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sixty of those abducted have been released.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at an inter-denominational service in Kampala, Prime Minister Kintu Musoke appealed to Ugandans to galvanise themselves for peace and fight evil wherever it exists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He urged Ugandan politicians not to exploit the tragedy for political gain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, President Yoweri Museveni has vowed to deal with the LRA rebels by April when he expects to have furnished adequate fire-power to the Uganda Peoples Defence Forces (UPDF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We need comprehensive capacity to deal with a large scale, reasonably equipped aggression if it ever comes, or the nomadic bandits who specialise in attacking soft targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am informing Ugandans, that by the middle of April, this capacity will be operational,&quot; Museveni said in an article published Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the Ugandan army is using a new approach of diminishing expenditure by using less manpower and more technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is now a transformation from a large force of 100,000 men to a smaller force of tanks, aircraft, helicopters and other equipment which will be fully operational by next month,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni ruled out any peace talks with the rebels saying &quot;I am, personally, very opposed to this idea. We extended an amnesty to all rebels many years ago. Many came. Some were even elected to lead up to the National Resistance Council (parliament).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He castigated unnamed Ugandans who think that to bring peace to the north &quot;we need to go to Khartoum (Sudan) and pledge our readiness to Tourabi to islamise and Arabize Uganda by force.We therefore, need to put the whole question into perspective&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hassan Tourabi is believed to be the ideological mentor of the of Gen.  Omar Bashir's Islamic government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sudan and Uganda have on several occassions, especially last year, accused each other of supporting rebels from their territories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At one stage, Khartoum accused Museveni's army of fighting alongside John Garang's Sudan People's Liberation Army fighting against Khartoum in southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PARIS, France - Unita's secretary general Paulo Lukamba 'Gato' said in Paris Thursday that the movement's political commission may not nominate Jonas Savimbi to the post of Angolan vice-president in a new government of national unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Angolan government has offered Unita one of the two vice-presidencies to be created under a government of national unity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">It had been widely assumed that Savimbi, the Unita leader, would take one of the positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is unlikely the Unita political commission will appoint Jonas Savimbi to the post,&quot; Lukamba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lukamba said Savimbi was not very keen on the job and might instead concentrate on his responsibilities as head of his party and de facto leader of the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Savimbi has, however, submitted a list of Unita members that are to be part of the Angolan government of national unity to President Eduardo Dos Santos. The president heads the rival MPLA.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal - The murder trial March 11 of apartheid generals, among them Magnus Malan, attracted surprisingly little comment from the African press. However, one paper which did write on it was the privately-owned Dakar daily, Sud Quotidien.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The generals are facing charges of masterminding the 1987 killing of 13 African National Congress activitists in Kwazulu, Natal, South Africa. The accused have denied doing so.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Once the truth is established and justice prevails, it would be better to forgive,&quot; Sud Quotidien said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;However risky this undertaking,&quot; it went on, &quot;it gives a chance to those who think they are unfairly accused to prove their innocence and thus put an end to allegations of collusion between Inkhata and the white right wing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC, it said, was also taking risks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But it is worth the trouble if this allows the nation to look at itself in the mirror and see its true image,&quot; it said. &quot;Therein lies the first truth and justice will follow: The one that leads to forgiveness, and the basis of true reconciliation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria's semi-official Daily Times talked of Sierra Leone's run-off election due March 15, saying it would be &quot;a dangerous and costly&quot; affair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is especially because the Revolutionary United Front, which had called for negotiations before the Feb. 26 elections (should be held), has threatened to disrupt the elections,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;However,&quot; it said, &quot;Gen. Julius Bio's government must be commended for placing great premium on the will of the people and going ahead with the elections in spite of the security implications,&quot; it said. &quot;This is a mark of statesmanship in tune with the mood of the times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It added: &quot;It is now up to the political elite, who clamored for the elections to hold against all odds, to demonstrate their commitment to national unity and the public interest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's two state-owned dailies, the Amharic language Addis Zemen, and the English medium Ethiopian Herald focused on last week's ministerial meeting on sustainable development and the environment, and on the March 8 Women's Day, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Herald commended the conference's call for measures to alleviate the plight of the hungry poor in the continent through &quot;food safety net.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said the call was important as Africa remains trapped in the quagmires of endemic poverty and degradation, despite its enourmous resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To the question &quot;how goes the much discussed and debated food security crusade in the continent?, the Herald replied &quot;not all that well, if documented evidence is any guide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There has no doubt been some progress in some African countries -- not least our own -- but neither fast nor substantially enough to warrant a sense of fulfilment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Amharic Addis Zemen, writing on the international women's day, wrote &quot;about this alarming global problem&quot; of violence against women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Dealing with gender violence in Africa is difficult everywhere.  Violence against women and young girls remains a chronic problem in Africa in both urban and rural areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Ethiopia, criminal acts like rape, abduction and child molesting are growing alarmingly to the extent of preventing women from going to schools as well as taking part in other social activities, the paper said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For its part, Zambia's privately-owned daily, the Post, commented on the imprisonment of two of its editors: Fred M'Membe, the managing director and editor-in-chief, Bright Mwape, the managing editor; and columnist Lucy Sichone.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They were jailed by parliament for contempt of parliament and breach of parliamentary privileges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The paper noted that there was plenty of vocal opposition to the jailings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Most, if not all, are surprised how it was possible in modern day Zambia for an institution to have the courage to send its citizens to imprisonment without being heard or being given a chance to defend themselves,&quot; the paper said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said that Health Minister Michael Sata and the chairman for the ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy, Sikota Wina, claimed parliament's decisions could not be questioned by anybody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;All serious legal opinion is agreed that our parliament has no power to try or jail citizens,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But so far all government officials have failed to counter the legal evidence that the speaker and his national assembly are wrong in jailing the three writers and should, therefore, release them,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It charged the government with detaining the editors &quot;out of spite and a vindictive trait&quot; which, it said, was plain to see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If this were not so and if government had the ability to accept its mistake, it said, Chiluba could have easily ordered &quot;his rubber stamp parliament&quot; to release the detainees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But President Chiluba is far from being a statesman and a rational leader. We have to wait and see which way the man who calls himself a born again Christian acts,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is no doubt that government has lost face, that is, if it has any face to lose at all,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe - Trade among the 20 states of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, or COMESA, is running at an average of 10.1 percent yearly, marking a substantial degree of cooperation in business and among customs departments, an official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Overall COMESA trade with the rest of the world is growing at 7.4 percent per annum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing journalists Thusday in Harare the official, COMESA Secretary-General Bingu Wa Mutharika, said several measures had been adapted to promote intro-community trade.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As a result, COMESA is now posed to attain the zero tariff target for intra-COMESA trade by the year 2000,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This assessment arises from a 70 percent reduction of customs tariffs by most countries within the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mutharika said member states were negotiating the introduction of the COMESA single goods declaration document which would facilitate the transit of goods across state lines boundries within the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here are two other projects on the Automated System of Customs Data, or ASYCUDA, and Eurotrace as well as the Trade Information Network, TINET. All of these make trade information readily available to businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Considerable progress has been made, in the year, to connect telecommunications networks among the community members. The effort is being funded by the African Development Bank and will cost 275 million U.S. dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of the 20 countries which signed the COMESA treaty, 14 have ratified the document over the past 15 months. These are Burundi, Comoros, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zaire and Zambia,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Angola, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland and Zimbabwe have not yet ratified the treaty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the dual membership to COMESA and the smaller Southern African Development Community, he said relationships between the two groups had made significant improvements over the past four to five months. He said that after the consultative meeting they would continue with the dialogue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PARIS, France - The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Friday pledged to contribute towards Africa's education, communication for peace, information technology and solar energy development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The pledge was made in Paris by the U.N. agency's director-general, Federico Mayor, as Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN secretary general, launched the 25 billion dollars Special Initiative for Africa in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;UNESCO will continue cooperating with African governments, the Organization of African Unity, non-governmental organizations, donors and other partners within and outside the U.N. system to attain the special initiative's goals,&quot; Mayor said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNESCO's Assistant Director-General for External Relations, Henri Lopes, spoke at length on how UNESCO intends to carry out the 10-year programme, saying it would be different from past ones that had suffered setbacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the past, UNESCO's programmes for Africa faltered because of the lack of financial resources to back them up. This time, however, Lopes said, &quot;with the involvement of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the organization is assured of obtaining the necessary financial support.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The importance of UNESCO's role should be seen in the context of the large amount of money dedicated to the basic education programme alone, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Half of the intiative's combined costs over the 10-year period will be devoted to this sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This, said Lopes, &quot;will be in addition to UNESCO's present USD 100 million annual budget for education and culture for Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another area in which UNESCO will be involved is the communication for peace-building project which aims at improving communications on the continent, especially radio broadcasting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Communication for peace building will begin with assessement missions in a few selected countries in each of the five major African sub-regions (west, central, eastern, northern and southern).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is estimated that 7.8 million dollars will be spent on the program over the next five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In cooperation with the World Bank and other UN agencies, UNESCO intends to spend an estimated 11.5 million dollars to train systems engineers and operators and set up infrastructure to connect Africa with the Internet, including installation of internet nodes with local servers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On completion of the program in five years time, this project will help Africa become a part of the global information revolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lopes said UNESCO will be working on a 400 million-dollar program to promote the development of solar energy on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In September, he said, some 15 African heads of state will meet in Harare for a world summit on solar energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That the summit will be held in Africa under an African chairmanship, will give the project an upward thrust on the continent,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNITED NATIONS, New York - Cameroonian President Paul Biya says his country is committed to a peaceful resolution of its dispute with Nigeria over ownership of the Bakassi peninsula in the Gulf of Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a letter to the United Nations Security Council, released in New York Thursday, Biya promised that Cameroon would abide by the decision of the Council, to which the country referred the dispute Feb. 23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The council on Feb. 29, wrote to the heads of state of the two countries urging them to seek a peaceful solution to the dispute, avoid the use of force, and to withdraw their forces to the positions they occupied before the case was referred to the International Court of Justice at the Hague.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The council also requested them to respect the cease-fire which they negotiated in Kara, Togo, in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The world court at the Hague is expected Friday to give preliminary ruling on the dispute over the oil-rich peninsula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Biya said in his letter dated March 7, &quot;I welcome this decision by the Security Council, the only possible guarantor of peace and security in the region, while awaiting the judgement of the International Court of Justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I take this opportunity to reaffirm the determination of Cameroon to make every effort to settle this dispute by peaceful means,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Cameroonian leader also promised to cooperate with a UN fact-finding mission to be sent to the peninsula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cameroon sought the council's intervention on the issue, for the second time in two years, after fresh fighting broke out in the peninsula in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria in a letter to the council Feb. 27, accused Cameroon of instigating the latest attacks, and the previous ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria said in a statement its forces acted in self defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both countries have troops on either side of the disputed territory, where tension flared resulting in skirmishes in February and April 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cameroon also reported the matter to the Organization of African Unity, based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema has initiated diplomatic efforts to settle the dispute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigeria, Africa's most populous country and under intense international pressure, takes yet another key step in its troubled march to democracy in Saturday's local council polls, political analysts say in Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the non-party elections, the first in a series under military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha's controversial 36-month transition programme, Nigerian voters are to choose some 200,000 delegates Saturday through the open ballot system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The polls, foreshadowed by fuel crisis in parts of the oil-producing country, will hold in some 6,919 wards scattered within the 593 local councils of the 30 states federation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Using the electoral college system, the elected delegates will choose councillors from among themselves March 23, who will in turn elect a chairman for each council two days later.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barring logistic problems, the elections would be the first since the last military regime of Gen. Ibrahim Babangida annulled the controverial June 1993 presidential election in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cancellation of that poll, which had been adjudged free and fair by international observers after some eight years of Babangida's transition programme, threw Nigeria into political turmoil. The effects of this still linger in this country of some 100 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Millionaire-politician Moshood Abiola, who claimed victory in the annulled presidential elections, is in detention. He is awaiting trial for treasonable felony after declaring himself Nigeria's president in June 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After crushing internal opposition, mainly from uncoordinated pro-democracy groups, the Abacha administration which took power in November 1993 when Babangida left office in confusion, has stuck to its own political agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A partly elected and nominated National Conference after one-year deliberation submitted a draft constitution to Abacha in July 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This forms the plank of the three-year political timetable announced October 1995 by Anacha. It is expected to end with military handover to an elected civilian government Oct. 1, 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Critics of the regime, including the British-led Commonwealth which suspended Nigeria over the execution in November 1995 of nine minority leaders, have dismissed the transition program as too long. The Commonwealth asked Nigeria to democratize within two years or be expelled from the body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States, South Africa and the 15 European Union countries imposed sanctions on Nigeria for its hanging of nine Ogoni activists, among them author Ken Saro-Wiwa from southeastern Nigeria. They were executed for the May 1994 murder of four of their kinsmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite mounting pressure which has, however, fallen short of an oil embargo that would have hurt Nigeria most, the Abacha administration has insisted its transition program is irreversible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Receiving a group of foreign envoys recently, who returned from a four-month recall for consultation over the November executions, Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi underscored the country's peculiar political problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Urging the cooperation of the international community, he said, &quot;our democracy is that which recognises our cultural, economic and social circumstances.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Justifying his return to Nigeria following the November recall, Washington's ambassador to Abuja, Walter Carrington, said resumption of his post &quot;should not be interpreted as a lessening of U.S. concerns over the length of the (Nigerian) transition process of the human rights situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was a veiled reference to criticism by Nigerian pro-democracy groups that the United States and western countries were softening their hard stance on Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But one African diplomat, who wished to remain anonymous, said Washington and Western countries appeared hamstrung on Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Everyone is avoiding the much-talked about oil embargo, because of the huge investments by the Western countries in Nigeria's major oil industry,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigerian officials have also slammed the &quot;double standards&quot; of the West on democracy and human rights matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the military government has stepped up arrangements for a hitch-free local council polls, shrugging off critics who see the elections as unncessary and a waste of resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposition National Democratic Coalition, in a belated reaction to Abacha's 36-month transition program, recently called for an alternative one-year timetable and a government of national unity to be headed by Abiola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Abacha administration has dismissed the opposition view as a recipe for chaos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Faced with an upsurge in violent crimes, Abacha has said his government would deal ruthlessly with &quot;threats to life and properties,&quot; by strengthening the security services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government has promised tough actions against any attempt to sabotage the transition program. It has also rolled out a new law prescribing up to five years in jail for electoral malpractice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From various accounts, there seems an apparent enthusiasm among Nigerian politicians toward the council polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But some political analysts are cautious, given the recent experience of the Babangida transition that ended in the annulled presidential elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - Former President Kenneth Kaunda's main opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP) is reportedly training a mercenary army to topple the Lusaka government if he is barred from running for president in forthcoming elections, the official Zambia Daily Main newspaper reported Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mail, quoting a senior official of President Frederick Chiluba's ruling Movement For Multiparty Democracy (MMD) government, claimed that Kaunda's UNIP had sent a number of former police and army officers to South Africa and Iraq for military training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's High Commissioner to Zambia John Sterban Friday declined to comment on the report saying he still had to verify its origins.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am sorry I am unable to say anything until I ascertain where the report came from,&quot; Sterban told PANA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ruling party provincial chairman for Lusaka Christopher Chawinga, a former Zambia airforce officer himself, told the mail Thursday that an MMD sympathiser within UNIP handed over a list of 15 men sent by UNIP to South Africa for military training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIP Secretary-General Sebastian Zulu was Friday quoted by the mail to have denied knowledge of the plot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government officials are known to be suspicious about Kaunda's &quot;cordial&quot; relationship with South African President Nelson Mandela and his ANC-led government of national unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda said Wednesday that he had last week in Lusaka met visiting South African foreign minister Alfred Nzo who had paid a four-day official visit to Zambia at the invitation of the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former president is this weekend scheduled to travel to Cape Town, to attend the inauguration of an anc archives at Fort Hare University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela will be the guest of honour at the ceremony and officials of the university were this week quoted as saying that they had invited kaunda in appreciation of his personal contribution to the South African Liberation struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba's government has proposed legislation to bar first-generation Zambians from holding the office of president. This would effectively block kaunda who is of Malawian parentage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda has vowed to challenge the proposed law and last week said there could be violence if the government went ahead to exclude him from the polls.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - Only about two million people, or 46 percent of Zambia's eligible voters have been registered for upcoming elections during a three-month exercise which ends Friday, officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The public liaison officer of the electoral commission, Joel Sikazwe told local reporters in the capital, Lusaka, that only 2,032,324 voters had registered as of 1 March when the exercise was extended for the third time to March 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Initial projections were that between 4 million and 4.5 million voters would participate in the presidential and parliamentary elections. The country's population is curently estimated at nine million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The registration exercise which began Dec. 12 had been extended two times. It was originally scheduled to end Feb. 9 when it was brought forward to March 1, and later to March 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The last registration exercise carried out in 1987 and updated during the 1991 first multiparty elections in 17 years documented 2.9 million voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those now registered will be issued with voter's cards to be prepared by Nikuv Computers, an Israeli firm contracted by government to update the national voters register.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sikazwe said Nikuv would compile a list of the voters on a computer disk and take them to Israel where the cards will be printed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The company cannot produce the cards locally because the machines needed for the job were too huge to be shipped to Zambia, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Zambian high court is currently dealing with a fresh petition filed by the main opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP) of former President Kenneth Kaunda and the Liberal Progressive Front (LPF) of former legal affairs minister Roger Chongwe challenging the Nikuv contract.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> COTONOU, Benin - President Nicephore Soglo of Benin was Thursday reported to have denied saying run-off presidential poll would be held on Monday, the national radio reported Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, it was the same radio station which covered Soglo's electoral campaign in the Oueme department (southeastern Benin), which said Thursday afternoon that the president endosred March 18 for the poll after the constitutional court rejected the government's postponement of the exercise to March 21.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Radio said Soglo made the denial Thursday afternoon in Dangbo (Oueme department).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is confusion now even among members of the government with certain ministers talking of March 21, while others supported March 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another source close to the president said the government would take stock of technical and material preparation for the run-off with the electoral commission on Friday, before announcing a final date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the first round ballot on March 3, Soglo ran neck-to-neck with Mathieu Kerekou, head of the Marxist military regime which ruled the country for 17 years until Soglo replaced Kerekou in the multiparty elections held in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two other runners-up have switched support to Kerekou.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The situation has resulted in &quot;colossal losses&quot; to businesses and traders in the sub-region, the agency reported, quoting investigations by its reporters from the border town of Badagry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigeria-Benin frontier is a major route for the movement of goods and services within the 16-nation community.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Benin closed its side of the border for four days starting Feb. 29 for its presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria, citing &quot;national interest and security reasons,&quot; closed its side of the border on the same day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Benin ambassador in Nigeria, Jean-Claude Kpakpo, told PANA Nigeria had notified his government it was closing the borders &quot;temporarily until further notice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NAN reported that hundreds of travellers from ECOWAS countries were now stranded with their goods at both sides of the border posts following the closure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said a large number of Nigerian importers who use the Cotonou seaport in Benin were &quot;groaning under accumulated demurrage and freight charges as their goods could not be brought into Nigeria through the borders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the agency, more than 500 imported second-hand vehicles and about 300 trailers loaded with iron rods, cotton, spare parts, grains and textiles are parked at the Benin end of Seme border, while a large quantity of goods bound for Nigeria are still at the Cotonou port.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many of the stranded travellers are camped in mission houses at the border towns of Badagry and Owode, NAN said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It quoted one stranded traveller, Mathew Ogundele, as saying, &quot;This is our third week here, and having spent all our money on feeding and other expenses, we don't know when the border will be reopened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ogundele, who said he was travelling to Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire said the Catholic mission in Badagry had provided him and some 200 others free accommodation, while those who could not wait had abandoned the journey.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FREETOWN, Sierra Leone - President-elect Ahmed Kabba, 64, of the Sierra Leone People's Party, will be sworn into office March 29, the country's military ruler said Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a nation-wide radio broadcast, the chairman of the National Provisional Ruling Council and head of state, Brig. Gen. Julius Bio, called on all Sierra Leoneans to support Kaba in establishing democracy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bio said, also, that he would meet Monday in Abidjan, Cote D'Ivoire, with the leader of the rebel Revolutionary United Front, Foday Sankoh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The front had opposed elections and tried to disrupt them in attacks in the first round. However the rebels, who have been trying to overthrow successive administrations in Freetown, declared an uncondiditional ceasefire after Kaba's election Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bio said this was a welcome gesture toward the final end of the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the ruling council has issued Decree No.6, &quot;the idemnity and transition decree 1996.&quot; This indemnifies members of the junta and their agents from any wrongdoing since they assumed office April 29, 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The measure also revokes the proclamation which established the council and serves other connected purposes and will come into effect on the date Kaba assumes office.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe - It was a vote to give legitimacy to the presidency of Zimbabwe but in the end it was also a vote to uphold the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was a thmubs-up vote from the rural peasantry, constituting about 80 percent of Zimbabwe's population and the main beneficiaries of government largesse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was also a protest by urban Zimbabweans who are most affected by government's austere economic reform program launched in 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And when it all ended in Zimbabwe's second presidential elections March 16 and 17, this southern African nation of 10.5 million was back to where it all started 16 years ago: The ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU PF) leader, Robert Mugabe, 72, being declared President for yet another six years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he begins the second and probably his last term standing on a much reduced popularity pedestal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mugabe, who was assured of victory from the start because of a weak and disorganized opposition, spent more than five weeks addressing rallies throughout Zimbabwe imploring his supporters to turn out in their millions in the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am confident that I will win but it is not much of the winning that matters, but that we should turn up in our millions. If there is voter apathy, it will be misinterpreted by the international community,&quot; he said at one rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, some 600,000 people who voted Mugabe into power in 1990 changed their minds this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was a total drop of 1.03 million in the number of people who cast their votes in the presidential elections between 1990 and this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A total of 1.56 million cast their ballots, representing 31.8 percent of registered voters. Of these, 1.4 million or 28.7 percent of registered voters supported Mugabe. However, he received 92.8 percent of valid votes cast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the 1990 presidential elections, some 2.58 million people cast their ballots with 2.03 million or 42.2 percent of registered voters supporting Mugabe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Were it not for recognizing the provisions of the electoral act, the presidential race would have been aborted following the last moment withdrawal of challengers Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole of ZANU (Ndonga) and retired United Methodist Bishop Abel Muzorewa of the United Parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The gospel, according to the two preachers, was that the playing field was uneven and that the constitution governing Zimbabwe was lopsided in favour of the incumbent and his party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, being such a stickler for the law, Mugabe told the nation to regard Sithole and Muzorewa's apparent withdrawal as legally null and void.  Mugabe called on voters to turn out in their thousands to exercise their right and elect a national leader of their choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several hundreds of thousands heeded Mugabe's call in the rural areas.  Since independence in 1980, the countryside has been the target of government-subsidised health services, primary school education and, during recurrent drought periods, free food handouts and agricultural inputs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in the main urban centres, choking with rampant unemployment and poverty due to the debilitating effects of the harsh economic reform programme, only a trickle of party faithfuls trudged to polling stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Muzorewa and Sithole pulled out of the race last week, citing flawed electoral laws and government interference in their operations, their withdrawals were declared invalid as they were made less than 21 days before the first day of polling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the pull out, Muzorewa got 4.8 percent of the valid votes (72,600) while Sithole had 2.4 percent or 36,960 votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This weekend election could signal the last in which the three veteran politicians will participate, judging from their ages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mugabe will be 78 years at the expiry of his term of office. Sithole will be 82 years and Muzorewa 77 years six years from now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But who knows, Zimbabwe might see another presidential contest pitting the three against each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If so, there should be no surprise as Zimbabwe would not be the first country with an octogenarian leader.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kerekou received 59 percent of the total votes cast to defeat incumbent President Nicephore Soglo, a former World Bank official who replced him five years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kerekou, was born Sept. 2, 1933 at Kouarfa in the northwestern Atacora Division of Benin.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kerekou attended Saint-Louis secondary school in northern Senegal and Frejus and Saint Raphael military schools in France. He joined the army and was commissioned in August 1961 as a sub-lieutenant. He became lieutenant the following year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He served as aide-de-camp to the first president of Dahomey (later renamed Benin), Hubert Maga, up to 1963.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kerekou was promoted commander of the 1st Company of the 1st Infantary Battalion of the Benin army from 1963 to 1966.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He participated in a 1967 coup d'etat which overthrew the regime of Christophe Soglo, uncle of the outgoing president Soglo whom Kerekou defeated in run-off presidential elections Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Solgo ousted Kerekou in Benin's first multiparty elections in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Between 1967 and 1968, Kerekou was chairman of the ruling Revolutionary Military Committee, during the military regime in which Lt. Col. Alphonse Alley was head of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1970, Kerekou graduated from the Infantry Staff School in Paris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From 1970 to 1972, he was appointed head of the infantry and in October 1972 he led the coup d'etat which brought him to power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His regime embraced Marxism after mercenaries led by Bob Denard invaded Benin in 1977. Circumstances forced him to drop the ideology in 1990, and later a national conference adopted a new constitution which barred army personnel from holding political office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gen. Kerekou is often referred to as &quot;the Cameleon&quot; because he was fond of repeating the proverb according to which &quot;the cameleon will never break the twig on which its stands&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the national conference, Soglo replaced Kerekou as head of a transition government which prepared for the country's first multiparty elections in more than two decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kerekou was considered &quot;politically dead&quot; after Soglo defeated him by a wide margin in the 1991 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But like the cameleon, Kerekou hibernated in his family home in Cotonou only to surface a few months to the March 3 election when he emerged runner-up to Soglo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He finally won the run-off Monday when two other political partities threw their support behind him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Provisional results released Tuesday by the election commission in Cotonou said he received 59 percent of the total votes cast.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal - The decision of the European Union to subject senegalese fish exports to it new quality standards as from June, has begun to take its toll on the country's fishries industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the fishing companies in Senegal may not be able to meet the new standards for exports to European markets, Dougoutigui Coulibaly, Permanent Secretary General of the Shipowners and Fishries Industries in Senegal (GAIPES) told PANA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These companies, he said, may have to suspended operations pending compliance with European requirements, Coulibaly said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> European Union countries, especially France, Italy, Germany and Spain, received 90 percent of Senegalese exports of sea foods worth more than 100 billion Francs Cfa (about 200, million dollars) in 1995, Coulibaly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is preferable that Senegal decides to temorarily shut a few companies not approved by the EU, rather than lose the entire European market,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of the companies he added may howver never be able to meet the high standards set by the Union, meaning they would be eliminated from exporting products up north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coulibaly acknowledged that the companies were warned in 1989 about the new standards, but added that most of them lacked the financial means to upgrade their operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He cited the case of 'AMERGER' company, which invested one billion CFA francs (about 2 million dollars) in upgrading its operations to meet the standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The measure has also affected the Senegalese Small-Scale fishing since three-quarters of the fish exported come from small fishermen, coulibaly said.  Cape Verde and Mauritania had even suffered more severe penalties over standards of fish exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Senegalese products are known for their quality and have rarely been rejected in European markets&quot;, he stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The deadline set by the EU, to start implementing sanctions against any country not complying with its standards, is June 1996.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - South Africa, which has been described as an emerging market, attracted 5.2 billion U.S. dollars (20 billion rand) of overseas investment in 1995.  The managing director of Cazenove Co.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stock Brokers in London, James Skinner, attributed this success to international goodwill resulting greater political and economic stability since the election of Nelson Mandela's government of national unity in April 1994.  Addressing an investment forum in Lusaka Tuesday, Skinner said South Africa's strengths as an investment site had attracted both short-term portfolio investment and more long-term fixed investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He cited these as significant mineral resources, large pool of accessible labour and diversified and well organised agricultural sector.  However, he said the continuing risk of investing in South Africa could come from the alienation of the Inkatha Freedom Party from the constitutional process and failure to hold elections in Kwazulu Natal and the Western Cape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other risks, he said, were the high rate of crime and violence, lack of commitment to privatisation and administrative failure in a number of regions and problems in central government, particularly with revenue collection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He noted that of the 10 world exchanges that showed the greatest gains in gross domestic product in 1994 six were in Africa: They were Egypt, Ghana and Tunisia which rose more than 100 percent; and Kenya, Morocco and Nigeria which rose to 75 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, he said the problem in these countries remained the lack of liquidity, which was bad in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cazenove, one of the leading London stockbrokers, acts as London broker for some 25 South African companies. It is also broker for Zambia Consolidated Copper Mining Limited.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - The Zambian kwacha continued to deppreciate against major foreign currencies this week, amid fears among currency dealers of further decline during 1996 due to inflation currently running at an annual rate of more than 50 percentt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A forecast published Tuesday by Standard Chartered Commercial Bank said that there was a danger the local currency could continue to fall and adversely affect government's projected six percent growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The kwacha was Tuesday selling for at 1,158 for one U.S. dollar and at 1,770 for the British pound sterling. The South African rand fetched 295 kwacha at the main Barclays Bank business center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Analysts said Tuesday the irregular hard currency inflows from donors and the generally high demand for foreign currency by local importers had contributed to the presure on the kwacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia has since late 1995 been importing famine relief maize grain to make for the local shortfall caused by drought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finance minister Ronald Penza in January when he presented the 1996 budget forecast six percent growth in the national GDP between now and 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia late last year qualified to borrow under the more favourable Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) of the International Monetary Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Penza has said that the longer repayment periods and lower interest rates under the facility would bring more hard currency available in the country and help to stabilise the kwacha.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The figures compared with 11.96 million shares valued at 117.3 million naira in 1,010 deals in the preceding week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Lagos floor recorded a decline with 837 deals for 4.2 million shares worth 37.8 million naira compared with 896 deals in the preceding week for 8.3 million shares valued at 91.4 million naira.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turnover also fell at the Ibadan floor with 300,000 shares valued at 3.1 million naira changing hands in 66 deals as against 1.6 million shares with a market capitalisation of 5.09 million naira in 67 deals in the preceding week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Port Harcourt 34 deals were executed for 60,000 shares worth 900,000 naira, while the turnover in Kaduna stood at 25 deals for 40,000 shares value at 400,000 naira for the week under review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Investors in Onitsha traded 1.3 million shares worth 6.5 million naira in 60 deals as against no transaction in the preceding week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Kano floor recorded 400,000 shares worth 3 million naira in 29 deals compared with the preceeding week's 2 million shares executed in 19 deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Overall, the price movement remained positive as the NSE all-shares index appreciated by 48.95 points to close at 5229.49 in the review period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, activity in the money market was mixed last week with the securities market becoming bullish, while inter-bank market remained sluggish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The open market operations (OMO), where short term security instruments of government are discounted, maintained the upbeat with 6.280 billion naira worth of treasury bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this fell short of the bids which closed at 9.460 billion naira, up by 3.180 billion naira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 35-day instrument matures on April 19, with the Central Bank of Nigeria selling rate closing at 12.4413 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three weeks after the release of the guidelines on credit, monetary and exchange policies by the apex bank, lending activity had still to pick up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Analysts blamed the lull in treasury activity on bankers' reservation with the cap on lending and interest rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They say a floating rate is preferred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was indication that some banks have been defying the official interest rate policy, by lending at an average of 35 percent above the statutory maximum of 21 percent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe - Foreign investors, allowed for the first time to participate on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange in June 1993, have so far purchased and sold shares worth over 2.312 billion zimdollars (257 million USD), brokers said on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a commentary, the stockbroking firm Edwards (Amper) Company said the net inflow between June 23, 1993, and the week ending March 8, 1996, was 1.153 billion zimdollars (140.2 million USD).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The company, in a review of the performance of the stock market, said there were indications foreign investors were still in the market as net buyers, amid signs the economy could recover on the back of an improved agricultural season and the mining sector's performance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said there were a lot of foreign-to-foreign deals, particularly in the industrial heavyweights such as Bindura Nickel Corporation, Delta Corporation and PG Industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Edwards said local investors had retreated to the sidelines to digest recent corporate results, and also await new incentives which might emerge after presidential elections held on March 16 and 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over the next few weeks, it said, the movement of the key industrial index, a safe barometer used to gauge the country's economic performance, would be guided by political developments and exchange rate fluctuations, rather than market sentiment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the index could either soar to new heights or downsurge depending on the outcome of the eagerly awaited company results from Delta, its subsidiary Zimbabwe Sun, and the timber production firm PG Timbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimbabwe's stock market, once judged the worst performer among 54 emerging indices surveyed by the International Finance Corporation in 1993, has staged a dramatic recovery, ending 1995 as the third best emerging market for the second year running.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recovery of the stock market, which in 1993 crashed by over 70 percent in value terms, has been boosted by government moves to liberalise investment and exchange controls under market reforms launched over five years ago.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - President Frederick Chiluba has ordered drastic reduction on the prices of council houses currently on sale by various local authorities to sitting tenants, in a move generally seen as intended to appease the electorate ahead of this year's general elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The houses were being sold under a revived home-ownership scheme initiated by former president Kenneth Kaunda's regime in the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba's Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) government had in 1995 revised the conditions of sale and allowed councils to determine pricing for the various housing units in their respective areas of jurisdiction.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba last week intervened in the sales and accused councils of &quot;exploiting&quot; the public by charging high prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Politics now is about shelter and food. Most of those houses are old and dilapidated...moreover the tenants have already paid back what had been spent by councils to put up the houses years ago,&quot; he said last Wednesday at a news conference in the capital, Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president is currently touring council housing estates in the northern copperbelt region. Last Saturday, he undertook a similar tour of several council townships in the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some councils, including Lusaka City Council had pegged some of the bigger medium density housing units at 9,000 U.S. dollars each, and up to 30,000 dollars for those in the low density areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similar houses in the capital, Lusaka, cost between 1, 800 and 4,000 U.S. dollars during the last sales in 1989 when the local currency exchanged at 10 kwacha to one U.S. dollar.  Chiluba Monday in northern copperbelt town of Chilabombwe suggested that some of the more dilapidated units could be given out &quot;free&quot; to the tenants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Analysts have reported a slump in the housing construction sector over the past several years due to high cost of materials and decline in effective demand for urban housing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ACCRA, Ghana - The Centre for Policy Analysis (CEPA), has called for a holistic approach to the country's management to avoid more negative repercussions in the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CEPA, which is an independent non-governmental body, criticised the government's economic policy management in recent years and said the the policy frameork is flawed for its over-reliance on aggregate demand management to the exclusion of supply enhancement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Launching the 'Macro-Economic Review and Outlook for 1996' in Accra last week, Dr. Joe Abbey, executive director for CEPA, said the prospect for improved economic performance for 1996 remains dim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;CEPA's independent assessment of key macro-economic variables such as the rate of inflation, the exchange rate, the interest rate and real GDP growth rate suggest that the government is more likely to incur a budget deficit for the fiscal year,&quot; Abbey said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Centre, he said, believes that major components of revenue projected by the government in the 1996 budget are out of trend, unidentiflable, unsustainable or unattainable.  Abbey said average inflation in 1996 will be in excess of 70 percent and the end of year inflation in expected to be in excess of 80 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He explained that weak monetary management by the central bank does not help to keep inflation under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This weak monetary control coupled with strong inertia forces will cause inflation in 1996 to be even more problematic, and if care is not taken to prevent this, the country is likely to end up with a high monetary growth rate with its consequent inflationary ramifications,&quot; Abbey said.  CEPA projects that the trade deficit of the country will increase from 235.8 million dollars in 1995 to 333.9 million dollars in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It explained that the current account deficit is expected to increase from 1.8 percent of GDP during last year to 2.7 percent in 1996, while the overall balance of payment deficit will rise from 247 million dollars to about 503 million dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Thus, the trend toward declining trade deficits and current account deficit as propositions of GDP experienced over the last two years will be reversed in 1996.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abbey said Ghana's external debt is projected to increase by about 8.4 percent to five billion dollars, a rate not higher than real GDP growth of five per cent, &quot;raising issues of sustainability and future debt burdens&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said 1996 may be worse unless the nation wakes up to the hard realities and signals from the economy and takes decisive and appropriate measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The wide fluctuations in the GDP growth rate and the sharp divergences in sectoral growth patterns during the period of 1990 to 1995, he said, are suggestive of systematic weaknesses, which if not reversed may have dire consequences for future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For instance, he said, the agriculture sector which is vulnerable to weather extremes has seen a decline in its share of GDP during the period with low levels of investment and technological backwardness continue to plague the sector.  Economic growth has been further constrained by the level of both domestic and foreign savings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As a result of declining incomes, private domestic savings has also been declining, as private households struggle to cope with higher expendittures resulting from higher inflation.  &quot;This review and prognosis suggest that we must re-examine our policy framework and directon&quot;, Abbey said.  He stressed the need to devise and introduce measures to improve the capacity and the ability of the real (agriculture) sector to respond to incentive signals, with enhanced private sector participation.  He said fiscal discipline must also be an integral part of any genuine development programme, adding that there is the need to re-examine the level and quality of public expenditure.  The exchange rate, he said, must be managed to maintain external competitiveness. The said intervention by the central bank to smooth out fluctuations in exchange rate using foreign loans and divestiture receipts is not a viable strategy.  Abbey also stressed the need for political parties to subsume short term political gains in favour of long-term national development objectives.  Ghana is regaded as a model of economic structural adjustment and trade liberalisation espoused by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.  The backbone of its economy is the Ashanti Goalfields Company Limited, which was listed on the New York Stock Exchange last month.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - The manufacturing sector's share of Zambia's total Gross Domestic Product (GDP) fell marginally from 24.7 percent in 1994 to 24.6 percent in 1995, the country's National Commission for Development Planning has said in its 'Economic Report 1995'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report attributed the decline partly to governement's continued trade liberalisation which had increased competition on the local market from cheaper or better imported products.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia's manufacturing industry in 1995 earned some USD 525,000 from USD 550,000 recorded the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the report, only non-metallic mineral products and fabricated metal products had registered increases in their contribution to real output while the basic metal products sub-sector had also stagnated, for the third year running.  Among manufacturing sub-sectors which experienced a decline were food, beverages and tobacco, textiles and leather industries, wood and wood products, paper and paper products. Others included chemicals, rubber and plastic products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) government of president Frederick Chiluba in 1994 enacted &quot;the competition and fair trading act&quot; to regulate trade competition locally.  The law is intended to introduce a code of conduct for all business entities and ensure fair competition on the market.  Chiluba's government has been blamed, by the opposition and commercial and industrial sectors, for stiffling local industry since the adoption in 1992 of a free market economy.  Zambia has been swamped by cheap goods, including textiles and foodstuffs, from especially neighbouring South Africa.  South African foreign minister Alfred Nzo said during a recent visit that Pretoria was currently trying to balance its trade with Zambia and other neighbouring states. The trade is currently in South Africa's favour.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BADAGRY, Nigeria - Trans-border trade between Nigeria and 15 other countries of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has been paralysed since the February 29 closure of the Nigeria-Benin borders, the official News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) has reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The situation has resulted in &quot;colossal losses&quot; to businessmen and traders in the sub-region, the agency reported, quoting investigations by its reporters from the border town of Badagry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigeria-Benin frontier is a major route for the movement of goods and services within the 16-nation community.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Benin shut its own side of the frontier for four days from February 29 for its presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria, citing &quot;national interest and security reasons,&quot; closed its own side of the borders on the same day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Benin ambassador in Nigeria Jean-Claude Kpakpo told PANA Nigeria had notified his government it was closing the borders &quot;temporarily until further notice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NAN reported that hundreds of travellers from ECOWAS countries were now stranded with their goods at both sides of the border posts following the closure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said a large number of Nigerian importers who use the Cotonou Seaport in Benin were &quot;groaning under accumulated demurrage and freight charges as their goods could not be brought into Nigeria through the borders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the agency, more than 500 imported second-hand vehicles and about 300 trailers loaded with iron rods, cotton, spare parts, grains and textiles are parked at the Benin end of Seme border, while a large quantity of goods bound for Nigeria are still at the Cotonou port.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many of the stranded travellers are camped in mission houses at the border towns of Badagry and Owode, NAN said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It quoted one stranded traveller Mathew Ogundele as saying &quot;this is our third week here and having spent all our money on feeding and other expenses, we don't know when the border will be reopened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ogundele, who said he was travelling to Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire said the Catholic mission in Badagry had provided him and some 200 others free accommodation, while those who could not wait had abandoned the journey.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe - A committee formed last year to promote trade and investment in developing countries began a two-day meeting in Harare on Tuesday, to map out strategies to revive third world economies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The inaugural meeting of the Committee on Investment Trade and Technology (CITT), which was launched in November last year at the G-15 summit of developing countries in Buenos Aires, is expected to come up with recommendations to guide the future of economic co-operation among them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement at the opening ceremony, Zimbabwe's industry and commerce minister, Herbert Murerwa, said the objective of CITT was to broaden and intensify the scope of intra-G-15 economic co-operation, particularly in the areas of the liberalisation, facilitation and promotion of trade, investment and technology.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the two-day deliberations and their outcome would be crucial in setting the tone, direction and impact of the initiative on the future development of economic co-operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main function of the committee, he said, was to serve as &quot;a flexible, consultative, overeaching and trans-regional mechanism to facilitate continuos dialogue&quot; among member countries in the three main areas of trade, investment and technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To perform this function, the CITT would draw extensively from the the work and contributions of existing G-15 projects and structures, Murerwa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Murerwa said establishing priorities for the CITT work programme would not be an easy task as there would be need to avoid duplication on the one hand and establish a limited, focused and business-responsive list of priorities on the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commenting on the current global economic situation, Murerwa said it was characterised by growing interdependence and greater integration among countries of varying levels of development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He noted that effects of globalisation and liberalisation of such areas as production, trade, investment, money and finance, services and technology were increasingly impacting on the member countries' economies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The impact he said, could be both positive and negative, presenting new opportunities for growth and development as well as challenges for the member countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In concluding his speech, he said that while everyone was aware of the objectives of the G-15, it was necessary to define the practical mechanisms and means for achieving the end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this regard, he said, the establishment of the G-15 projects, particularly the South Investment, Trade and Technological Data Exchange Centre (SITTDEC) and the Business and Investment Forum (BIF) represented the member countries' resolve to promote &quot;feasible and meaningful co-operation among the countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The G-15 is a loose coalition of developing countries comprising Argentina, Algeria, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, Mexico, Jamaica, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Senegal, Venezuela, Peru, Nigeria and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KHARTOUM, Sudan - Date palms, introduced in Sudan from Saudi Arabia centuries ago, have fully adapted to the climate and the palms now contribute significantly to the country's food self-sufficiency drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The crop, which usually competes with the minarets of mosques in desert oasis in the race towrad the sky, has been adapted to the humid tropical climate of Equatoria, where temperatures average 40 degrees centrigrade in certian periods and annual rainfalls reach 1,000 cubic millimeters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The date palm fruit is rich in glucose sugar, a fact which explains why muslims use it as starter for Ramdan meals after the day-long fast.  Doctors also recommend it for patients with hemoglobin and other blood blood related deficiencies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Experts say a handfull of dates can sustain a human being for six hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dates are also useful as &quot;food nuts&quot; during long travels and periods of famine. If properly sun-dried, hard dates can be preserved for more than twelve months. They can be preserved soft and fresh for more than a year if packaged in polythene bags or tin containers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The number of date palm trees in Sudan is currently estimated at one million, concentrated in the extreme northern part of the country along the River Nile. They produce 100,000 tonnes of dates each year, most of which are consumed locally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The high adaptability of date palms have encouraged farmers to grow them in Darfur State in the extreme West and in the coastal areas of the Red Sea, known to suffer long periods of drought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abdalla Ali, a Khartoum-based farmer says the trees he planted have fully adapted to the weather.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the past I used to harvest my dates during the rainy season but little by little this has changed and I can now harvest them before the rains,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, an Iraqi expert has warned that offshoots should not be left to grow with the mother tree as they will reduce its consumption of food and nitrates and reduce its productivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Salih Muhsin Badr of the Arab Organisation for Agricultural Development working on a project for improving and multiplying date palms in Sudan told PANA &quot;offshoots should be weeded as early as possible because if left to grow they will share the food it obtains from the soil and it will grow weak and fruitless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Sudanese and other African producers should recognize the viabilty of fertilization of date palms to achieve higher yields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Branches should be reduced to the minimum and dry branches should be cut immediately while date clusters should be reduced to let the fruit grow big, headded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Salih also advised farmers to grow lemon and orange trees below the date palms to protect the soil and sustain humidity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dates can produce good quality jams. The facutly of agriculture of the University of Khartoum, has been able to produce honey, cakes and jam from the crop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, date palm farming is not without its problems. One of them has to do with how to pollinate and harvest them due to their trmendous heights.  Khairy Ahmed Ali, a director of horticulture, recommends mechanisation using light pollination machines, since experienced climbers were becoming scarce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Date seeds can also produce rich animal fodder. Seeds can be crushed to small pieces and mixed with sorghum and salt to produce rich animal fodder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Doctors also recommend the nuts for patients with chronic constipation.  When softened in a pot containing water all night and taken early in the morning, dates can guarantee easy stooling for these patients, they say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Arab Organisation for Agricultural Development quoting 1993 figures put total annual output of dates at 2,918,000 tonnes.  Iraq is the world's biggest producer with an output of 631,300 tonnes in 1993, followed by Egypt with 613,000 tonnes, Saudi Arabia with 560,000 tonnes and Algeria with 262,000 tonnes.  Other major producers include the Sultanate of Oman (126,000), Morocco (111,100), the organisation said.  In the United States, the state of Indiana is now known to produce good quality dates.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The charge against the Michel Nziguheba was not immediately known.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was arrested in the association's offices where he had gone to complain about the closure of his and six other privately-owned newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The newspapers were suspended by the national Communication Council.  This followed a recent study by the French non-governmental agency, Reporters Without Borders, accusing the newspapers of spreading ethnic hatred and inciting violence in this politically troubled Central African nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nziguheba is the third private print journalist to be arrested. Others are the editors in chief of La Nation, Jean-Marie Bizimana, and Dimas Doweri of La Balance. They have been held for four months.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FREETOWN, Sierra Leone - President-elect Ahmed Kabba, 64, of the Sierra Leone People's Party, will be sworn into office March 29, the country's military ruler said Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a nation-wide radio broadcast, the chairman of the National Provisional Ruling Council and head of state, Brig. Gen. Julius Bio, called on all Sierra Leoneans to support Kaba in establishing democracy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bio said, also, that he would meet Monday in Abidjan, Cote D'Ivoire, with the leader of the rebel Revolutionary United Front, Foday Sankoh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The front had opposed elections and tried to disrupt them in attacks in the first round. However the rebels, who have been trying to overthrow successive administrations in Freetown, declared an uncondiditional ceasefire after Kaba's election Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bio said this was a welcome gesture toward the final end of the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the ruling council has issued Decree No.6, &quot;the idemnity and transition decree 1996.&quot; This indemnifies members of the junta and their agents from any wrongdoing since they assumed office April 29, 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The measure also revokes the proclamation which established the council and serves other connected purposes and will come into effect on the date Kaba assumes office.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe - It was a vote to give legitimacy to the presidency of Zimbabwe but in the end it was also a vote to uphold the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was a thmubs-up vote from the rural peasantry, constituting about 80 percent of Zimbabwe's population and the main beneficiaries of government largesse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was also a protest by urban Zimbabweans who are most affected by government's austere economic reform program launched in 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And when it all ended in Zimbabwe's second presidential elections March 16 and 17, this southern African nation of 10.5 million was back to where it all started 16 years ago: The ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU PF) leader, Robert Mugabe, 72, being declared President for yet another six years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he begins the second and probably his last term standing on a much reduced popularity pedestal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mugabe, who was assured of victory from the start because of a weak and disorganized opposition, spent more than five weeks addressing rallies throughout Zimbabwe imploring his supporters to turn out in their millions in the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am confident that I will win but it is not much of the winning that matters, but that we should turn up in our millions. If there is voter apathy, it will be misinterpreted by the international community,&quot; he said at one rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, some 600,000 people who voted Mugabe into power in 1990 changed their minds this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was a total drop of 1.03 million in the number of people who cast their votes in the presidential elections between 1990 and this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A total of 1.56 million cast their ballots, representing 31.8 percent of registered voters. Of these, 1.4 million or 28.7 percent of registered voters supported Mugabe. However, he received 92.8 percent of valid votes cast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the 1990 presidential elections, some 2.58 million people cast their ballots with 2.03 million or 42.2 percent of registered voters supporting Mugabe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Were it not for recognizing the provisions of the electoral act, the presidential race would have been aborted following the last moment withdrawal of challengers Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole of ZANU (Ndonga) and retired United Methodist Bishop Abel Muzorewa of the United Parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The gospel, according to the two preachers, was that the playing field was uneven and that the constitution governing Zimbabwe was lopsided in favour of the incumbent and his party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, being such a stickler for the law, Mugabe told the nation to regard Sithole and Muzorewa's apparent withdrawal as legally null and void.  Mugabe called on voters to turn out in their thousands to exercise their right and elect a national leader of their choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several hundreds of thousands heeded Mugabe's call in the rural areas.  Since independence in 1980, the countryside has been the target of government-subsidised health services, primary school education and, during recurrent drought periods, free food handouts and agricultural inputs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in the main urban centres, choking with rampant unemployment and poverty due to the debilitating effects of the harsh economic reform programme, only a trickle of party faithfuls trudged to polling stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Muzorewa and Sithole pulled out of the race last week, citing flawed electoral laws and government interference in their operations, their withdrawals were declared invalid as they were made less than 21 days before the first day of polling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the pull out, Muzorewa got 4.8 percent of the valid votes (72,600) while Sithole had 2.4 percent or 36,960 votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This weekend election could signal the last in which the three veteran politicians will participate, judging from their ages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mugabe will be 78 years at the expiry of his term of office. Sithole will be 82 years and Muzorewa 77 years six years from now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But who knows, Zimbabwe might see another presidential contest pitting the three against each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If so, there should be no surprise as Zimbabwe would not be the first country with an octogenarian leader.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cotonou, Benin - Mathieu Kerekou, once head of a Marxist military regime in the West African state of Benin has been elected president of the republic, according to provisional results obtained by PANA in run-off elections held Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kerekou received 59 percent of the total votes cast to defeat incumbent President Nicephore Soglo, a former World Bank official who replced him five years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kerekou, was born Sept. 2, 1933 at Kouarfa in the northwestern Atacora Division of Benin.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kerekou attended Saint-Louis secondary school in northern Senegal and Frejus and Saint Raphael military schools in France. He joined the army and was commissioned in August 1961 as a sub-lieutenant. He became lieutenant the following year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He served as aide-de-camp to the first president of Dahomey (later renamed Benin), Hubert Maga, up to 1963.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kerekou was promoted commander of the 1st Company of the 1st Infantary Battalion of the Benin army from 1963 to 1966.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He participated in a 1967 coup d'etat which overthrew the regime of Christophe Soglo, uncle of the outgoing president Soglo whom Kerekou defeated in run-off presidential elections Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Solgo ousted Kerekou in Benin's first multiparty elections in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Between 1967 and 1968, Kerekou was chairman of the ruling Revolutionary Military Committee, during the military regime in which Lt. Col. Alphonse Alley was head of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1970, Kerekou graduated from the Infantry Staff School in Paris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From 1970 to 1972, he was appointed head of the infantry and in October 1972 he led the coup d'etat which brought him to power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His regime embraced Marxism after mercenaries led by Bob Denard invaded Benin in 1977. Circumstances forced him to drop the ideology in 1990, and later a national conference adopted a new constitution which barred army personnel from holding political office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gen. Kerekou is often referred to as &quot;the Cameleon&quot; because he was fond of repeating the proverb according to which &quot;the cameleon will never break the twig on which its stands&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the national conference, Soglo replaced Kerekou as head of a transition government which prepared for the country's first multiparty elections in more than two decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kerekou was considered &quot;politically dead&quot; after Soglo defeated him by a wide margin in the 1991 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But like the cameleon, Kerekou hibernated in his family home in Cotonou only to surface a few months to the March 3 election when he emerged runner-up to Soglo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He finally won the run-off Monday when two other political partities threw their support behind him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Provisional results released Tuesday by the election commission in Cotonou said he received 59 percent of the total votes cast.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal - The decision of the European Union to subject senegalese fish exports to it new quality standards as from June, has begun to take its toll on the country's fishries industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the fishing companies in Senegal may not be able to meet the new standards for exports to European markets, Dougoutigui Coulibaly, Permanent Secretary General of the Shipowners and Fishries Industries in Senegal (GAIPES) told PANA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These companies, he said, may have to suspended operations pending compliance with European requirements, Coulibaly said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> European Union countries, especially France, Italy, Germany and Spain, received 90 percent of Senegalese exports of sea foods worth more than 100 billion Francs Cfa (about 200, million dollars) in 1995, Coulibaly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is preferable that Senegal decides to temorarily shut a few companies not approved by the EU, rather than lose the entire European market,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of the companies he added may howver never be able to meet the high standards set by the Union, meaning they would be eliminated from exporting products up north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coulibaly acknowledged that the companies were warned in 1989 about the new standards, but added that most of them lacked the financial means to upgrade their operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He cited the case of 'AMERGER' company, which invested one billion CFA francs (about 2 million dollars) in upgrading its operations to meet the standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The measure has also affected the Senegalese Small-Scale fishing since three-quarters of the fish exported come from small fishermen, coulibaly said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cape Verde and Mauritania had even suffered more severe penalties over standards of fish exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Senegalese products are known for their quality and have rarely been rejected in European markets&quot;, he stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The deadline set by the EU, to start implementing sanctions against any country not complying with its standards, is June 1996.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - Nigeria has assured South African business people they have nothingg to fear about travelling to Nigeria to do business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigerian Consul-General in Johannesburg, Adamu Abbas, told members of the Cape Town Chamber of Commerce at a meeting on Monday the fears and anxieties they harboured about doing business in Nigeria were being fully addressed by the Abuja government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria and South Africa resumed diplomatic ties after the 1994 all-race elections that ended apartheid and brought President Nelson Mandela to power.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This raised hope of improved bilateral relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the relations have been strained in the recent past over Nigeria's troubled democratisation process and human rights record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abbas urged the South African business people to contact his office whenever they had doubts about business proposals from Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the Nigerian government had taken &quot;drastic measures about the activitis of a few individuals who try to tarnish the image of the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The envoy said he was in Cape Town to listen the complaints of the businessmen and to &quot;seek ways of helping to deal with matters of trade for the mutual benefit of our two countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many South African bisinesmen have reportedly expressed fears about travelling to Nigeria although they are attracted by the country's business potentials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The businessmen claimed the stories they read about Nigeria were negative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But with the assurances from visiting Nigerian businessmen and Nigerian diplomats in Southern Africa, some of the South African businessmen say they are &quot;now prepared to look at the prospects once again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African High Commissioner in Lagos, George Nene returned to his post last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was one of the foreign envoys recalled for four months over the execution in November 1995 of four minority leaders, among them the author Ken Saro-Wiwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The execution of the men for the 1994 murder of four of their kinsmen in ogoniland, southeastern Nigeria, brought international conddemnation and sanctions on the West African country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - South Africa, which has been described as an emerging market, attracted 5.2 billion U.S.  dollars (20 billion rand) of overseas investment in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The managing director of Cazenove Co.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stock Brokers in London, James Skinner, attributed this success to international goodwill resulting greater political and economic stability since the election of Nelson Mandela's government of national unity in April 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing an investment forum in Lusaka Tuesday, Skinner said South Africa's strengths as an investment site had attracted both short-term portfolio investment and more long-term fixed investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He cited these as significant mineral resources, large pool of accessible labour and diversified and well organised agricultural sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, he said the continuing risk of investing in South Africa could come from the alienation of the Inkatha Freedom Party from the constitutional process and failure to hold elections in Kwazulu Natal and the Western Cape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other risks, he said, were the high rate of crime and violence, lack of commitment to privatisation and administrative failure in a number of regions and problems in central government, particularly with revenue collection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He noted that of the 10 world exchanges that showed the greatest gains in gross domestic product in 1994 six were in Africa: They were Egypt, Ghana and Tunisia which rose more than 100 percent; and Kenya, Morocco and Nigeria which rose to 75 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, he said the problem in these countries remained the lack of liquidity, which was bad in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cazenove, one of the leading London stockbrokers, acts as London broker for some 25 South African companies. It is also broker for Zambia Consolidated Copper Mining Limited.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - The Zambian kwacha continued to deppreciate against major foreign currencies this week, amid fears among currency dealers of further decline during 1996 due to inflation currently running at an annual rate of more than 50 percentt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A forecast published Tuesday by Standard Chartered Commercial Bank said that there was a danger the local currency could continue to fall and adversely affect government's projected six percent growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The kwacha was Tuesday selling for at 1,158 for one U.S.  dollar and at 1,770 for the British pound sterling. The South African rand fetched 295 kwacha at the main Barclays Bank business center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Analysts said Tuesday the irregular hard currency inflows from donors and the generally high demand for foreign currency by local importers had contributed to the presure on the kwacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia has since late 1995 been importing famine relief maize grain to make for the local shortfall caused by drought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finance minister Ronald Penza in January when he presented the 1996 budget forecast six percent growth in the national GDP between now and 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia late last year qualified to borrow under the more favourable Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) of the International Monetary Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Penza has said that the longer repayment periods and lower interest rates under the facility would bring more hard currency available in the country and help to stabilise the kwacha.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - Trading was moderate last week at the six floors of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) where some 6.3 million shares valued at 51.6 million naira changes hands in 1,051 deals (82.5 naira =1 USD).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The figures compared with 11.96 million shares valued at 117.3 million naira in 1,010 deals in the preceding week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Lagos floor recorded a decline with 837 deals for 4.2 million shares worth 37.8 million naira compared with 896 deals in the preceding week for 8.3 million shares valued at 91.4 million naira.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turnover also fell at the Ibadan floor with 300,000 shares valued at 3.1 million naira changing hands in 66 deals as against 1.6 million shares with a market capitalisation of 5.09 million naira in 67 deals in the preceding week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Port Harcourt 34 deals were executed for 60,000 shares worth 900,000 naira, while the turnover in Kaduna stood at 25 deals for 40,000 shares value at 400,000 naira for the week under review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Investors in Onitsha traded 1.3 million shares worth 6.5 million naira in 60 deals as against no transaction in the preceding week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Kano floor recorded 400,000 shares worth 3 million naira in 29 deals compared with the preceeding week's 2 million shares executed in 19 deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Overall, the price movement remained positive as the NSE all-shares index appreciated by 48.95 points to close at 5229.49 in the review period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, activity in the money market was mixed last week with the securities market becoming bullish, while inter-bank market remained sluggish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The open market operations (OMO), where short term security instruments of government are discounted, maintained the upbeat with 6.280 billion naira worth of treasury bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this fell short of the bids which closed at 9.460 billion naira, up by 3.180 billion naira.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three weeks after the release of the guidelines on credit, monetary and exchange policies by the apex bank, lending activity had still to pick up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Analysts blamed the lull in treasury activity on bankers' reservation with the cap on lending and interest rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They say a floating rate is preferred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was indication that some banks have been defying the official interest rate policy, by lending at an average of 35 percent above the statutory maximum of 21 percent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe - Foreign investors, allowed for the first time to participate on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange in June 1993, have so far purchased and sold shares worth over 2.312 billion zimdollars (257 million USD), brokers said on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a commentary, the stockbroking firm Edwards (Amper) Company said the net inflow between June 23, 1993, and the week ending March 8, 1996, was 1.153 billion zimdollars (140.2 million USD).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The company, in a review of the performance of the stock market, said there were indications foreign investors were still in the market as net buyers, amid signs the economy could recover on the back of an improved agricultural season and the mining sector's performance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said there were a lot of foreign-to-foreign deals, particularly in the industrial heavyweights such as Bindura Nickel Corporation, Delta Corporation and PG Industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Edwards said local investors had retreated to the sidelines to digest recent corporate results, and also await new incentives which might emerge after presidential elections held on March 16 and 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over the next few weeks, it said, the movement of the key industrial index, a safe barometer used to gauge the country's economic performance, would be guided by political developments and exchange rate fluctuations, rather than market sentiment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the index could either soar to new heights or downsurge depending on the outcome of the eagerly awaited company results from Delta, its subsidiary Zimbabwe Sun, and the timber production firm PG Timbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimbabwe's stock market, once judged the worst performer among 54 emerging indices surveyed by the International Finance Corporation in 1993, has staged a dramatic recovery, ending 1995 as the third best emerging market for the second year running.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recovery of the stock market, which in 1993 crashed by over 70 percent in value terms, has been boosted by government moves to liberalise investment and exchange controls under market reforms launched over five years ago.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miraw Eshetu, head of the foreign trade section of the bank disclosed Tuesday that the amount earned from 20,750 tonnes of oil seeds and an undisclosed quantity of hides and skins exported from July 1995 to February 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This represented an increase of 23 million dollars compared with earnings from the same products during the same period in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Revenue from oil seeds alone accounted for an increase of 19 million dollars compared with the same period in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The price of sesame seeds went up from 700 dollars to 1,100 dollars during the period and Eshetu attributed the boost in revenue to the hike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thirteen private firms and one state enterprise handled the oil seeds exports, while hides and skins were exported by six government and three private firms.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - President Frederick Chiluba has ordered drastic reduction on the prices of council houses currently on sale by various local authorities to sitting tenants, in a move generally seen as intended to appease the electorate ahead of this year's general elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The houses were being sold under a revived home-ownership scheme initiated by former president Kenneth Kaunda's regime in the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba's Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) government had in 1995 revised the conditions of sale and allowed councils to determine pricing for the various housing units in their respective areas of jurisdiction.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba last week intervened in the sales and accused councils of &quot;exploiting&quot; the public by charging high prices.</SPAN></P>

Most of those houses are old and dilapidated...moreover the tenants have already paid back what had been spent by councils to put up the houses years ago,&quot; he said last Wednesday at a news conference in the capital, Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president is currently touring council housing estates in the northern copperbelt region. Last Saturday, he undertook a similar tour of several council townships in the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some councils, including Lusaka City Council had pegged some of the bigger medium density housing units at 9,000 U.S.  dollars each, and up to 30,000 dollars for those in the low density areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similar houses in the capital, Lusaka, cost between 1, 800 and 4,000 U.S. dollars during the last sales in 1989 when the local currency exchanged at 10 kwacha to one U.S. dollar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba Monday in northern copperbelt town of Chilabombwe suggested that some of the more dilapidated units could be given out &quot;free&quot; to the tenants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Analysts have reported a slump in the housing construction sector over the past several years due to high cost of materials and decline in effective demand for urban housing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ACCRA, Ghana - The Centre for Policy Analysis (CEPA), has called for a holistic approach to the country's management to avoid more negative repercussions in the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CEPA, which is an independent non-governmental body, criticised the government's economic policy management in recent years and said the the policy frameork is flawed for its over-reliance on aggregate demand management to the exclusion of supply enhancement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Launching the 'Macro-Economic Review and Outlook for 1996' in Accra last week, Dr. Joe Abbey, executive director for CEPA, said the prospect for improved economic performance for 1996 remains dim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;CEPA's independent assessment of key macro-economic variables such as the rate of inflation, the exchange rate, the interest rate and real GDP growth rate suggest that the government is more likely to incur a budget deficit for the fiscal year,&quot; Abbey said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Centre, he said, believes that major components of revenue projected by the government in the 1996 budget are out of trend, unidentiflable, unsustainable or unattainable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abbey said average inflation in 1996 will be in excess of 70 percent and the end of year inflation in expected to be in excess of 80 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He explained that weak monetary management by the central bank does not help to keep inflation under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This weak monetary control coupled with strong inertia forces will cause inflation in 1996 to be even more problematic, and if care is not taken to prevent this, the country is likely to end up with a high monetary growth rate with its consequent inflationary ramifications,&quot; Abbey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CEPA projects that the trade deficit of the country will increase from 235.8 million dollars in 1995 to 333.9 million dollars in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It explained that the current account deficit is expected to increase from 1.8 percent of GDP during last year to 2.7 percent in 1996, while the overall balance of payment deficit will rise from 247 million dollars to about 503 million dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Thus, the trend toward declining trade deficits and current account deficit as propositions of GDP experienced over the last two years will be reversed in 1996.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abbey said Ghana's external debt is projected to increase by about 8.4 percent to five billion dollars, a rate not higher than real GDP growth of five per cent, &quot;raising issues of sustainability and future debt burdens&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said 1996 may be worse unless the nation wakes up to the hard realities and signals from the economy and takes decisive and appropriate measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The wide fluctuations in the GDP growth rate and the sharp divergences in sectoral growth patterns during the period of 1990 to 1995, he said, are suggestive of systematic weaknesses, which if not reversed may have dire consequences for future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For instance, he said, the agriculture sector which is vulnerable to weather extremes has seen a decline in its share of GDP during the period with low levels of investment and technological backwardness continue to plague the sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Economic growth has been further constrained by the level of both domestic and foreign savings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As a result of declining incomes, private domestic savings has also been declining, as private households struggle to cope with higher expendittures resulting from higher inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This review and prognosis suggest that we must re-examine our policy framework and directon&quot;, Abbey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He stressed the need to devise and introduce measures to improve the capacity and the ability of the real (agriculture) sector to respond to incentive signals, with enhanced private sector participation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said fiscal discipline must also be an integral part of any genuine development programme, adding that there is the need to re-examine the level and quality of public expenditure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The exchange rate, he said, must be managed to maintain external competitiveness. The said intervention by the central bank to smooth out fluctuations in exchange rate using foreign loans and divestiture receipts is not a viable strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abbey also stressed the need for political parties to subsume short term political gains in favour of long-term national development objectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ghana is regaded as a model of economic structural adjustment and trade liberalisation espoused by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The backbone of its economy is the Ashanti Goalfields Company Limited, which was listed on the New York Stock Exchange last month.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - The manufacturing sector's share of Zambia's total Gross Domestic Product (GDP) fell marginally from 24.7 percent in 1994 to 24.6 percent in 1995, the country's National Commission for Development Planning has said in its 'Economic Report 1995'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report attributed the decline partly to governement's continued trade liberalisation which had increased competition on the local market from cheaper or better imported products.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia's manufacturing industry in 1995 earned some USD 525,000 from USD 550,000 recorded the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the report, only non-metallic mineral products and fabricated metal products had registered increases in their contribution to real output while the basic metal products sub-sector had also stagnated, for the third year running.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among manufacturing sub-sectors which experienced a decline were food, beverages and tobacco, textiles and leather industries, wood and wood products, paper and paper products.  Others included chemicals, rubber and plastic products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) government of president Frederick Chiluba in 1994 enacted &quot;the competition and fair trading act&quot; to regulate trade competition locally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The law is intended to introduce a code of conduct for all business entities and ensure fair competition on the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba's government has been blamed, by the opposition and commercial and industrial sectors, for stiffling local industry since the adoption in 1992 of a free market economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia has been swamped by cheap goods, including textiles and foodstuffs, from especially neighbouring South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African foreign minister Alfred Nzo said during a recent visit that Pretoria was currently trying to balance its trade with Zambia and other neighbouring states. The trade is currently in South Africa's favour.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BADAGRY, Nigeria - Trans-border trade between Nigeria and 15 other countries of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has been paralysed since the February 29 closure of the Nigeria-Benin borders, the official News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) has reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The situation has resulted in &quot;colossal losses&quot; to businessmen and traders in the sub-region, the agency reported, quoting investigations by its reporters from the border town of Badagry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigeria-Benin frontier is a major route for the movement of goods and services within the 16-nation community.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Benin shut its own side of the frontier for four days from February 29 for its presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria, citing &quot;national interest and security reasons,&quot; closed its own side of the borders on the same day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Benin ambassador in Nigeria Jean-Claude Kpakpo told PANA Nigeria had notified his government it was closing the borders &quot;temporarily until further notice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NAN reported that hundreds of travellers from ECOWAS countries were now stranded with their goods at both sides of the border posts following the closure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said a large number of Nigerian importers who use the Cotonou Seaport in Benin were &quot;groaning under accumulated demurrage and freight charges as their goods could not be brought into Nigeria through the borders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the agency, more than 500 imported second-hand vehicles and about 300 trailers loaded with iron rods, cotton, spare parts, grains and textiles are parked at the Benin end of Seme border, while a large quantity of goods bound for Nigeria are still at the Cotonou port.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many of the stranded travellers are camped in mission houses at the border towns of Badagry and Owode, NAN said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It quoted one stranded traveller Mathew Ogundele as saying &quot;this is our third week here and having spent all our money on feeding and other expenses, we don't know when the border will be reopened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ogundele, who said he was travelling to Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire said the Catholic mission in Badagry had provided him and some 200 others free accommodation, while those who could not wait had abandoned the journey.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe - A committee formed last year to promote trade and investment in developing countries began a two-day meeting in Harare on Tuesday, to map out strategies to revive third world economies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The inaugural meeting of the Committee on Investment Trade and Technology (CITT), which was launched in November last year at the G-15 summit of developing countries in Buenos Aires, is expected to come up with recommendations to guide the future of economic co-operation among them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement at the opening ceremony, Zimbabwe's industry and commerce minister, Herbert Murerwa, said the objective of CITT was to broaden and intensify the scope of intra-G-15 economic co-operation, particularly in the areas of the liberalisation, facilitation and promotion of trade, investment and technology.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the two-day deliberations and their outcome would be crucial in setting the tone, direction and impact of the initiative on the future development of economic co-operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main function of the committee, he said, was to serve as &quot;a flexible, consultative, overeaching and trans-regional mechanism to facilitate continuos dialogue&quot; among member countries in the three main areas of trade, investment and technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To perform this function, the CITT would draw extensively from the the work and contributions of existing G-15 projects and structures, Murerwa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Murerwa said establishing priorities for the CITT work programme would not be an easy task as there would be need to avoid duplication on the one hand and establish a limited, focused and business-responsive list of priorities on the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commenting on the current global economic situation, Murerwa said it was characterised by growing interdependence and greater integration among countries of varying levels of development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He noted that effects of globalisation and liberalisation of such areas as production, trade, investment, money and finance, services and technology were increasingly impacting on the member countries' economies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The impact he said, could be both positive and negative, presenting new opportunities for growth and development as well as challenges for the member countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In concluding his speech, he said that while everyone was aware of the objectives of the G-15, it was necessary to define the practical mechanisms and means for achieving the end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this regard, he said, the establishment of the G-15 projects, particularly the South Investment, Trade and Technological Data Exchange Centre (SITTDEC) and the Business and Investment Forum (BIF) represented the member countries' resolve to promote &quot;feasible and meaningful co-operation among the countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The G-15 is a loose coalition of developing countries comprising Argentina, Algeria, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, Mexico, Jamaica, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Senegal, Venezuela, Peru, Nigeria and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KHARTOUM, Sudan - Date palms, introduced in Sudan from Saudi Arabia centuries ago, have fully adapted to the climate and the palms now contribute significantly to the country's food self-sufficiency drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The crop, which usually competes with the minarets of mosques in desert oasis in the race towrad the sky, has been adapted to the humid tropical climate of Equatoria, where temperatures average 40 degrees centrigrade in certian periods and annual rainfalls reach 1,000 cubic millimeters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The date palm fruit is rich in glucose sugar, a fact which explains why muslims use it as starter for Ramdan meals after the day-long fast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Doctors also recommend it for patients with hemoglobin and other blood blood related deficiencies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Experts say a handfull of dates can sustain a human being for six hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dates are also useful as &quot;food nuts&quot; during long travels and periods of famine. If properly sun-dried, hard dates can be preserved for more than twelve months. They can be preserved soft and fresh for more than a year if packaged in polythene bags or tin containers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The number of date palm trees in Sudan is currently estimated at one million, concentrated in the extreme northern part of the country along the River Nile. They produce 100,000 tonnes of dates each year, most of which are consumed locally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The high adaptability of date palms have encouraged farmers to grow them in Darfur State in the extreme West and in the coastal areas of the Red Sea, known to suffer long periods of drought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abdalla Ali, a Khartoum-based farmer says the trees he planted have fully adapted to the weather.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the past I used to harvest my dates during the rainy season but little by little this has changed and I can now harvest them before the rains,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, an Iraqi expert has warned that offshoots should not be left to grow with the mother tree as they will reduce its consumption of food and nitrates and reduce its productivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Salih Muhsin Badr of the Arab Organisation for Agricultural Development working on a project for improving and multiplying date palms in Sudan told PANA &quot;offshoots should be weeded as early as possible because if left to grow they will share the food it obtains from the soil and it will grow weak and fruitless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Sudanese and other African producers should recognize the viabilty of fertilization of date palms to achieve higher yields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Branches should be reduced to the minimum and dry branches should be cut immediately while date clusters should be reduced to let the fruit grow big, headded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Salih also advised farmers to grow lemon and orange trees below the date palms to protect the soil and sustain humidity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dates can produce good quality jams. The facutly of agriculture of the University of Khartoum, has been able to produce honey, cakes and jam from the crop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, date palm farming is not without its problems.  One of them has to do with how to pollinate and harvest them due to their trmendous heights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khairy Ahmed Ali, a director of horticulture, recommends mechanisation using light pollination machines, since experienced climbers were becoming scarce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Date seeds can also produce rich animal fodder. Seeds can be crushed to small pieces and mixed with sorghum and salt to produce rich animal fodder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Doctors also recommend the nuts for patients with chronic constipation.  When softened in a pot containing water all night and taken early in the morning, dates can guarantee easy stooling for these patients, they say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Arab Organisation for Agricultural Development quoting 1993 figures put total annual output of dates at 2,918,000 tonnes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Iraq is the world's biggest producer with an output of 631,300 tonnes in 1993, followed by Egypt with 613,000 tonnes, Saudi Arabia with 560,000 tonnes and Algeria with 262,000 tonnes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other major producers include the Sultanate of Oman (126,000), Morocco (111,100), the organisation said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the United States, the state of Indiana is now known to produce good quality dates.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - The manufacturing sector's share of Zambia's total Gross Domestic Product (GDP) fell marginally from 24.7 percent in 1994 to 24.6 percent in 1995, the government has said in a report on the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report attributed the decline partly to governement's continued trade liberalisation which had increased competition on the local market from cheaper or better imported products.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia's manufacturing industry in 1995 earned some USD 525,000 from USD 550,000 recorded the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the report, only non-metallic mineral products and fabricated metal products had registered increases in their contribution to real output while the basic metal products sub-sector had also stagnated, for the third year running.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among manufacturing sub-sectors which experienced a decline were food, beverages and tobacco, textiles and leather industries, wood and wood products, paper and paper products.  Others included chemicals, rubber and plastic products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) government of president Frederick Chiluba in 1994 enacted &quot;the competition and fair trading act&quot; to regulate trade competition locally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The law is intended to introduce a code of conduct for all business entities and ensure fair competition on the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba's government has been blamed, by the opposition and commercial and industrial sectors, for stiffling local industry since the adoption in 1992 of a free market economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia has been swamped by cheap goods, including textiles and foodstuffs, from especially neighbouring South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African foreign minister Alfred Nzo said during a recent visit that Pretoria was currently trying to balance its trade with Zambia and other neighbouring states. The trade is currently in South Africa's favour.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - The Central Bank of Nigeria announced Monday it has fired 178 bank directors and blacklisted 75 others in connection with sundry abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also said it recovered some 700 million naira from some officials as a result of financial impropriety arising from credits they granted themselves, relatives and companies (82.5 naira =1 USD).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The apex bank did not name the executives concerned but said the move was in pursuance of ongoing efforts to sanitise Nigeria's financial services industry.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 30 commercial banks have been declared insolvent while the operating licences of several others have been revoked in the last one year over financial impropriety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least two executives of the failed banks have been jailed on corruption-related charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A number of other bank executives are awaiting trial, while others have fled the country fearing prosecution under the military government's tough banking decree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The central bank said after a comprehensive review, it was discovered that many insider credits were &quot;delinquent and non-performing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Consequently,&quot; it added, &quot;after due process and fair hearing, sanctions including removal of the defaulting directors and blacklisting from appointment into the boards of institutions under the bank's supervisory preview, have been imposed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said that insiders, who failed to settle loans or engaged in malpractices would be brought before a bankruptcy tribunal for debt recovery or criminal sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The apex bank said the exercise would be a continuous one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a related development, the Nigerian Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC), which runs the local capital market, has withdrawn the licence of a stock broking firm and suspended 20 others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Commission said it revoked the registration certificate of Majestic Securities Ltd because of the firm's alleged failure to render accounts of the public offer on 10 issues in which it had acted as agent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the first major move at implementing government's pledge to sanitise the capital market, the Commission also said the stock broking firm was being penalised for alleged inability to renew its registration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission said investigation on the activities of the company revealed that proceeds from an oil company for public offer of 57.5 million naira and 30 million naira ordinary shares for public subscription and rights issue respectively were unremitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SEC accused the stockbroking firm of compromising professional ethics by issuing dud cheques.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Commission warned investors against transacting capital market business with the company and the suspended stockbroking firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to brokers, the affected firms have either been declared distressed or have had their operations trimmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEW YORK, United Nations - The United Nations launched an appeal for 57 million U.S. dollars to address humanitarian needs in Sierra Leone, where an election concluded Sunday to return the nation to civilian rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) said the money would be used by the United Nations and non-governmental organizations to provide relief assistance to people displaced or affected by the country's five-year civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations raised about 10 million dollars for the recent elections in the West African country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The DHA said the latest appeal, to last until February 1997, would cover programs in food aid and production, health and nutrition, non-food aid, assistance to children, education, demobilization, and coordination of humanitarian assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The emergency in Sierra Leone is occurring within the broader context of a country undergoing structural adjustment, seeking long-term development and moving towards democratic governance,&quot; it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is foreseen that emergency programs will be required for the remainder of 1996,&quot; the agency said, &quot;in order to sustain those worst affected by the crisis and to stabilize the areas of the country that can be reached by relief and development organizations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The civil war between the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and the military government in Freetown has forced about 2.1 million people to abandon their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations estimates that 1.6 million people are internally displaced while about 370,000 fled to neighboring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council Tuesday congratulated Sierra Leone for successfully holding Saturday's runoff presidential elections, in which Ahmed Tejan Kabbah of the Sierra Leone's Peoples Party emerged winner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Its president, Botswana's Legwaila Legwaila, called on the RUF to accept the elections' result and enter into peace talks with the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The council also called on the international community to provide the country with humanitarian assistance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNITED NATIONS, New York - Some American nationals, embarrassed by their country's huge debt to the United Nations, have started mailing checks to the organization to reduce the arrears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States owes more to the United Nations than any other country, 1.6 billion dollars of the total 3.1 billion dollars owed to the world body.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The arrears are for regular and peacekeeping contributions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A number of Americans, who believe their country should pay its dues, have sent in cheques of 4.4 dollars each. The amount is what each U.S.  citizen would pay if the debt were divided among the American population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A U.N. spokesman, Ahmed Fawzi, said Tuesday 462 checks had been received so far from more than 1,047 Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are still receiving letters (and checks) from U.S. citizens who wish to make their small contributions to the U.S. debt,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fawzi said although the total amount of contributions as of March 18 was less than 6,500 dollars, &quot;it is very much appreciated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The local newspaper in the small U.S. town of New Canaan even ran an advertisement from 33 residents announcing their contributions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only 41 of the 185 U.N. member-states have paid their assessed contributions to the organization this year, a situation that has put the organization in its worst financial situation since it was founded more than 50 years ago.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MAPUTO, Mozambique - Mozambique's Geology and Mines Directorate recommended the sealing off of areas in the northwestern city of Tete, where containers of radioactive material have been found, to prevent any harm to members of the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wednesday's issue of the Maputo daily paper 'Noticias' reported that the directorate sent a team to analyze the radioactive waste.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A geophysical survey was also undertaken in the area where the waste was dumped. Samples taken will be analyzed further in Maputo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The material was discovered at Chingozi and Nhambira on the outskirts of Tete. It had been used for geophysical work in the coal mining industry but was abandoned in the mid-1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The discovery was immediately communicated to the ministries of energy and mineral resources, and of environmental coordination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Branquinho Nhombe, head of the Tete Provincial Mineral Resources Directorate, added that until the results of the survey are known, the directorate will take preventive measures by posting signs warning passers-by to avoid the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nhombe said the province does not have the financial or technical means to render the material safe. He hoped non-governmental organizations who operate in this part of the country would provide aid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KAMPALA, Uganda - Four candidates, including the incumbent, Yoweri Museveni, are set to contest Uganda's presidential elections this May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni will run as chairman of the ruling National Resistance Movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another candidate is the Democratic Party president-general Paul Semwogerere, who will run as the joint candidate of the Inter-Party Cooperation, an alliance of several Ugandan political parties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other two are the little-known Herman Ssemujju and Mohammed Mayanja, an academic whose bid to contest the presidential elections was known only this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The aspirants were issued their nomination papers Tuesday in Kampala by the chairman of Uganda's interim electoral commission, Stephen Akabway. The documents were received by the candidates' campaign managers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officially, the elections are to be held under a &quot;no party system&quot; whereby candidates stand as independents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition candidates have complained this system favors Museveni, who has a well-structured organization of which he was the candidate in the multiparty polls of 1981.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The aspiring candidates will have to obtain 100 signatures of supporters in each of the country's districts before they can officially become presidential candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Akabway said no person must intimidate, threaten or harass the aspiring presidential candidates' campaign agents as they mobilize to collect the signatures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The presidential campaign formally begins on March 29.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The election will be the first since Museveni and his National Resistance Army shot their way to power in January 1986 after a five-year guerilla war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda's last multiparty polls were held in 1981, two years after a combined force of Ugandan exiles and Tanzanian troops dislodged Gen. Idi Amin, the dictator who had ruled the East African country from January 1971.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni took up arms shortly after those Commonwealth- observed elections, amid claims that they were flawed in favor of Milton Obote.  Obote's force was the largest in the effort to topple Amin.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MONROVIA, Liberia - Military chiefs from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) resolved Tuesday to adhere strictly to the peace accord signed in 1995 by Liberia's warring factions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting of military chiefs is only the second since the Abuja Accord was signed Aug. 17, 1995, and comes at a time when the peace process is on the verge of collapse as rebel forces reportedly are nearing the capital, Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a news conference after the two-day meeting, the community's executive secretary, Edouard Benjamin, said the peace plan designed by the 16 ECOWAS nations was working, but with difficulty.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Military chiefs from 11 of the 16 states attended the conference. Those who did not show were from Benin, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania and Togo. No reason was given for their absence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting reviewed the conflicts in Liberia and neighboring Sierra Leone -- where a rebellion in Sierra Leone sprouted from the Liberian war -- and what ECOWAS could do to bring the Liberian peace process back on track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fighting between some Liberian factions continues to endanger the peace process. Fighters are supposed to allow the West African peacekeeping force, ECOMOG, to deploy throughout the country, disarm the factions, then canton them before elections are held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Benjamim said difficulties in implementing the accord lay with factors beyond their control. This could refer to the international community's unwillingness to provide logistics for ECOMOG to fan out throughout Liberia, patrol its borders to prevent weapons smuggling, and provide a peaceful environment within.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Benjamin said ECOWAS would help provide the right climate to resolve the six-year conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ECOMOG Field Commander Maj. Gen. John Inienger described as &quot;unfortunate&quot; the recent occupation of the town Kakata by rebels from National Patriotic Front of Liberia. He said his staff was studying the reported rebel advance toward Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The peacekeepers withdrew from the town of Tubmanburg after they were ambushed there in December 1995 by one of the warring groups that seized heavy weapons from the peacekeepers and left many dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inienger, a Nigerian army general, said his troops would not go back to Tubmanburg unless the weapons were returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Witnesses fleeing Kakata said despite orders to withdraw from rebel leader Charles Taylor, now a member of Liberia's ruling six-man Council of State, his men had continued to rape, loot, and terrorize residents. It is unclear whether Taylor still has complete control of his forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other fleeing Kataka residents said the rebels' marine forces were the unit that attacked the town. They have gained notoriety for their &quot;viciousness, lust and greed.&quot; The town now is deserted as residents seek refuge in the Booker Washington Institute where ECOMOG has its base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rebels also occupied Bensonville, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Kakata and about 32 kilometers (20 miles) from Monrovia. They have also taken White Plains, about 11 kilometers (seven miles) outside the capital.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> COTONOU, Benin - Benin's autonomous National Electoral Commission Tuesday night said the election results announced earlier in the day, which declared former president Mathieu Kerekou the winner, were not official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement on Monday's second round presidential polls, the commission said the results, published by several international news organs, had not yet been confirmed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The document entitled &quot;Clarification on the Results Released by the National Institute for Statistics and Economic Analysis&quot;, was read to journalists by the commission's chairman, Leopold Dossou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dossou said although the institute and the commission were jointly involved in the computer processing of election data, the institute is not charged with the actual organizing or publication of the results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The commission informs local and international opinion that as at Tuesday March 19, 1996, at 4 p.m., it does not yet possess adequate information to be able to release complete provisional results for any of the six districts in the country,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dossou told the journalists that he had just been given written confirmation of provisional results for the southeastern Mono District, where Kerekou won 122,706 votes against 95,200 for the incumbent Nicephore Soglo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dossou added that he also had the provisional results of seven out of 14 sub-districts in the central Zou district. These were in favour of Soglo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, supporters of Soglo denounced Tuesday night what they claimed was &quot;manipulation of information&quot; in favor of his adversary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Provisional results placed Kerekou ahead of Soglo. They said Kerekou had 59 percent of the ballots. However, estimates published later indicated the general had won with 52.84 percent of the votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The final results are expected to be issued by the country's Constitutional Court after it reviews the entire provisional results provided by the electoral commission.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - Three Nigerians and a Briton Tuesday in Lagos received the 'Jimmy and Rosalyn Carter' awards for helping to reduce the spread of guineaworm in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The awards were given Wednesday, the eve of the International Guineaworm Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first award -- a plaque and an undisclosed sum of money -- went to Colins Davis, an employee of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A disabled retired Nigerian civil servant, A.K. Salami, was named the second recipient. He was recognised for being in the vanguard of Nigeria's guineaworm eradication campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A fresh university graduate, Lola Olopade, and a programme officer, Niran Fatinilu, were the other award recipients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The awards were given at a ceremony to celebrate Nigeria's success reducing of its guineaworm cases by 97 percent over the past eight years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The awards bear the names of former United States president Jimmy Carter and his wife, who have led the drive against the debilitating disease, especially in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former U.S. leader and his 'Global 2000' have been in the forefront of guineaworm eradication efforts in Nigeria and other African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Davis was praised for backing with &quot;technical assistance and substantial financial resources&quot; cooperation with the Nigeria Guineaworm Eradication Programme (NIGEP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The awards were introduced by Carter as an incentive to hasten the complete eradication of guineaworm globally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similar awards were also presented to six states and Abuja, the Nigerian capital, which recorded no guineaworm cases by 1995, the previous eradication target date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria reduced its cases of guineaworm from 653,620 from 1988 to about 15,000 cases in Dec. 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the Nigerian health minister Ihechukwu Madubuike said Tuesday in Lagos that financial and political commitments were essential for a successful eradication of the disease in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said there must be increased funding, effective supervision, sustained high surveillance and the provision of potable water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The minister urged greater co-operation from within and outside the country for the achievement of the goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If we must truly develop and turn our rural areas to economically viable entities, the problems of guineaworm and other endemic diseases must be adequately addressed,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria, with some 100 million people, is second in the World Health Organisation's ranking of 18 countries that have the debilitating disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sudan leads the group with some 60,000 cases. These are mainly found in the country's south, where a civil war has been going on since 1983.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ACCRA, Ghana - The global threat posed by the AIDS calls for emergencies to address the challenging task of bringing about a change in the lifestyles of populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The world is still a long way from discovering a cure for HIV, the virus which causes aids, and even if one is found now, new treatments need to be tested for safety and effectiveness at several stages before they can be licenced for use. The same applies to the discovery of a vaccine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Dr. Peter Piot, Executive Director of the joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, &quot;the world-wide epidemic of AIDS is one of the major tragedies of our time.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The HIV epidemic, now in its second decade, continues to grow...at a rate of over 6,000 new infections every day, and the resulting sickness and death from AIDS continue to wreak unprecedented havoc among individuals, families and societies,&quot; says Dr. Piot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He warns that no country will be able to able to insulate itself from the shock waves of HIV/AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In view of these factors, the Ghanaian government has been urging the population, especially workers, to adopt healthier lifestyles that will help check the epidemic's spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is because statistics show that about 80 percent of Ghana's 15,600 AIDS victims are aged between 19 and 45 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even this is an under-estimate. The Ministry of health in Accra says that the official number of aids cases is only a small figure of those affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consequently, the ministry has been urging workers to discuss and take action that will protect them and other support activities they can offer to other to protect themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ministry has been doing so by encouraging workers to help their collegues who already have the virus as way of controlling its spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It advises that once a worker has AIDS he should be placed on light duties to enable him or her seek medical attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has to pay for the medical bills, and if he is self-employed he loses his income during the treatment period. If the patient works with the government or a private company, the employer pays the bills, loses money and loses man hours leading, to a fall in productivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the patient is married, the partner may stay away from home at various times to take care of the needs of his spouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Profit will be affected thus affecting the national economy as the company's tax will also be reduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AIDS is expected to cost Ghana a lot of skilled and semi-skilled workers who will need to be replaced. Recruiting and training of staff to replace those lost to AIDS will be time consuming and costly as money will go into the education/training of the new employee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, employers have lost a lot of man hours due to AIDS. Once an AIDS patient dies, a number of workers will always stay away from work to attend to the funeral, thus affecting productivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In spite of this, many Ghanaians appear to be indifferent to the AIDS pandemic because they have not seen an AIDS patient. A lot of people have various impressions about the incurable disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some even go to the extent of blaming some journalists the health authorities of making too much noise about the illness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their jargon is &quot;every die be die&quot;, whether it is from malaria, an accident or AIDS you will be gone for ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To justify the multiplicity of sexual partners, the common remark is: &quot;What if I decide to have some palm nut soup after taking light soup for a long time?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such statements show the need for intensive and effective workplace educational programmes to help workers avoid behaviour patterns that open them to infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both management and workers should develop an effective response to the anti-aids campagign and develop programmes on aids counselling, medical care and social support for their employees, families and other people in their local communities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BANJUL, Gambia - World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for Africa Dr Ebrahim Samba has endorsed the ban imposed by the Gambian military government on skin-bleaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing a news conference in Banjul on March 16, Samba, who is Gambian and once served as his country's medical director, described the decision as &quot;a very good move.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Capt. Yahya Jammeh's Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council has effective January 1996 banned skin-bleaching, which was gaining increased popularity among women in this tiny West African state with a population of about one million people.  Samba said that he had, in his capacity as director of medical services, spoken out against the practice and had seen people suffer and die as a result of skin bleaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the Gambia News Agency (GAMNA), the regional director described the government's action as not so much an act of banning but a step towards the &quot;protection of our sisters, mothers and wives&quot; from harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Skin bleaching &quot;is a very dangerous practice&quot;, Samba said at a news conference held at the WHO office in Banjul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WHO Regional Director was in Banjul to review preparations for a forthcoming roundtable between Gambian health authorities and donors to be held in August.  Four WHO consultants have been in Banjul since the beginning of March working with Gambian officials on the proposed donors' conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Samba arrived in the Gambian capital from Dakar, Senegal, where he insisted, during another news conference, on the need for African countries to effectively fund their own health requirements instead of waiting for donors.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal - The international community observes the first World Tuberculosis Day Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The event is being held to commemorate the day TB bacillus, the agent that causes the disease, was discovered by a German microbiologist Dr Robert Koch in 1882.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To draw attention to the TB crisis, which will kill some 3 million people in 1996 alone, the World Health Organization (WHO) Director General Dr Hiroshi Nakajima on Tuesday launched a week of TB Day activities in Osaka, Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This will be followed by the publication in London on Thursday of the WHO report on the 'Tuberculosis Epidemic 1996' at a news conference.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two events are scheduled to take place in Africa as part of the World TB week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first of these will take place Thursday at Nigeria's Nnamdi Azikiwe University in Nnewi, eastern Nigeria. It will be a seminar to appraise the current knowledge of TB.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Cape Town, South Africa, Bishop Desmond Tutu, a former TB patient, will officiate at a special service at Guguletu Sports Complex on March 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TB is transmitted from person to person by bacilli spread into the air when a patient with active pulmonary tuberculosis coughs, sneezes or even talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It can also be spread through consumption of contaminated unpasturized milk or dairy products. This mode of transmission occurs mainly among farmers and animal handlers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the WHO, there is a resurgence of TB because of limited use of the effective drugs developed after Koch's discovery of the disease's causing germ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As a result, TB has sent at least 200 million people to their graves since 1882,&quot; said the UN health agency in a pre- World TB Day advisory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Worse still is the emergence of multi-drug resistant TB strains that &quot;are threatening to make the disease incurable for future generations,&quot; said the WHO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was only in the 1940s that anti-tuberculosis drugs were discovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These were mainly drinkable or injectable anti-biotics such as streptomycin and ethambutol and several others which have been placed on the WHO list of essential drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Complete treatment of TB patients costs between 15 and 40 USD, which is unfortunately beyond the reach of the majority in Africa where access to elementary health care is often poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Drug resistant TB strains are emerging mainly due to poor diagnosis and because patients do not adhere to the prescriptions given to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The result is the hardening of the TB bacillus against prescribed drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Poor diagnosis and a failure to stick to prescriptions can make TB patients chronic sufferers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the WHO African regional office in Brazzaville, Congo, 600,000 TB-related deaths occur in the region each year. This represents a fifth of all TB-caused deaths worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regional WHO office says 1.5 million cases are registered on the continent every year. Of these, 300,000 are found in those also infected with HIV, the virus believed to cause Aids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TB is now said to account for 40 percent of mortality among Africa's AIDS patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The HIV-TB infected persons react very poorly to certain anti-TB drugs, Thiocetazone in particular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WHO experts in Brazzaville fear that up to 10 million Africans could die of TB due to inadequate treatment in the next decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most efficient treatment is currently a combination of drugs which not only prevent the spread of TB infection but also prevent the emergence of drug-resistant bacillus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The method is known as directly-observed treatment, short course (DOTS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this method requires a strict follow-up of patients for six to eight months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Diagnosis and adequate treatment and systematic vaccination of children against TB considerably reduce the risk of mortality. However, TB thrives most among migrants, aged people, AIDS carriers and alcoholics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WHO has encouraged the media to carry the anti-TB message beyond the World TB day to raise public awareness on the gravity of the TB situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has urged its partners to mobilise further resources to combat the disease.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KINSHASA, Zaire - Fifteen members of the Zairean Bar Association offered to give free legal services to an undetermined number of poverty-striken people injured when a plane plunged into a central Kinshasa market early this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Russian-made plane failed to take-off from an airport located near a big market in the Zairean capital on Jan. 8.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The aircraft sped into the market, killing nearly 300 people and injuring at least 250 others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some accident victims are still undergoing treatment in Kinshasa's health centers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lawyers will appear on behalf of the victims when the case reopens Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The association said it will give legal assistance to the plaintiffs upon presentation of a document confirming their inability to pay legal fees.  The certificates are issued by local council authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among those affected are civil servants who are regarded as poor, given their low incomes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Appearing in the case are two Russian pilots, the operator of the plane, African Air, and 'Scibe-Air-Lift', which hired out the 'Antonov 32' aircraft to the Zairean Civil Aviation Authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the hearing started March 4, defense lawyers protested the ommission of the Zairean government from the list of the defendants citing its &quot;heavy responsibility&quot; in the disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The case was postponed for three weeks to enable all the interested parties prepare their cases.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNITED NATIONS, New York - The United Nations is sending a three-member fact-finding mission to Nigeria next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A U.N. spokesman, Ahmad Fawzi, said Wednesday the team, scheduled to leave on March 27, would address itself to &quot;two issues of concern&quot; to the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the delegation will examine &quot;the trial and execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and others, including the judicial procedures of the trial in the context of the various international human rights instruments to which Nigeria is a party and of relevant Nigerian law.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The plans of the government of Nigeria to implement its declared commitment to restore the country to democratic rule,&quot; is the other issue to be examined, Fawzi added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mission includes Atsu Koffi Amega, Togo's former foreign minister and member of the African Commission on Human and People's Rights, based in Banjul, Gambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The others are Justice V.S. Malimath, a member of the National Human Rights Commission of India, and John Pace, chief of the legislation and prevention of discrimination branch, at the U.N. Center for Human Rights in Geneva, Switzerland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mission will be accompanied by Amer Araim, a senior political affairs officer in the U.N. department of political affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria has come under international pressure for its troubled democratization process and human rights record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The execution Nov. 10, 1995, of author Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni minority-rights leaders on charges of murdering four of their kinsmen in 1994, unleashed international condemnation and sanctions against the populous West African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Upon completion of its work, the group will submit a report to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the duration of the visit, Fawzi said: &quot;As long as it takes, we don't have a time frame.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fawzi said the mission was being sent at the request Nigeria's government and in in accordance with a December 1995 General Assembly resolution asking the secretary-general to undertake discussions with the Nigerian government and to report on the progress in the implementation of the resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sponsored by the United States and the European Union, it condemned what it called the &quot;arbitrary execution&quot; of Saro-Wiwa and the eight others who were found guilty of the murder of four Ogoni leaders opposed to their movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The resolution also expressed concern about &quot;other violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Nigeria&quot; and urged the government to take immediate and concrete steps to restore democratic rule.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FREETOWN, Sierra Leone - Six of the 13 political parties that presented candidates in legislative elections held in Sierra Leone in February have gained seats in parliament, according to final results released by the election commission chairman, James Jonah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The six parties were able to obtain the required five percent of the total votes cast in the polls held on February 26 and 27 to gain seats in parliament, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the results, the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP) received 269,888 votes or 36 percent to gain 27 seats.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United National People's Party (UNPP) followed with 165,219 votes or 22 percent to gain 17 seats, while the People's Democratic Party (PDP) with 114,429 votes or 15 percent of the votes, gained 12 seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The All People's Congress (APC) which received 42,467 votes or 6 percent, gained five seats, the Natioanal Unity Party (NUP) with 39,285 votes and 5 percent, gained four seats while the Democratic Centre Party (DCP) with 35,632 votes or 5 percent, gained three seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jonah's report showed 750,858 people nationwide voted for 68 parliament seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was regional balance in the distribution of seats with the three parties based in the north -- UNPP, PDP and APC -- collecting 34 seats, the same number as the three south-eastern oriented parties, SLPP, NUP and DCP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Twelve paramount chiefs, one from each district, were also elected to parliament by local chiefdom councillors on a non-patry basis, thus bringing the total membership of parliament to eighty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, in the presidential run-off poll of March 15 which elected Ahmad Tejan Kabba of the SLPP, voter turn-out was 1,044,158 or 70 percent of the national electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were 1,028,851 were valid votes from a total of 1,496,749 registered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were a number of compaints of irregularities which, Jonah said, were not made public because of the understanding and reconciliation shown by the various political leaders.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MONROVIA, Liberia - The High Command of the West African peacekeeping force in Liberia has asked one of several rebel factions in the country to pull out of areas recently declared safe havens to facilitate the return of civil administration in the affected areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The command said Wednesday now only its troops will be allowed to carry arms in these havens.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The peacekeeping group, known by its acronym ECOMOG, said it was concerned that the National Patriotic Front of Liberia had continued to occupy the locations of Kakata, Todee and Bong Mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rebel action, it said, &quot;led to the displacement of thousands of unarmed civilians whose only hope lies in an end to the carnage that the civil war has brought to the Liberian people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ECOMOG emphasized the need for all parties to the conflict to abide by the Abuja agreement which they signed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About two weeks ago, the front attacked and overran another splinter faction, ULIMO-J, from the three locations. Then, the front lost the ground to the main ULIMO body during &quot;Operation Octopus&quot; launched by the front to complete its military conquest of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reason given by the front's leader, Councilman Charles Taylor, for his attacks was to keep the road to the interior of the country open. Taylor said his troops wanted to ensure free movement of civilians and ensure constant supply of food and other commodities to residents of Monrovia, the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nevertheless, the fighters continue to occupy the areas and even to set up bases several kilometers beyond Kakata, Bong Mines and Todee, posing a threat to the entire peace proces.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia - The Organization of African Unity (OAU) said Thursday it is extending the mandate of its Observer Mission to Burundi for only one month &quot;due to financial constraints.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burundi had asked the mission be extended by 58 more observers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">It had also asked for a six month extension of its mandate, which expires at the end of March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mission's mandate was extended for three months late last December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a prepared statement, the OAU secretariat said the decision to extend the mandate would be reviewed by a summit of the OAU's 16-nation Central Mechanism on Conflict Management, to be held April 15-16 in Addis Ababa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The extension was made by the conflict management body's meeting at the ambassadorial level at the request of the Burundi government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The continental body maintains a token observer mission of 40 military and 30 civilian personnel in the central African state, rocked by ethnic violence since October 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The violence, between the majority Hutu population and the minority Tutsi, was sparked by the assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye on Oct.  21, 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was killed by Tutsi soldiers who constitute the majority in the Burundian army. This led to revenge killings by Hutus against Tutsis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burundi has vehemently resisted a proposal by United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to send in an international force to stop the violence that has led to between 50,000 and 100,000 deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The violence has also forced thousands of Burundians into exile in neighboring countries, especially Zaire.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group, has launched a campaign for the release of the two 'Post' newspaper editors jailed by the Zambian parliament for alleged contempt of the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A statement from Amnesty in London, quoted by the Post Thursday, said the organization had launched a campaign to alert the international community of the editors' plight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amnesty adopted the two, post managing director and editor-in-chief Fred M'membe and managing editor Bright Mwape as &quot;prisoners of conscience.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amnesty said it feared the Zambian government would abduct and torture the detainees, given the admission by the government's own commission of enquiry that torture remains a widespread practice by Zambian police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> M'membe and Mwape have been in detention since March 4. Zambian speaker Robinson Nabulyato in February sentenced the two to &quot;indefinite&quot; incarceration for alleged contempt and breach of parliamentary privileges in newspaper articles the Post had published in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of M'membe and Mwape...Both are prisoners of conscience being held for the peaceful expression of their criticism of the Zambian government,&quot; the organization said in the statement quoted by the Post Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Post chief legal counsel Sakwiba Sikota last week claimed that state security agents had planned to &quot;abduct&quot; his clients, allegedly for torture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambian police have said that M'membe is being held in the capital, Lusaka, while Mwape is being held in the midlands town of Kabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sikota has since petitioned the high court for the state to show cause why it should continue to hold the two editors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Post columnist Lucy Sichone, who was sentenced along with M'membe and Mwape on similar charges, is still at large. Sources within the government said last week in newspaper reports that they believed she had taken refugee in neighboring Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A human rights commission of enquiry appointed late in 1995 found evidence of police torture both during the previous regime of former President Kenneth Kaunda and that the practice had continued since President Frederick Chiluba's government came to power in 1991.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TRIPOLI, Libya - The World Bank has warned about the threat of water scarcity in Northern Africa and the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a report published last Friday in Maghreb countries on the occasion of the world water day, the bank said 45 million prople or 16 percent of the region's population in the region have no access to adequate quantities of drinking water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The situation has deteriorated from 1960 when each inhabitant in the region had at least 3,360 cubic metres of water per year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last year, the amount dwindled to 1,250 cubic metres and if the appropriate steps are not taken, this could be reduced by half in the next decade, or 600 cubic metres per year and per person by the year 2,025.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the World Bank, the water scarcity partly results from the region's high population growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The number of people has, indeed, doubled over the last 30 years and has reached 280 million individuals. It could double in the next 30 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the water is also the result of wasteful use of existing water resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For instance, 87 percent of the water in the region is used for irrigation. This leaves only 13 percent for human consumption and industry, compared with 31 percent in the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Due to inadequate water, a resident of Gaza has access to 57 litres of water a day while an American in the same day can use up to 3,040 litres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Bank proposes several remedial measures including a transnational partnership strategy between the countries in the region and national strategies involving the private and public sectors, as well as donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bank said that an investment of 50 billion U.S dollars was required to deal with the region's water scarcity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This has to be raised by the concerned countries and by donors.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - Biologically diverse freshwater ecosystems and fish species are threatened or disappearing in &quot;every part of the world,&quot; says a report by an American research group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A report by the Worldwatch environment research organisation said fish species in East Africa's Lake Victoria and other parts of Africa are threatened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report published Monday by the U.S state department's 'Washigton Line,&quot; quoted its author Janet Abramovitz as saying that 20 percent of the world's 9,000 fish species were now either extinct or in danger of becoming extinct.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the report, 60 percent of Lake Victoria's 350 native fish species were extinct and the remaining 150 species were at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Africa, fish provide 21 percent of the total animal protein, according to the study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Even more alarming is the fact that extinction rates today are about 100 to 1000 times higher than before humans existed. So what we're doing is running a biodiversity deficit -- we're destroying species and ecosystems faster than nature can create new ones,&quot; said Abramovitz in her report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said that since the beginning of the century about 10 percent of the species had become extinct and the rest were in jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is a problem of global importance. These unassuming little creatures (fish) are very important. They sit in one spot and they filter and clean vast quantities of water.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said that the numerous problems had also been caused by overconsumption of water for irrigation purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An estimated 30 out of 47 commercial fish species in the River Nile had become economically or biologically extinct, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lake Chad, in Africa's Sahel region had shrunk by 75 percent in the last 30 years due to drought and water diversion for agriculture, to the detriment of important inland fisheries and the people reliant on its diverse resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lake Victoria had been cited as suffering from the effects of an introduced species &quot;the Nile perch&quot; which is said to be &quot;conspiring with changing land use, pollution and growing population pressures.&quot; The Nile perch has been said by marine scientists to have eaten up most of the local fish species in the lake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other pressures on the lake's ecosystem include untreated sewage and industrial waste flowing in from Kisumu, Kenya's third largest city and from Mwanza, Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Watershed degradation and agricultural runoff also contributed chemicals, nutrients and sediment in addition to the &quot;grisly addition of 40,000 genocide victims that floated down the Kagera river in May 1994,&quot; said the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Lake Victoria, a major cooperative effort among Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, is in the pipeline to focus on water quality, land use management, control of the exotics (fish species) and water hyacinth and community-based enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cooperation by the three East African countries may restore Lake Victoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is also need for preserve the less-degraded Lakes Malawi and Tanganyika, said Abramovits who added that many of today's problems resulted from &quot;short-sighted&quot; and fragmented attempts to improve on nature such as introducing the varacious Nile perch at Lake Victoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Both the concept of sustainability and the nature of ecosystems require that decisions affecting them look not only beyond the next few years but beyond the next decades as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Regional efforts like those around...Lake Victoria that set long-term goals and include all countries are starting to reflect this reality.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal - The Commissioner of the Organization for the Development of the Senegal River (OMVS) Baba Ould Andallah says the three member states have so far not exploited their common infrastructure to the maximum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abdallah said in an interview that with the Diama Dam, which became operational in 1986, the member states -- Mali, Mauritania and Senegal -- could have attained food self-sufficiency through irrigated agriculture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that in spite of new health problems and changes in the ecosystems for which solutions are being sought or implemented, there was proof that the completed projects were likely to benefit member states a great deal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the commission, Senegal has exploited less than 50,000 hectares out of the 240,000 hectares that have been made arable since the Diama Dam was constructed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the other hand, Mauritania does not exploit more than 25,000 hectares out of the 120,000 hectares available while Mali has never used more than 18,000 hectares made available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commissioner conceded that Mali was getting comparatively less benefits from the Diama Dam, which cost 14 million U.S. dollars to construct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, he said, Mali's financial contribution to the OMVS will be reduced during the organization's next extraordinary ministerial session scheduled for July this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abdallah said from now on charges and costs of joint projects will be distributed equally between the organization's member states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Abdallah said a hydro-electric power station will be constructed at the Manantali Dam in Mali before the end of this financial year. It will supply the three countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mali is expected to be the major beneficiary. It will draw 51 percent of the 800 million kilowatts to be generated each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the hydro-electric power station is expected to cost 400 million US dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Manantali, constructed at a cost of 200 million U.S dollars, is the OMVS's biggest dam since the three-nation organisation was created in 1972.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The OMVS high commissioner said studies were underway to develop all-year navigation on the Senegal River at a cost of 70 million U.S dollars.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report said 16 percent of the population of the region or 45 million people do not have access to potable water.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1960, people residing in North Africa and the Middle-East had at least 3,360 cubic metres of water per year.  Last year, the figure fell by half to only 1,250. Projections are that this will futher drup to 600 cubic metres by 2025.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bank attributes this situation to rising population, saying the number of people living in the region has doubled to 280 million in 30 years, with projections of two times this number by the next generations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rising population apart, the bank has also faulted wastage as part of the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, 87 percent of the water collected in this region is devoted to irrigation, leaving only 13 percent for industrial and household use, compared to a world average of 31 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This explains why one inhabitant of Gaza in the Middle East has 57 litres of water per day when his American counterpart uses 3,040 litres in 24 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report suggests series of measures including a transnational partnership strategy involving countries of the region, the public and private sectors as well as donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Naturally such common action would depend on mutual understanding between governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bank projects that some 50 billion dollars would have to be invested on water projects in the next 10 years to improve the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Donor countries and the World Bank could contribute 15 billion dollars of the total amount, it said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the end of their two-day workshop in Harare Friday, the experts issued a statement saying that they recognised the potential for new approaches to promoting development, focusing on such areas as agro-forestry and eco-tourism.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As such, they are key mechanisms to address ... poverty alleviation and sustainable development in southern Africa,&quot; said the statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among other conclusions, delegates agreed that desertification, land degradation, water problems and drought preparedness were &quot;among the key development challenges facing this region,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Participants recognised the need and potential for participatory approaches to improve the quality of development programming within the region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The workshop was designed to facilitate discussion on such key issues as desertification and land degradation, agro-forestry and transboundary water issues, and was jointly organised by the Canadian International Development Agency and the Japanese International Co-operation Agency.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - The Zambian kwacha has continued to depreciate against major foreign currencies, dropping by as much as 10.6 percent in one month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Latest statistics released by the Bank of Zambia show the local currency which fell by 7.2 percent on Feb. 23 had shed a further 3.4 percent to K1,064.29 to One U.S. dollar.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The official exchange rate went down to K1,000.26 for one dollar on March 8, from K995.40 to the greenback on Feb. 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fall of the kwacha in relation to the dollar worsened in Dec. 1995 following what analysts said was due to the demand for hard currency created by the importation of maize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Demand for the dollar has been in excess of supply because of high demand for maize, vehicles, spare-parts and machinery, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the bank, excess demand for the dollar in December 1995 stood at 35,521,100.00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The local currency market could only supply 6,627,300.00 and 174,700 dollars for January and February respectively, it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Depreciation of the local currency is taking a toll on the country's debt obligation, reflected in further government borrowing leading to a rise in domestic debt to some K240.342 billion in February from K203.087 billion the previous month.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigeria's high quality Bonny Light crude again appreciated in price last weekend, over its United Kingdom counterpart, the Brent, at 21.25 dollars per barrel as against 20.30 dollars per barrel for the British brand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), quoting the London spot market, said the latest rise represents a modest increase of 90 cents over the 20.35 us dollars price for the preceding week which also outpaced the Brent by 1.25 dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Forcados, another high quality crude in the country, also gained in price closing at the same 21.25 dollars per barrel, or an increase of 2.02 dollars a barrel over its price for the preceding week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the latest upward movement, the third in three consecutive weeks, Nigeria could exceed its projected 19 billion naira (232 dollars) surplus for the current fiscal year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fears of an oil glut were expressed a fortnight ago by the re-opening of negotiations between Iraq and the United Nations over the Iraq's re-entry into the market, and the over supply of the product at the North Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Nigerian star crude, according to analysts, is expected to continue its upward trend, due mainly to the growing interest in the nation's oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> India and Taiwan, a fortnight ago, joined the increasing list of buyers when they purchased a total of six cargoes of both the Forcados and the Qua Iboe to be delivered to them next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria's 1996 budget predicated an oil earnings of 16 dollars per barrel and a target of total oil revenue of 214 billion naira. With the weekend's price level at 21.25 dollars, the nation would have raked an extra 5.25 dollars on each barrel sold per day vis-a-vis the budget estimates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This means the government, which sells an estimated 913,000 out of its share of 1.163 million barrels per day gains additional 4.65 million dollars every day crude is sold at 21.25 dollars per barrel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The price of Bonny Light has been on the upward movement since the release of the 1996 budget on Feb. 15. It recorded a drop from 19.65 dollars immediately after the budget to 17.90 dollars two weeks later - a price which remains the closest to the 16 dollars budget estimates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oil market analysts last week predicted the continued rise in price of crude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They attributed the favorable performance to both the growing interest in the brand among international buyers and the prolonged cold weather in most Western countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> YAOUNDE, Cameroon - The colour of kerosene sold in the Central African state of Cameroon will from Tuesday appear greenish in colour, a blend which is expected to stem the growing incidence of adulteration of the product which have led to many accidents sometimes resulting in deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement released in Yaounde on Monday, Minister of Mines Water Resources and Energy Bello Mbelle said the measure was being taken to check fraud in the marketing of petroleum products.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A substantial number of the country's 13 million people, especially city dwellers, use usually colorless kerosene, both for cooking and lighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But use of adulterated kerosene in stoves and lamps have often led to explosions and fire incidents sometimes with fatalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sometimes kerosene, which is cheaper, is mixed with other fuels and oils and sold off as either diesel or regular petrol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Various government initiatives to check the fraud have tended to fail because the fraudsters always sought efficient ways of deceiving customers, the minister said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But With the green color, consumers will henceforth easily detect the presence of kerosene in any fuel destined for use in engines, thanks to the green color which will tend to dominate when mixed with any other fuel,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement said all studies had been carried out in the laboratory to ensure that the coloring agent used is good for public consumption.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Almost 100,000 refugees and displaced persons have been trapped without food in Cap Mount county on Liberia's border with Sierra Leone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting led to closure of the highway to the area in mid-December 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WFP officials in Monrovia said they began the airlift Monday after getting reports that at least five people a day were dying of malnutrition in Cap Mount county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A WFP news release faxed to PANA quoted Liberia's WFP's country director Tarek el Guindi as saying &quot;these people have been trapped since December.  There's no food there at all and the conditions in the shelter camps are wretched.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WFP plans to airlift 60 metric tons of assorted foods for the 22,000 people thought most at risk in the sprawling refugee centers in western Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said the food will be airlifted using two helicopters donated by the United States to the West African Peace monitoring Force (Ecomog) in Liberia.  The operation is expected to take about four days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WFP's last food convoy to Cap Mount county was on Dec. 14, 1995, before fighting led to the closure of the route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WFP officials say they can feed only those most at risk of starvation until the highway is reopened to allow for greater amounts of food to be delivered.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - Officials and investors began talks Wednesday on the distribution of equity shares for the proposed regional carrier, ECOWAS airline, the organization's secretariat said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ECOWAS is the Economic Community of West African States whose headquarters is in the Nigerian capital, Abuja.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of its members are already shareholders in Air Afrique, the multinational airline of some French-speaking states in West and Central Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The high-level meeting is being attended by officials from the West African Chamber of Commerce and the African Business Roundtable. Both organizations represent business interests in the region. Representatives of foreign banks, aircraft manufacturers, insurance companies and tourist firms are also at the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The proposed airline would begin operation later in 1996 with an initial capital of 20 million U.S. dollars. The airline's network would cover most of Africa and would fly to North American and European countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ECOWAS officials said the groundwork for launching the airline had been completed, the remaining hurdle being the formal endorsement of the project by the council of ministers and heads of state of the 16-nation economic community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting of the council and the summit of West African leaders are scheduled for May and June respectively.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia - The Ethiopian government has firmly denied Sudanese accusations of helping rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) capture two coastal towns in southern Sudan early this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A statement issued Tuesday night by the Ethiopian foreign ministry described the allegation made by Khartoum earlier in the day as &quot;baseless.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Sudanese Army's General Command had accused Ethiopia of a series of attacks against Sudanese positions across the border using mechanised units, heavy guns and tanks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attacks, the Sudanese said, had forced their army units to withdraw from the towns of Yabus and Pochalla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They said the Ethiopian army had after the attacks, launched from within its own territory, occupied the two areas before handing them over to the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Ethiopian foreign office said the Sudanese allegations were merely &quot;a means of covering up its internal problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Ethiopia does not and will not interfere in domestic affairs of neighboring countries,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SPLA announced Monday it had overrun the town of Pachalla in Sudan's Upper Nile State and that its troops were on their way to another town, Pibor, in the same state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Relations between Ethiopia and Sudan were severely strained following last June's failed assassination of the Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak after he landed in Addis Ababa for an OAU summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sudan denies Egyptian and Ethiopian charges of involvement in the abortive attack and of also harboring three of the would-be assassins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ethiopia in September sought the help of the Organization of African Unity, and in December that of the United Nations Security Council to have the three extradited. They are believed to be Egyptian Muslim fundamentalists.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka, Zambia -- Zambian High Court Wednesday ordered the release of two newspaper editors imprisoned by the country's parliament for contempt of the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Editors Fred M'membe and Bright Mwape of The Post, a daily newspaper published in Lusaka, were last February sentenced to &quot;indefinite imprisonment&quot; for publishing material infringing parliamentary privileges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> High Court Judge Kabazo Chanda in his ruling however ordered M'membe to appear before parliament on one count of contempt of the house in an article published last January. He is alleged to have insulted a member of parliament.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Justice Chanda said he had found Mwape without a case to answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was hearing the editors' appeal in which they had sought for the state to show cause why they were being detained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> M'membe and Mwape have been in detention since March 4 following their sentencing by house Speaker Robinson Nabulyato who said he found them quilty of contempt and gross breach of parliamentary privilege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his ruling, Justice Chanda said that the &quot;indefinite&quot; remand of the editors by parliament was &quot;incompatible&quot; with Zambian law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the Zambian parliament was not a court in &quot;any sense at all&quot; but the supreme legislative organ in the land with powers to make, amend, repeal or re-make any laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is my legal duty to interfere with unorthodox disciplinary procedures like this one. I therefore order their (editors) release from prison forthwith,&quot; said Justice Chanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He described as an aberration of &quot;natural justice,&quot; the house's conviction and sentencing of the accused in their absentia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The person charged with contempt has to appear before the bar. Failure by him to appear at the required time and date is no reason for dispensing with this legal procedure and rule of natural justice,&quot; Chanda ruled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that his court has powers over major parliamentary actions, especially those that affected persons from outside the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He noted, however, that although the Zambian parliament was not a court as such, it retained powers to punish for contempt and imprison under common law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He cited the use of abusive language in a statement, speech or writing as some of the actions that could amount to contempt of parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Columnist Lucy Sichone, who was sentenced along with M'membe and Mwape on similar charges and is still at large, was also ordered by the High Court to surrender herself to parliament for contempt. She was said by the court to have used &quot;scornful language&quot; in her newspaper article last February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three were arraigned by parliament following a complaint by leader of the house Vice-President Bri.Gen. Godfrey Miyanda in January over articles they wrote which he said brought the house into ridicule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The articles by M'membe and Sichone commented on Miyanda's criticism of the Supreme Court ruling to quash the public order act which required that people obtain police permits for any public gatherings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Justice Chanda noted that M'membe's article said Deputy Minister &quot;Ernest Mwansa's underwear is an imitation&quot; and &quot;Ernest Mwansa must shut up&quot;.  He said this had established a prima facie case of contempt of parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sichone was alleged to have referred to the speaker of parliament as &quot; a grandmother in whose skirts the vice-president sought refugee,&quot; and further called the vice-president a hypocrite and a coward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have looked at Mwape's whole article and I find nothing insulting in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am a Zambian, and by my society, the use of odious and rude phrases against elders in society in contemptuous,&quot; Chanda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chanda said he could not have &quot;interfered&quot; in the detention had a a specified period been fixed for the editors to be held before appearing before a judiciary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva was Wednesday also expected to make a ruling on the case referred to it by the Zambian chapter of the Media Institute of Southern Africa (Misa).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The London-based human rights organization Amnesty International said recently that it was launching an international campaign to have the editors, whom it adopted as prisoners of conscience, freed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The current BSE scare in Europe prompted the agency's officials to hold a meeting in Lagos Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The organisation is working towards obtaining official approval for a fresh drive to enforce the ban on meat and meat product importation, especially from Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> European Union countries have already slammed a ban on the importation of British beef.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> British health officials and scientists rushed to Brussels, headquaters of the union, tuesday to ask its members to reconsider the ban but failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BSE, discovered 10 years, ago is believed to have been contracted by cattle from feed laced with the brains of sheep infected with a similar disease known as 'scrapie'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Initially, it was thought scrapie could not affect other animal species and was harmless to humans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it has now been proven that BSE also affected domestic cats, zoo animals and humans who fed on British beef.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEW YORK, United States - Nigerians around the world, communicating through the international Electronic Mail system or Internet, have launched a fund drive to help combat the meningitis epidemic currently wreaking havoc in some parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They have so far pledged about 3,000 dollars to the Nigerian Meningitis Assistance Fund, which was established some weeks ago through the Nigerian Information Network, 'Naijanet'.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'The Predominantly Nigerian subscribers to Naijanet were initially using the network as a forum for discussing the political situation in Nigeria but have now found a common cause in contributing to the meningitis fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The idea of the fund was mooted by Kasirim Nwuke, a Naijanet suscriber based in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since then, the names of those wishing to contribute to the fund and the amount to be contributed have been regularly sent to the forum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A bank account has been opened in Boston for the fund to which some 60 subscribers and non-subscribers have so far contributed amounts ranging from 10 to 100 dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the contributors, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he was particularly impressed by the &quot;atmosphere of trust and commitment&quot; surrounding the whole exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For people to send their money to those they have never met, just to support this cause, gives me a feeling that there is still hope for our country,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thousands of people have died following the outbreak of the spinal desease mainly in the northern parts of Nigeria early this year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal - A major anti-poliomyelitis immunization programme covering 50 million African children starts in June, Rotary International said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The organisation, a non-governmental body which funds such operations, said the effort will seek &quot;to eradicate polio from Africa.&quot; The programme will be repeated in 1997 and 1988.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, the programme will help to strengthen primary health delivery in the 25-target countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They will receive technical, financial and volunteer support from the World Health Organisation, Rotary International, the United Nations Chuldren's Fund, the Centre for Disease Control of the United States and that country's Agency for International Development, USAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The countries involved will organise national immunization days during which two doses of oral polio vaccine must be administered to all children under the age of five years, four to six weeks apart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The vaccination campaigns are expected to cost at least 33 million U.S. dollars. Rotary will contributed 8.5 million dollars, the Centre for Disease Control seven million dollars.  South Africa, one of the 25 countries African countries in the project, will fund its own programme with 2.84 million dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Director of Disease Control and Prevention at the World Health Organisation Africa Office, Dr. Deogratias Barakamfitiye, said that &quot;the wild polio virus continues to cripple children in at least half the 54 African countries. He cited the 1995 outbreak of polio in Zaire with at least 500 reported cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was briefing members of Rotary's sub-Saharan PoliPlus Committee meeting March 20 in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the challenge of mobilising resources in the 25 countries will be met by the continued determination of all the partners at country, regional and international level &quot;despite competing priorities resulting from other epidemics and civil unrest in a number of countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rotary's PolioPlus Committee said members in Africa should &quot;to make themeslves available and contribute to the successful implementation of the programme to help reach a polio-free world by the year 2000.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rotary will vaccinate 5.9 million people in Tanzania, 5.1 million in Kenya, 5.04 million in Mozambique and 4.46 million in Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another 3.35 million children in Cote D'Ivoire will be vaccinated, 3.34 million in Ghana, 2.7 million in Angola, 2.3 million in Burkina Faso, 2.2 million in Zimbabwe and 2.04 million in Malawi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - Sterility in men is a controversial issue worldwide as they erroneously tend to believe it is a one side affair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But now, a Nigerian medical doctor has added a new dimension to the controversy, linking the medical condition to tight pants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at a seminar organised by a Catholic church in Lagos Saturday, Dr. Okokon Ekandem claimed that such pants increased the temperature of sperm producing testes by pushing them close to the stomach, thereby reducing their capability to produce spermatozoa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spermatozoa is the medical term for the male reproductive fluid. Medical experts trace a man's inability to impregnate a woman to low sperm count among other medical conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his the paper entitled &quot;health related problems in marriage,&quot; Ekandem explained that testes develop at the back of the abdomen of the male child during pregnancy but grow outside its stomach after delivery, due to their sensitivity to heat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For semen to be very effective, there should be about 20 million spermatozoa per millimetre,&quot; the doctor said, adding that excessive heat reduces the number of sperms per millimetre of semen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said infertility had been one of the biggest problems affecting marriages, especially in developing countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Ekandem said with adequate care, the problem could be controlled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to him, &quot;infertility is like being bereaved of the child you never had.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the issue of blood geno-type tests before marriages, he said science and medicine had taken care of old beliefs that once someone had the &quot;SS&quot; chromosones, or blood type, death would be imminent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although he conceded that such tests were necessary for each party to be aware of what could happen to their offspring, Ekanem said love still had a great role to play in the sustenance pof happy marriages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Love is a critical factor in marriages and the decision over matters relating to genotype cannot be taken by a medical expert on behalf of couples,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe - Zimbabwe's health and child welfare secretary Rufaro Chatora on Monday expressed concern at the increase and excessive consumption of alcohol and other psycho-active substances in the southern African nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chatora told participants to a meeting on psycho-active substance use and community involvement in health that the excessive consumption of such substances had resulted in numerous health and socio-economic problems.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said although the problem used to be confined to men, it was rapidly spreading among women and children who had previously been spared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chatora said to make matters worse, the more dangeyous drugs such as mandrax, cocaine and heroin, which are not produced in Zimbabwe, were now freely available in the country and were being abused by a growing number of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said because of this increase, his ministry anticipated an escalation in the number of people seeking or requiring treatment for alcohol and drug related problems in the very near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The secretary said as a result there was need to explore alternative methods of treatment particularly simpler and cheaper methods that can be applied to the remote parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting was convened to discuss and work out strategies for dealing with substance abuse in primary health care settings and in the community.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MONROVIA, Liberia - Liberia's health ministry disclosed in Monrovia that four out of every 1000 persons in the capital are active carriers of tuberculosis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a press issued here Tuesday, the ministry said the 1995 statistics for TB cases in Monrovia alone showed 1,408 new cases in addition to the 1,376 recorded cases per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The 1996 records could be worse, considering the increase in the number of deaths related to TB in 1995 to 60, representing five deaths per month,&quot; the ministry said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ministry said between January and February 1996, 13 persons died of T.B in Monrovia, and that there are indications that tuberculosis-related deaths are progressively increasing, sometimes at the rate of three deaths per day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hospital sources said many of the TB patients were from rural Liberia where the number of cases could be higher than suspected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ministry attributed the unprecedented increase in TB to the six-year running conflict which it noted, has seriously disrupted farming activities, resulting in a decline in the nutritional status of most persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The release said the high incidence of TB is also a result of overcrowding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Citing the case of monrovia whose population has swelled from 400,000 prior to the war to over one million at present, the ministry said the entire Liberian population has been displaced with large numbers of persons presently residing in congested centers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said this high population density in areas considered safe from harrassment and intimidation by fighters of the numerous warring facstions, has led to the rapid spread of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TB has also been bouyed by the rapid spread of the Human Immuno Defiency Virus (HIV) and AIDS which weakens the human body's resistance to disease in general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The release noted that the rate at which TB is spreading demands that urgent measures be taken so that the disease does not get out of hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Health Organization says TB kills at least 600,000 Africans annualy out of the three million people it kills each year worldwide.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The minister of trade and tourism, Aguemon Sikirath, who announced the ban Wednesday, said on national television that Benin does not have the means of monitoring the country of origin and quality of beef imported into the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KAMPALA, Uganda, - President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda has said he intends to build a strong army in the East African country, if elected President in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am totally opposed to the idea of a weak army. My policy is to maintain a strong army because this world is still turbulent. The day of being in the bosom of our father Abraham has not come&quot; Museveni said in Kampala Wednesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was speaking at the launch of his election campaign manifesto, shortly after being nominated a candidate for presidential polls scheduled in May this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni said if he is elected president, he would foster regional cooperation including political federation where possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said he had prepared a document on East African cooperation which advocates a common market and army. He criticized interference of Western powers in Uganda's internal politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Some of our friends in the West are entitled to advise anyone without ideas. We have our own ideas. Intereference in our politics frustrates the enthusiasm of the masses and it is not good for democracy. Democracy will be secure if we understand it in our own way&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 47-page manifesto stresses building of factories, creation of service industries and modernization of agriculture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also calls for the provision of universal education, building of modern infrastructure and reinforcing defence and security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He promised that if elected, he will ensure that four children in each family as well as all orphans get free education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, tens of thousands of supporters of the two presidential candidates -- Museveni and Paul Ssemwogerere -- paralysed business in Kampala on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two were nominated candidates for the first direct presidential elections scheduled for May at the independence grounds, Kololo, in the Ugandan capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni is seeking to retain the presidency after 10 years in power but this time as an elected leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His supporters converged on Kololo very early in the morning in buses, taxis, lorries, pick-ups and saloon cars bearing his portraits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The situation became more hectic and confused in the afternoon as Ssemwogerere's supporters who came in a long convoy waving tree branches, moved across the city centre to Kololo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The crowd, at both nominations were estimated to be between 30,000 to 40,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Little known Mohammed Mayanja Kibirege, a university teacher and a late comer in the race, is expacted to join the two political giants after he is nominated on Thursday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal - The situation in the Central African state of Burundi remains tense but the United States is teaming up with European and African friends to pre-empt another bloodbath in the country, Brian Atwood, the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our feeling is that the situation in Burundi is very fragile but there is a possibility of a settlement at least for now,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Atwood spoke Thursday to the Pan African News Agency in Dakar, Senegal, while on the first leg of an African tour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the U.S., in partnership with the European Union and the Oganization of African Unity, should be able to bring all Burundi's parties to a conference, including extremists of the two major ethnic groups fanning the embers of hate in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> USAID and the European Commission announced March 22 a joint mission to Burundi and Rwanda for April to tackle the disastrous humanitarian situation in the two war-torn countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Atwood said the mission, which he and Emma Bonino of the Commission will undertake April 2-3 would assess the situation of repatriation and rehabilitation of refugees, reconstruction, reconciliation and empowerment of the civil society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, daily clashes between the Hutu majority and Tutsi minority, have continued in Burundi since October 1993 when the country's first elected president, Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, was killed in a failed coup mounted by the army dominated by the Tutsi ethnic group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Up to 100,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu were killed in the mayhem that ensued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Atwood fears ongoing &quot;creeping genocide&quot; could escallate to mass killings similar to events in neighboring Rwanda where some one million people, mainly Tutsi, were massacred by Hutu extremists in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the joint mission will try to quicken preparations for the trial of the genocide suspects by an internatonal tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mission will also work out modalities for a lasting political settlement while the economy, presently dominated by one group, will have to open up to the population and the outside world to bring in an element of stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The return of thousands of refugees will also be encouraged. So far, some 40,000 of an estimated two million refugess in neighboring countries have returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Atwood said the mission will learn from the scathing criticism levelled againt the international community in the way it handled the situation in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was referring to the division between the United States and European countries, especially France and Belgium, on how to resolve the conflict in the two former Belgian colonies which have the same ethnic configuration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While France and Belgium seemed to be supporting the majority Hutu, Washington was acccused of using &quot;African fronts&quot; to support the powerful minority Tutsi group which took over power in Rwanda in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Atwood said: &quot;A rough stablilization may be occuring in the army as the Tutsi are beginning to realize that they cannot cope with the increasing inflitration of Hutu extremists from neighboring countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Hutu account for some 85 percent of the six million Burundians. The Tutsi make up about 15 percent while the third group, the Twa, account for 1 percent. In Rwanda, Hutus make up 90 percent as against 9 percent and 1 percent for the Tutsi and the Twa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The French, he said, have a history which have caused friction in their relations with the countries &quot;but our position is to work effectively with the French in order to avoid the type of crisis we had in Rwanda,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The seeming rapprochement between the United States and Europe on this and other problems in Africa, is part of the New Trans-Atlantic Plan aimed at strengthening cooperation between the two sides who are the two major donors in Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal - The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has stopped its aid to Cameroon and Togo, after a disagreement on how assistance should be chanelled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> USAID Aministrator Brian Atwood said in an interview in Dakar the govenments in Younde and Lome insist on managing such aid while the agency prefers direct links with grassroots communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The closer you get to the people the more likely it is for development aid to achieve a positive impact,&quot; Atwood said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the agency, whose aid funds are increasingly being reduced by the Republican party-dominated Congress, is trying to strengthen links with credible non-governmental organizations to channel assistance to the needy in recepient countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> USAID, launched in 1961 under the administration of President John F.  Kennedy, began implementing a new cost-cutting initiative with Atwood's assumption of office in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This focuses on the minimal presence of American personnel and effective intervention in most crucial areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1993 the agency was present in 120 countries. By the year 2000 its programs will be targeted on some 75 countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Atwood said most of the 700 million dallars USAID will be spending in Africa this fiscal year will go to countries which practise democracy and observe human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Foreign assistance is a vital foreign policy tool for preventing crises and avoiding the high cost of peacekeeping and emergency relief operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Also, by fostering an enabling environment for free markets and increasing the economic capacity of developing nations, foreign aid creates markets abroad for U.S. goods and helps ensure the economic well-being of the United States in the next century,&quot; a USAID brief said in reference to the increasing tendency by Capitol Hill to slash aid money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Atwood said many African countries -- including Botswana, Ghana and Zimbabwe -- had become attractive for foreign investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A dozen others were set to &quot;take off&quot; by the next decade, and for the Unites States to win part of this market, it must also be engaged in their development, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked what his country was doing for Liberia which has been wrecked by a six-year old civil war, Atwood said his agency was providing significant humanitarian assistance to Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Atwood said that he would discuss Liberia and Niger where the military took over power from elected civilians recently, with Senegal's President Abdou Diouf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The USAID administrator, who is also President of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), arrived in Dakar on March 26 to begin an African tour that will take him to Burundi, Rwanda and other Great Lakes countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - Zambian police in the northern copperbelt town of Kitwe Wednesday barred former President Kenneth Kaunda from addressing a public meeting of his opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP) because he did not have a police permit for the gathering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dunstan Simukoko, in charge of Kitwe district police command said his men had advised Kaunda not to go ahead with the rally which, he said, would breach a new public order act.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Kaunda was issued with a permit to address an in-door meeting but that he later changed his mind and wanted to hold an outdoor rally in one of the townships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The police action was in accordance with the &quot;reinstated&quot; public order act requiring police permits for public meetings and demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organizers of public gatherings and processions now need to give police 14 days notice, unlike in the past when police had the discretion to issue the permits on the spot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Justice Matthew Ngulube had earlier this year quashed the order, which he said, was at variance with the country's new multiparty political order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) government of President Frederick Chiluba, however, reintroduced the law and prescribed the 14-day notice requirement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda was in 1995 prosecuted on two counts of addressing political meetings without police permit. This prompted UNIP lawyers to challenge the act in court, leading to its annulment by the chief justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposition has criticized the law which they say could be manipulated by senior officials of the ruling party including the president and cabinet ministers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The theme of the meeting, which opened Tuesday in Ougadougou, Burkina Faso, is &quot;The Military and Democracy in Africa.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been organized by Germany's Konrad Adenauer Foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the major topics being discussed is the reemergence of military coups in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The officers at the meeting are from five Francophone countries -- Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and Togo. The five have at one time or another other fallen under military rule since independence in the 1960s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of them, Niger suffered a coup d'etat in January 1996 when the army seized power from a bickering president and his prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Benin, a former military ruler, Gen. Mathieu Kerekou, has been re-relected president after being beaten in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The participants are examining proposals for the creation of a regional force along the model of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting coincides with the official end of northern Mali's Tuareg rebellion with the destruction Wednesday of 3,000 pieces of war material used during a campaign by the nomads for an autonomous state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TRIPOLI, Libya - An Egyptian plane landed Thursday morning at Libya's Benghazi airport, 651 miles east of Tripoli, to take back 159 passengers and crew of an Egypt Air plane hijacked from the Egyptian town of Luxor Wednesday and forced to fly to Tobruk in eastern Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The plane came with an unspecified number of Egyptian journalists on board, the Libyan News Agecy (JANA) reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The hijacking ended peacefully Wednesday evening when the hijacker surrendered to Libyan security forces. None of the passengers were hurt.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A PANA correspondent who witnessed negotiations at the control tower, reported that the hijacker initially sought direct access to Libyan leader Col. Moammar Kadhafi, before accepting an indirect conversation through the airport's liaison officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kadhafi demanded that the hijacker guarantee the safety of all passengers before meeting his requirements. The latter assured Kadhafi that no one would be hurt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am not a terrorist. I would only like to inform President Hosni Mubarak that I have information on the failed assassination attempt against him at the last OAU summit in Addis Abeba&quot;, the hijacker said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The hijacker also demanded the lifting of the Israeli blockade in Palestinian territories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Libyan television, the Egypt Air Airbus had on board 59 Canadians, 16 French, 16 Egyptians and 18 other nationals including Japanese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Libyan television and news agency JANA confirmed late Wednesday that a lone man was involved in the hijack of the Egyptian plane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Cairo television spoke of three pirates, all of them Egyptians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The plane was flying from Djeddah to Cairo when it was hijacked and forced to land at Tobruk after a scheduled stop-over in Luxor, Egypt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Libya is currently under a United Nations air embargo for having failed to hand over two suspects believed to have been involved in the bombing of a Pan Am plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - International Vincent Mutale is about to sneak out to Columbia but Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) blocked him until some contentious issues in his contract are clarified. And FAZ has summoned Mutale's club Mufulira Wanderers and Dennis Lota's Konkola Blades officials to a meeting in Kitwe this Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General secretary Colonel Hermann Mpashi said in Lusaka Wednesday FAZ had invited the two clubs to discuss their players who are emroiled in transfer wrangles.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''We have asked Mutale's club and Konkola to a meeting after the Charity Shield on Sunday on matters pertaining to their players,'' Mpashi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lota who is currently attending trials in Europe has apparently signed a contract with Witbank Aces of South Africa who have demanded the right to negotiate for him should he be successful in Europe. But after the Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa two months ago, Lota, the most sought after Zambian player, linked to five European clubs, has been told by FIFA, the world soccer governing body he will have to play for Aces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mutale should have left for Columbia on March 12 but was blocked because his club contract did not adequately provide for early release for him to feature for Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The contentious clause has something to do with the player's release for national duty and the Columbian club has not made its position clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mpashi, while quoting article 35 of the FIFA statutes on players transfers, said the club will have to respect the clause. FIFA insists that a club must allow for training time before international matches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The FIFA rules state that the club is obliged to release a player 48 hours before a friendly match, five days before an international qualifying encounter and at least 14 days before the finals of an international tournament such as the Olympics, Africa Cup and the World Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mpashi said until the proper proceedures are followed, Mutale will not be released. He said Mutale's local agent erred when he signed a contract binding the player to 48 hours no release before any match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the matter is resolved, Mpashi said Mutale will be released and allowed to travel to South America. But sources said the Columbian club did not want to deal with a local agent and had demanded that they be allowed to talk to FAZ and Wanderers direct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wanderers officials held a meeting Wednesday but were persuaded to hold their cool since the player had to feature for Wanderers in the Africa Club Champions Cup second round second leg last Sunday against Mbabane Highlanders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mutale has risen to stardom since joining Wanderers four seasons ago. He broke into the under-23 squad and was an automatic choice for the midfield senior national team place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the last Africa Cup, Mutale was a regular for Zambia and scored one of Zambia's 12 goals in six matches.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organisers of the Miss Universe Championship in Zambia, Lute Perfumeries Limited, say the change of venue from Carlton centre in Johannesburg to Las Vegas in Nevada has thrown a big set-back in the way of Tamara attending the world event as this has pushed up costs to very high levels.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the Organisers, Ms Eve Kazembe, said because of the high cost of sending Tamara to the States it has been found necessary to send out appeals to airlines, hotels, travel agents and others in the tourism sector so that they may help the entrant travel to Nevada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tamara - The Miss Zambia for the competition - won the title in December 1995.  She is 21 and is due to go to a Marketing College later in the year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Lusaka High Court Wednesday freed two Post Editors and ruled that Parliament erred by sentencing them and a columnist in absentia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> High Court judge, Justice Kabazo Chanda, said he had also found Post Managing Editor Bright Mwape innocent on both counts but editor-in-chief Fred M'membe and Lucy Sichone needed to defend themselves for contempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Justice Chanda was delivering judgement in an application for the issue of habeas corpus asking the court to order the two editors released from prison.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Indefinite jail terms are incompatible with our legal system and unorthodox disciplinary proceedures cannot be allowed,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He had found Mwape innocent on both counts though M'membe needed to defend himself for contempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Justice Chanda said Mwape was a free man but M'membe needed to appear before Parliament and be formally charged when its sittings resume.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He had established a prima facie case of the charge of contempt for columnist Lucy Sichone who has gone into hiding and advised her to report to Parliament with M'membe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Parliament was not a court in any judicial sense but it had power to commit people to prison because that was the only way it would guard against being defamed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> M'membe, Mwape and Sichone were summoned to appear before the House on February 23 but did not show up until March 4 when a warrant for their arrest had already been issued and an indefinite jail term slapped on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Justice Chanda said Parliament should have found out why the duo had not reported for a whole week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He censured M'membe and Sichone for alleged vulgar language on members of the House and urged them to desist from using terminology that was incompatible with Zambian tradition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After judgement, Mr Justice Chanda told Post Lawyers and State Advocates that they were free to appeal. Later, Mr M'membe bemoaned the poor prison conditions as he came out of Lusaka Remand Prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''This prison was built in 1905 and it has not been extended since,'' he lamented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''Conditions are bad and there are more than 1,000 prisoners including children between 10 and 12 years,'' he added.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Former President and opposition UNIP leader, Dr Kenneth Kaunda, is to set up a 'Truth Commission' to be served by human rights experts from other countries - once returned into office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main task of this commission will be to enquire into how Zambian parastatal companies were sold or privatised and how proceeds of their sales were used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Dr Kaunda's statement has prompted Information and Broadcasting Services Minister and Chief Government Spokesman, Amusaa Mwanamwambwa, Tuesday to dismiss the idea as 'misguided and totally unjustified.'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Minister noted that in the Zambian context such a commission would be a sheer waste of time and resources which would rather be spent on development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At his meetings, both in Ndola on Monday and Lusaka rural at the week-end, the former head of state maintained that his 'truth commission' will try to establish who had bought the parastatals and where money from sales of these companies had gone since he suspects that leaders had sold off the majority of the companies to themselves 'at give away prices and resulting in many rendundancies.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reacting to the demands for a 'truth commission', Mr Mwanamwambwa pointed out that such a commission can only be set up in a country where there have been serious crimes against humanity such as genocide, or countries emerging out of a war situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''Zambia is far from such a state of affairs, and it is hoped that this is not the basis for the opposition parties' war talk to justify a truth commission,'' Mr Mwanamwambwa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He cited South Africa, as one country in Southern Africa which had justifiably established a truth commission and a government of national unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''The history of that country is well known. To compare the conditions in South Africa to those in Zambia is, therefore, fallacious; based on an incorrect premise and an unjustified position,'' Mr Mwanamwambwa noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He wondered why it should be necessary to involve members of the international community in an issue which is purely domestic and which can be resolved by the Zambian people themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If individuals have committed crimes, Zambia has adequate legal institutional framework to deal with such matters,'' Mr Mwanamwambwa observed adding that the 'truth commission' may still have to refer its work to the Zambian legal system now in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Kaunda told his meetings in Lusaka rural that his previous administration had built schools, colleges and two universities which gave thousands of Zambians skills and academic knowledge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To underscore his declaration that he was still both mentally and physically alert to function as State President Dr Kaunda, who will be 72 later this year, jumped up and down the meeting platform shouting that he was still strong enough to rule Zambia again.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Kenneth &quot;Bubble&quot; Malitoli's Columbian professional deal has been botched by his former Tunisian side who have placed a US$50,000 tag for every move the Zambian makes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The situation has forced the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) to seek FIFA, the world football governing body to intervene in what has been described as a crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Esperance released Malitoli last year on a free transfer but changed their mind after seeing the midfielder in action for Zambia during the Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It seems there is a big problem with Esperance because they still insist on getting a certain percentage of Malitoli's transfer fee,&quot;said FAZ member Musa Kasonka .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have since written to FIFA to see how we can be helped on this issue. We want to see that our player is not held hostage by anyone because it's not fair,&quot;said Kasonka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malitoli has been offered a playing contract in Columbia which insiders described as lucrative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Tunisians have refused to do the paperwork insisting that they be paid US$50,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Malitoli has been allowed to feature for his childhood side Nkana on a temporary clearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Kenneth was offered a well-paying contract in Colombia but because Esperance want to get a US$50,000 from the deal, the Colombians refused to pay Esperance,&quot; said a source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And FAZ will this Sunday hold an emergency meeting in Kitwe to make its stand on the globe-trotting Zambian International Denis Lota.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Two Post editors imprisoned indefinitely by parliament for contempt yesterday walked to freedom when High Court judge Kabazo Chanda released them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judge Chanda ordered the release of managing director and editor-in-chief Fred M'membe, and managing editor Bright Mwape, and ruled that the manner and procedure in which Parliament sentenced the duo without them presenting their case was unorthodox and incompatible with the rule of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judge Chanda however, found that some of the words used by M'membe and columnist Lucy Sichone in their articles on the Speaker and deputy minister Ernest Mwansa were very strong and constituted contempt of parliament while Mwape's was said to be non contemptuous.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said both M'membe and Sichone should present themselves before the national Assembly when it resumes and clarified his ruling by saying that Sichone was free until she presents herself to the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judge Chanda also ruled that both articles did not breach the parliamentary priviledges as everyone was free to make comments on public institutions and figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The judge told a packed courtroom in the absence of M'membe, who could not attend the proceedings that Parliament was not a court while the High and Supreme courts had power to inquire into actions of parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I wish to say that parliament is not a court in any judicial sense. And because it is not a court, it can not be above or at par with the High Court.  It is indeed the supreme legislative body in the country,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judge Chanda further ruled that Zambian courts were at liberty to intervene in matters of law where it involves the National Assembly such as to settle disputes that may have been caused to individuals by the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And reacting to the release of the editors, Senanga MP Inonge Mbikusita Lewanika said that she was happy with the court's decision because it had made the position clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am happy with the decision especially that the position of parliament not being a court has been clarified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said she had been saddened by the decision by parliament to imprison the two and hoped that such barbaric behaviour by an organ of government would not be repeated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She however cautioned adults and political leaders to refrain from acts that would force young ones to ridicule them by leading a dignified life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIP's Rupiah Banda said he was overwhelmed by the court's judgement which would go along way in ensuring that parliament does not infringe on people's rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National Mirror editor in chief and Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA) Zambia chapter chairman Fanwell Chembo lauded the judgement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is a pity that such a decision was made by parliament on the duo.  But the High Court ruling is encouraging. This is what should be happening in this country. Justice must be seen to be done to all,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Presidential aide for press and public relations who came shortly after the judgement was passed shook hands but had nothing to say about the judgement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked for a coment on the release of the Post editors, presidential press aide Richard Sakala who was shaking hands with Mwape hesistantly replied: &quot;I don't think I am the right person to do so.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Just over a year ago Colleen de Reuck gave birth to her first child, and ever since the soon-to-be-32 year-old Durbanite's running form has been on an upward spiral. Last Saturday she registered possibly the greatest achievement of her career when she placed fifth in the world cross country championships in Stellenbosch, missing the bronze medal by the narrowest of margins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The world cross country championships are widely regarded as the toughest distance race on the calendar with many of the world's top distance runners in events from 1 500m up to the marathon taking part. As she left the Danie Craven Stadium for the final round of the three-lap race she put in a surge going down the ramp and took the lead accompanied by an expectant roar from the home crowd. But it was short-lived and Ethiopia's Gete Wami and the Kenyans Rose Cheruiyot and Naomi Mugo overtook her.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She stuck resolutely to them though and only Wami put any real distance between her as she broke over the final 200m for a convincing victory. As De Reuck made a brave attempt to take Mugo on the line, Olympic 10 000m champion Derartu Tulu of Ethiopia sprinted past her. All three of them finished with the same time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Behind De Reuck were some of the world's greatest runners like world 10 000m champion, Fernanda Ribeiro of Portugal, Sally Barsosio of Kenya and Ireland's Catherina McKiernan. &quot;I don't put myself up there with the world's best and I think that's half my problem. I'm slowly beginning to believe that I'm also good and I guess I just need to work on it a bit more,&quot; says De Reuck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since returning to South Africa just before the cross country trials which she won in February she has she has also run an Olympic qualifying time of 15:24,77 in the 5 000m. &quot;Since I came back I've set two personal bests on the track and yet they were my first track races in three years and I haven't done any track work what so ever. All I know is that I'm in very good shape right now and it must be Bobby (McGee's) training programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'm not doing high mileage or fast track work. He says I must rest because I've just done a marathon,&quot; says De Reuck. The marathon is a sore point for her right now because although she is truly world class over the distance she won't be going to Atlanta for the marathon. Last year she planned to record an Olympic qualifying time of below 2:35 at the New York Marathon in November but then the cold weather and problems in getting her drinks at the water tables reduced her to a walk before she finally finished 14th outside the required time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blood tests revealed the race had taken little out of her and so she decided to try again four weeks later at the Honolulu Marathon. A notoriously humid race, last year's proved to be the worst on record and although she won she again missed out on an &quot;A&quot; standard Olympic qualifier. She opted out of the South African marathon trials a month ago. &quot;If I'd done New York, Honolulu and then SAs I wouldn't have been in my best shape in Atlanta. I really had bad luck with my races and I was hoping they would take that in to consideration but obviously they can't take me on a &quot;B&quot; standard if Elana (Meyer) already has an &quot;A&quot; standard,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The irony is that with the humidity and extremely tough course in Atlanta (people are predicting the men's winning time at over 2:20) there are many who believe that De Reuck would be a better bet than Meyer. Instead she will now have to hope the wind doesn't blow at the national track and field championships in Cape Town next month and aim for a 10 000m qualifying time.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The Kenyans dominated the world cross country championships once again, but the organisers were the real winners</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SOUTH AFRICA'S aspirations to host the world's top sporting events received a significant boost after last Saturday's world cross country championships in Stellenbosch which many experienced observers considered the best they had ever attended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The local organising committee (LOC), which put together the event on behalf of Athletics South Africa (ASA), encountered unprecedented difficulties in its task of signing up sponsors and making the championships financially viable, but that did not prevent it from putting on an extremely slick and professional show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the credit for this belongs to a small number of dedicated people on the executive committee who rolled up their sleeves and decided the championships would be a success, irrespective of the financial problems.  These problems were brought about by the International Amateur Athletic Federation's own difficulties in signing new sponsors for its four-year package known as the World Athletic Series, the most recent of which came to an end last year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The world cross country championships form part of this series and the LOC was only given the go-ahead to source sponsors locally less than a month before they were due to take place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Cape Town city council, which at the beginning rather hesitantly provided a R1- million guarantee, eventually converted part of this guarantee into a substantial sponsorship and it was joined by 11 other companies and organisations as official product/service companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Old Mutual also became the first South African company to obtain title sponsor rights to an IAAF event and because of the world governing body's current problems it can be safely assumed it got them at a very favourable price. While most of the advertising that was produced early for the event contained only two IAAF official sponsors, the LOC was told four days before the championships to include Carlsberg as a third.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So desperate is the IAAF to sort out its sponsorship crisis that it can be reliably reported that Carlsberg had still not signed its deal with the IAAF and was holding out with an offer that was $500 000 less than the IAAF expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Television coverage of the championships was also provided free of charge internationally by the IAAF, using its own in-house production team, after it failed to complete television contracts for the new period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The European Broadcasting Union, which handles the negotiations for all European national networks, offered just half the R346-million it paid for the last four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps the biggest winner out of the sponsorship wheeling and dealing was the Cape Town 2004 Olympic Bid Company. &quot;There was a tremendous benefit to the bid from these championships although they at times seemed reluctant to come on board,&quot; said LOC financial manager Gareth Griffiths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But while the superb organisation of the championships certainly did the bid no harm, an equally important spin-off for the bid was the IAAF council meeting held last Sunday and Monday which brought five International Olympic Committee members to Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The council meeting was never part of the LOC's budget for the championships. and considering its other financial problems, it is not surprising there was resentment from the LOC when it was told it would have to foot the bill for it as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cost of holding the meeting was thrust upon the LOC in January after ASA president Leonard Chuene offered to host it at a meeting in Gothenburg last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fortunately, when the Bid Company signed an official service company contract it agreed to contribute to some of the costs of the council meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On race day the people of the Western Cape came out in their thousands to support the championships which rarely attract big crowds. The estimated throng of around 15 000 gave vociferous support to all the runners and especially the South Africans. The atmosphere was as memorable as the glorious setting of the University of Stellenbosch playing fields in the shadow of the Helderberg and Simonsig mountains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The real success of the championships, however, belongs to people like Griffiths, Joel Ramatlhape and Roy Cheesman, the project managers appointed from the executive committee to oversee the organisation of the event. They more than anyone put in the long hours and came up with solutions to the many teething problems, ensuring there were no hitches come zero hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former mayor of Cape Town, Sol Kreiner, did most of the lobbying for sponsors while the well-designed and testing course was the work of environmental consultant, Stephen Grainger, who combined his technical knowledge with a genuine love and understanding of the sport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So happy were the IAAF with the arrangements for the championships that its event director, Eric Savard, said the LOC was the best he'd ever worked with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following on the successful Rugby World Cup and African Cup of Nations, the world cross country championships will have sent another clear message to the world that South Africa is ready and able to stage the two biggest prizes of all, the 2004 Olympic Games and the 2006 soccer World Cup.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - There is, provided you are not a tennis player, something remarkably special about Rome. The city lives. This vibrancy in the very air you breathe in the Italian capital is in sharp contrast to the stadium where the nation plays its tennis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Foro Italico is as dead as any of the species we are told incessantly that just being alive on this planet is helping to wipe out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, in truly perverse Italian style, the local tennis fans celebrate the long-ago passing of the venue's clay surface as they do everything, endowing the proceedings with the very flavour of zestful life itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Playing at the Foro Italico -- or, indeed, even viewing the proceedings -- is a long way from the structured Englishness of Beckenham and Wimbledon, where unaccustomed sunburn and oddly coloured club ties rule. It is not even distantly related to the Gallic indifference of Roland Garros, where the crowds suddenly thin if the match is not to their liking, regardless of what has been shelled out in francs for a centre court seat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Italian tennis fan has more of an affinity with the men on the soccer terraces than those who crowd the baselines in the rest of the world.  Perhaps this is the last vestige of the frenzy which greeted the unfortunates who starred in the Circus Maximus. But then again, perhaps it has more to do with in-bred Latin effervescence than a latent longing for the days when the scoreline read: &quot;Lions 10, Christians 0.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is into this atmosphere the South African Davis Cup team venture over the coming Easter weekend in their quest to go beyond the Italians and the world group second round of one of the sporting world's premier team competitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wayne Ferreira, Gary Muller, Marcos Ondruska, John-Laffnie de Jager and new boy Ellis Ferreira -- at present tuning up in the laid-back heat of Miami -- have something coming in the way of a culture shock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Especially with the memory of the low-key support of South African crowds in the tie against Austria, at first on grass courts of the Wanderers and then moving to the muted mumble from the bleachers in the Standard Bank Arena after the hasty switch of venues necessitated by the in-clemency of the weather.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It will be a massive change. Even for the veterans of Rome like Wayne Ferreira and Gary Muller. For this time there will be the fervour of nationalism added to the vocal and partisan Italian crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is an almost physical surge off the stands that Italy's non-playing captain Adriano Panatta will remember and no doubt encourage his team to use to their advantage in exactly the way Panatta himself did in his heyday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Italian team -- Renzo Furlan, Andrea Gaudenzi, Stefano Pesconsolido and Diego Nargiso -- are hardly household names in world tennis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But then the Italians were good enough to beat Russia in the opening world group round, something the South Africans could not manage in Moscow during the last Davis Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given the lifeless clay surface and the super- heated partisanship of the Italian crowd, this is not an easy tie, no matter how you carve up the singles and doubles or weight the ATP points of the individual players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rome is always a very different proposition. And among Davis Cup players, only the ill- considered go out of their way to throw the traditional coins in the Trevi fountain. For most, a return to the Eternal City is the last thing on their minds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Advertising agencies are being swept up by the &quot;fourth media&quot; -- the Internet -- but they disagree on whether it is more viable to handle it in-house or commission work to an outside agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While VWV Interactive, an independent agency responsible for audio-visual presentations, believe advertising agencies must use outside expertise, other agencies disagree with this, saying it is more cost-effective to keep the operation of advertising on the Internet in- house, thus holding on to the expertise and ensuring that the knowledge is retained by the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jason Xenopoulos, who heads VWV's Internet section, says he believes in using outside agencies. &quot;The fact is that utilising new media types to communicate and advertise is a very different process to above the line advertising, and outside expertise on the use of the Internet for advertising is therefore necessary.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Xenopoulos says the designing of the web site, the culture behind the Internet and the technology involved require a different mindset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The biggest danger facing ad agencies is that they may offer clients a second-rate service. They should be hiring or using people that are entrenched in the interactive market rather than filtering art and creative copy writers to do a task that is technically-based and highly skilled,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hunt Lascaris TBWA disagrees with VWV Interactive. It believes inhouse advertising on the Internet is more viable. The new status of cyberspace as a creative medium was taken up by the agency when it launched its in-house operation, called &quot;thesite&quot;, two weeks ago. It is one of the first of local advertising agencies which is following international trends of housing interactive departments within a single agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hunt Lascaris has opted to go in-house when most local agencies are hesitant. Although thesite is in-house in terms of falling under the banner of the entire Hunt Lascaris group, it operates as a specialised independent agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thesite's managing director James Hier says Internet advertising is a &quot;limitless media&quot; when compared to the constraints of print, radio and television advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In print one is defined to text and editorial space, in radio there are no visuals and colour to capture your audience's attention and on television you get limited time of about 15 to 30 seconds which do not allow consumers to fully absorb the different aspects of a single product.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where in print one may see an advertisement for a car, on the Internet one can click on a computer key and access the interior of a car, the modifications of the car and even a full showcase of the models of that car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Hier, the Internet is cheaper than other mediums, is not intrusive and allows the consumer to derive as little or as much information as required. &quot;This means that the multi-media environment allows marketeers to produce advertising messages in various forms. You can receive as rich a form of advertising as you wish from a text to an actual visual demonstration of a product.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In-house advertising is, therefore, more feasible, because as advertisers you have the expertise of dealing with clients. A computer boff may know the technical side of the Internet, but may be out of touch with market trends,&quot; Hier said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hunt Lascaris deputy managing director Johnny Johnson says there are always projections on the impact of new technology over old. &quot;When radio came along, people forecast the death of the newspaper, then when television appeared some said radio's days were numbered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It was also argued that telephones would signal the death knell of the postal system, but all are going strong because they adapt to market forces and find new ways of consolidating their positions and the way people use them,&quot; Johnson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He adds that advertising on the Internet will become sophisticated and advertising agencies merely had to take advantage of the Internet as another tool which can be used together with other media forms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lindsay Smithers-FCB media director Tony Banahan says it is more cost-effective to have the expertise inhouse, but to source the hardware of a special Internet service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have the experts who design and create inhouse because they are in touch with the clients and have a grasp of the technology, but we use a site which is based elsewhere as its more cost-effective than establishing an entire operation,&quot; Banahan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ivor Jones, Roy media analyst Peter Armitage says advertising on the Internet is in the &quot;embryonic stages&quot; although there is tremendous long-term potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is a lot of experimenting by agencies attempting to reach their advertising objectives and the jury is out on whether or not in-house or commissioning an outside agency is more viable.&quot; He says either way, Internet advertising is niche marketing at its best because it targets specific people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) says it is discussing a form of regulation on the Internet and is working closely with an international umbrella body called the European Advertising Standards Alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was approached by an association called the Networking Association, which is in the process of canvassing the local electronic media industry in a bid to muster support for self-regulation on the Internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The objective of the association is to monitor the Internet for illegalities and provide the public with an organisation where they can lodge complaints pertaining to services on the Internet. As the advertising only exists in electronic form, there may be a need for records to be kept of all material emitted so any subsequent complaints could be investigated, the ASA said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It added that many of the issues needed international consensus based on who will ultimately be held responsible for transgressions and what form regulation will take.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The European Union was sharply criticised this week for trying to treat South Africa as a developed nation rather than one with special development needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African National Congress MP Rob Davies, fresh back from a trip to Europe to attend a meeting of the EU and African-Caribbean-Pacific (ACP) joint assembly, said during the debate on the Budget in parliament that South Africa would be &quot;naive to ignore all the clear signals that demands for reciprocity have replaced expressions of solidarity as the central feature of North-South trade agreements&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the long-delayed decision by the general affairs council of the EU to approve a detailed negotiating mandate for a free trade agreement (FTA) between the EU and South Africa marked the end of one battle, but also the start of a much more difficult one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mandate of the EU sought a fully reciprocal trade agreement, on which South Africa would have to make concessions as well as receive benefits and it might have to give more than it took.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was a far cry from the days when, at the height of Europe's &quot;solidarity&quot; with the newly democratic South Africa, South Africa was hoping to be included in the Lome Convention, which provides special concessions such as duty-free access to the developing countries in the ACP. This was ruled out by the EU last year; it said a free trade agreement was the route to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Davies said the EU initially proposed that there should be a fully reciprocal FTA covering 90% of each party's trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Calculations made on the basis of figures in the draft mandate indicated that this would have required the EU to remove duties on only 7% of its imports from us (mainly agricultural products), but would have required us to remove duties on 46% of our imports from the EU,&quot; Davies said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But intense pressure from groups within the EU had resulted in a &quot;sizeable list&quot; of mainly agricultural products making up nearly 39% of our current exports to the EU that would be excluded from the FTA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;So it now appears that we are no longer talking about opening up 46% of our market to gain 7% additional duty-free access to the EU, but something considerably less than 7%,&quot; Davies said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, parliament should be sending a very clear signal to the negotiators that it would not feel comfortable ratifying something that did not take the specific needs and realities of South Africa into account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is sometimes difficult to remember, when we see what is currently on offer, that all this arose because the EU said it wanted to help us,&quot; Davies said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa accounted for only 1,9% of EU imports, while the EU supplied nearly 40% of South Africa's imports. At the same time, South Africa's gross domestic product was half that of Belgium, which was one of the smaller EU members with a quarter of South Africa's population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Yet the EU, one of the most powerful trading blocs in the world, appears to be treating us in this negotiation as though we were just another competitor without the special development needs it claims to support,&quot; Davies said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Indeed, up to now, it has been much more sensitive to the claims of special interest groups in Europe than it has to its professed commitment to promoting development in Southern Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Davies said that although South Africa was aware of Europe's sensitivities and concerns about the effect of an FTA on its own production and jobs, these applied even more so to South Africa with its 40%-plus unemployment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We accept that creating competitive industries is integral to this process, but this necessitates restructuring, which will require time and resources. We are certainly not there yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tariff reductions already implemented under the Uruguay Round of trade agreements were affecting some South African industries badly and further reductions of the kind being envisaged could lead to further job losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Davies said that the EU-ACP joint assembly had passed a resolution criticising the delays in trade negotiations with South Africa and the EU's increasingly protectionist stand. It also urged that the non-trade Lome-type benefits promised South Africa should be &quot;fast-tracked&quot; because of the delays in trade negotiations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Papa Wemba is quiet but emphatic. &quot;Please, I don't want to talk about le sape. The French press have made a great noise about my clothes, but my first identity is as a musician.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zaireans, of course, are great nightclubbers, and (like their fellows the world over) set considerable store by style. And the Papa Wemba myth has it that he founded the &quot;Societe des Ambianceurs et des Personnes legantes&quot; (Sape), which created a cult of flaunting designer labels -- sometimes to the point of turning jackets inside-out to display their provenance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The man himself is elegant enough as he sits, surrounded by sociable homeboys, in Ruffin N'Gbanzo's Zairois restaurant in Yeoville. The suit is cream silk, the striped polo shirt has a designer logo lurking on the left breast. But the eyes in a mature, serious face don't light up until we start talking about music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Music was what I was born to, through my mother. She was a professional mourner in a small village in Kasai Province and my first example, my first teacher. I followed her everywhere, and also began to sing with her at the funerals. She encouraged me to think of music as a career 26 years ago when I was approaching my 20s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By then Papa Wemba was living in Kinshasa, and with a gang of musically inclined township buddies (&quot;mes amis du quartier&quot;) he formed Zaiko Langa Langa. This band broke with many of the previous conventions of the music, using a strong team of vocalists and electric instruments to create complex cross-harmonies around themes which drew on both folk roots and American and Latin pop. And floating over the top of Zaiko's sound was a high-pitched, soulful male voice: the voice of Papa Wemba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other bands followed: the rootsy Isifi Lokole and the radical fusion of Viva La Musica. Always, that voice haunted the music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But his third album, Emotion, marks an even more radical departure for the now Paris-based singer. &quot;This one is universal music: music to appeal to Africans, Americans, Asians. We need to enlarge the audience for Zairean music.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He feels it's artificial to deny the cross- fertilisations which have been taking place throughout his lifetime between African, American and European music and, like Manu Dibango before him, feels the emergence of an &quot;electric Africa&quot; must be acknowledged. &quot;The synthesiser is expanding the range of what our Zairean bands can do -- and besides,&quot; he shrugs, &quot;that's the way the world is going and we too must participate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's possibly his time as a mourning singer that has given Papa Wemba's voice its unique timbre: his choice on Emotion of the Otis Redding ballad Fa Fa Fa Fa Fa (Sad Song) clearly draws out the vocal parallels with American gospel choir graduates like Redding himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Papa Wemba is emphatic that he cannot leave his African roots behind. &quot;There's no single genre of African music. In the north, east, west, the south and the centre, African singers are drawing on their distinctive heritages to create new things every day. And this music is still largely unexploited.&quot; Looking wistful (and sounding uncannily like the South African musicians fighting similar battles with our own ministry of culture), he asserts: &quot;If our politicians could only realise that music is an industry, and give it the resources it needs, we could be contributing to economies in a major way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So far, Papa Wemba has mainly encountered the vocal music of South Africa, and particularly the voice of one heroine: &quot;Ah! Miriam Makeba! What can I say about her? She's quite simply the first lady of song in Africa.&quot; But he's hoping that his visits to education centres like Funda in Soweto next week &quot;will let me meet young musicians. I'm interested to hear what new sounds are developing here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And he sees a common thread in the work African musicians are doing across the continent. &quot;We take from rural music and we make new things from it. Soukous is a modern music -- we took it in a different direction from its origins. But traditional music remains. It's always there, a deep wellspring to refresh our creativity with something of the spirit.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - &quot;Writing about art is like dancing about architecture,&quot; said Anon. True; though not in the cynically negative sense here intended.  That writing about art is -- or can be -- an art form in itself, would seem to be part of the intriguing concept behind the exhibition Three Artists, Three Authors and its accompanying book, Three Sculptors, Three Readers; that, and the idea that in the 20th century, in Arthur Danto's words, &quot;an object is an artwork only under interpretation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ostensibly an exploration of the process of making artworks more accessible (to those, according to the introduction, who are not &quot;intellectuals, the cognoscenti, the intelligentsia, the elite&quot; -- to which I will return), this exhibition provides as well an opportunity for exploring other crucial questions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How, for instance, do interpretations by art historians and critics affect our own reception of artworks, our looking? In this mediated viewing, is the activity of &quot;seeing&quot; then placed at a remove; predetermined and predefined; or enhanced and enriched? Much, obviously, depends on the nature of that mediation. We have three &quot;readers&quot; here. Although they have much -- perhaps too much -- in common, they also differ significantly in approach, which here enables us to compare some of these processes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rory Doepel, first, writes about the work of Neels Coetzee. Essentially, Doepel's discussion, culminating in Coetzee's last monumental piece, Crucible, provides a genealogy of ideas. He traces these through earlier works and preparatory stages, to the final product. Interesting as these may be, the question must be asked: with what status does this lineage imbue the work itself? What role does it play in the work's &quot;succeeding&quot;? No apparent (or explicit) judgment is offered; but the exclusion of criticality is perhaps problematic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Crucible, for instance, is beset with formal and conceptual difficulties. Incongruities -- - of scale, of stylistic approach, of technical approach -- are unresolved, making of this work a shotgun wedding of disparate parts. The pedigree of each part does not save it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Doepel, though speaking with enormous authority and knowledge, appears to speak entirely and directly for the artist. Having spent vast amounts of time in discussion with him, the necessary distance might easily be lost. The result is that the viewer's response, too, is proscribed. And yet a sense of physical engagement with the materials (for example, with the actual process of developing the skull forms) is very potent: an image which remains in the memory as one examines these works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elizabeth Rankin's style is very different: her writing about Walter Oltmann's work is literary, almost poetic, making space for her own imaginative responses to Oltmann's suggestively narrative pieces. Colonial associations with his iconography, and a multiplicity of cultural and gender connotations with his weaving technique -- all become bound, in her narrative, within Oltmann's own family history, in itself a richly woven story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oltmann's works, and Rankin's interpretations of them, seem highly personal, but they are not private. And because both his content and his technique refer -- albeit strangely -- to comforting things, the sculptures draw the viewer into them even while appearing to disturb. The viewer's participatory role in the communication is thus assured; while the text constructs possibilities, not closures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reingard Nethersole writes about the artist Peter SchUtz, in a piece of writing structured, in itself, as a narrative or a journey. At first seeing SchUtz's works as an &quot;outsider&quot;, in terms of their immediate physical appearance, then noticing their qualities of strangeness, their disconcerting conjunctions, their interconnectedness, she seeks out SchUtz's thought-processes, his &quot;(re)collections&quot;, his things, his icons; and finally revisits each work with the language that they speak, in order to understand them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is almost exclusively the iconography of SchUtz's work that concerns and interests Nethersole: the migration of images from the world this artist inhabits, into his artwork, and over time from one series into another. The visible world, minutiae, SchUtz's physical observations, translated into wood, become signifiers of meaning (the folded ear, for example, on a skinned zebra-head ...) in his pervasive &quot;ethical imperative&quot;: his driving rejection of man's destruction of nature, and of animals. It is with fascination that these submerged reservoirs of narrative content are exposed to view. And Nethersole's own sense of fascinated discovery, its richness, is remarkably conveyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nevertheless, there are among SchUtz's works pieces that do not visually resonate with the significance &quot;within&quot; them; and which are drained of formal interest as soon as their texts are no longer current in one's mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But if that is a limitation of the viewer, this exhibition stands as an admirable concept. The reality, however, seems to be that although -- as is usual -- the &quot;common viewer&quot; may gaze upon the images free of charge, the book at R49,99 is an unthinkable purchase for many. And the walls, and every other visible surface, remain pristinely free of explanatory words or voices.  For a good proportion of the potential audience (who would very probably fall outside of the &quot;cognoscenti, the intelligentsia, and the elite&quot; group mentioned in the introduction) the concept of &quot;readers&quot; is defeated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Can one have too much understanding? Danto, to impress upon his readers the impact of text on perceiving artworks, proposed seven &quot;readings&quot; of a red panel: the Egyptians drowning in the Red Sea; Kierkegaard's mood; The Red Square, a Moscow landscape; Red Square, a minimalist painting; an image of Nirvana; Red Table Cloth, a still life; red, a paint sample.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Three Artists, Three Authors, the works are too specific and perhaps already too &quot;legible&quot; for so dramatic an impact; the texts nevertheless affect one's reading of this exhibition in interesting ways. My own experience was a heightened sensitivity to something I had previously only ever experienced in exhibitions of African masks and artifacts, or in a theatre: the awareness that, like props or sets, waiting for something inexorably to happen, these objects were the mere physical representatives of something far removed from here.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - When Geoff Budlender visited one of the many trials of Barney Pityana in the early 1970s, he ran into his fellow student-leader's mother, whom he did not recognise but who clearly seemed to know him. She revealed herself as Budlender's aunt's domestic worker, and told Geoff that he and Barney often used to play together as kids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the time, Budlender was a leader of the National Union of South African Students (Nusas), and Pityana was a leader of the South African Students Organisation (Saso) -- the organisation, founded by himself and Steve Biko, that had led black students out of &quot;nonracial&quot; union with Nusas.  Relations between the two organisations were immensely fraught and, remembers Budlender, &quot;what amazed me about Barney is that in our debates he never used it against me that I was the madam's child who didn't remember the nanny.  What made Barney so extraordinary is that he showed us that you could be pro-black without being anti-white. He never personalised the issues ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Twenty-five years later, Barney Pityana has attained notoriety (or fame, depending on which way you look at it), by going onto national television, in the very week he was appointed chairman of the Human Rights Commission (HRC), and branding legal academic Dennis Davis a &quot;racist&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Davis is one of South Africa's most celebrated left-wing lawyers, a pro bono legal counsel to the labour movement, a stalwart of the United Democratic Front. Pityana is an ordained priest, a theology Ph.D, a political visionary and the former head of the World Council of Churches' Programme to Combat Racism. Both are mensches; the former an archetypal Jewish intellectual, the latter an archetypal Anglican cleric. If Davis is volatile, impassioned and not a little shrill, then Pityana is temperate, modulated and not a little sanctimonious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their public row was a searing and painful spectacle of the dominant political debate of our times. Both men came to embody racial composites representing Black Rage and White Racism, Grasping Black Arrogance and Sneering White Cynicism. There on our TV screens, hovering over the befuddled head of Max du Preez, were all the genies we thought had been tightly bottled by our official ideologies of Reconciliation and Nonracialism. There was the dreadful reality writ large: democracy has not freed us from the race-bound shackles of our past; we all still live in Potgietersrus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The accusations are even more acute than they were during the Wits University debate, but the lines are less clearly drawn. Political columnists Mondli Makhanya and Wilmot James, both black, have slammed Pityana for ill- advisedly playing the race card against a man who, they believe, has displayed no evidence of racism. One black colleague of mine believes Pityana's attack is &quot;the right battle, but badly fought&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Sunday, however, I listened to Radio Metro deejay Grant Shokoane tell hundreds of thousand of listeners about how Pityana had made his week by telling Davis exactly where to get off. If Davis wanted to leave the country, said Grant, well &quot;good riddance&quot;. Either Shokoane and I watched different debates or we truly live in different countries: in the Focus debate I saw, Pityana was manifestly unable to substantiate his claims that Davis had been motivated by racism into criticising the HRC's composition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, however, Pityana's phone was ringing off the hook. ANC officials who know Davis might be &quot;horrified&quot;, as one very senior (black) source told me, at Pityana's &quot;error of judgment&quot;; many others see him as the standard-bearer of a new campaign against racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Barney Pityana I met was clever, engaging, affable, not in the slightest bit defensive, and imbued with a quiet strength that gives way, very frequently, to a hearty guffaw. Around 50, he is of youthful demeanour yet well on his way to clerical avuncularity: if he were my shepherd I'd feel safe in his flock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He will go back and read the offending article, he says, and if he was wrong he will publicly apologise. In the meanwhile, he is &quot;delighted&quot; that this has all happened in the very week of his inauguration because &quot;as the Human Rights Commission, we have an obligation to raise awareness of how things work in our society or we'll never be able to deal with them ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pityana's mission is to to get South Africans to acknowledge that we are all victims or perpetrators of more subtle manifestations of racism than the crude Potgietersrus variety. Pityana, remember, was Steve Biko's other political half. Together they pioneered the notion, in South Africa, of racism as a culturally embedded phenomenon rather than simply a political force. Although he entered the Black Consciousness Movement via the ANC at Lovedale and in his native New Brighton township, and although he strenuously resisted the notion of black separatism to begin with, his political work in the student movement was to challenge not the brute force of the apartheid regime, but the more subliminal racism of &quot;our liberal friends in Nusas&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Budlender writes, in a collection on the legacy of Steve Biko co-edited by Pityana, that &quot;the feeling of rejection was painful and profound&quot; for white liberals. &quot;Part of the pain was caused by the fact that so much of the Black Consciousness rhetoric and argument seemed to be aimed directly at white liberals rather than at government supporters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Plus a change: Pityana used the inauguration of the commission last Thursday to eulogise the Freedom Front's Chris De Jager, who has since left the HRC for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Davis had slammed the Volkstater's appointment, but, says Pityana, De Yager was &quot;a model member of the HRC ... we actually marvelled at his capacity -- and this is part of my anger with Davis - -- to really come to understand, to work within what the changes of our country are about&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He allows that conservative Afrikaners, for reasons both cultural (they respect authority) and strategic (they understand where the new power lies), are more likely to be acquiescent to the new power elite than bolshy lefties like Dennis Davis. But sometimes, says Pityana, &quot;my liberal friends still seem to operate from a paradigm of the past. They've contributed so much to the struggle that they've now become intolerant of viewpoints different to their own. They're intolerant of Afrikaners coming in to participate, and they're intolerant of the class they often perjoratively call the black elite.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After their televised row, Pityana and Davis had something of a rapprochement in the SABC parking lot: &quot;I told him,&quot; says Davis, &quot;that I found it deeply ironic that he should lash out at me in this way. When I came to university in 1970, the Black Consciousness Movement had just got going, and it had a profound effect on me -- it made me rethink liberalism and moved me towards Marxism. What is ironic is that I'm not a liberal because of you, Barney Pityana!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The point, says Davis -- who stands by his criticism of the HRC -- is that &quot;there's a huge dichotomy between nation-building and democratic culture. Pityana is angry with me for criticising nation-building. Of course you've got to have nation-building, the Bafana Bafana thing, but if you run away with that and get intoxicated by it, you lose the context of a democratic culture. You cheer thoughtlessly for the home team rather than holding it accountable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If indeed Pityana is to be a thoughtless cheerleader for the government policy, then he is the wrong person to head a statutory body that has been set up to protect ordinary South Africans against human rights violations. A project that will, sooner rather than later, bring it into conflict with the state. But the vision Pityana articulates for his commission is precisely one that will hold the government to account. The commission has more powers than any other of its kind worldwide -- not only powers of search and seizure, but the right to intervene directly in the legislative process and to call government officials to account for policy decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under his guidance, it has expanded its brief &quot;beyond just taking complaints of violations. We're going to find out what socio-economic human rights are being violated, and be proactive about solutions.&quot; By the end of this year, he envisages a head office staff of 39, and offices in every province. If there has been a slow start, he says, this is because of bureaucratic red tape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a bigheartedness, a broadness of vision, to Pityana that is difficult to square with the extremity of his rage over Davis's criticism.  He is, in fact, an ecumenical humanist at heart. In his doctoral thesis on transition and theology, accepted by the University of Cape Town last year, he exclaims in a delightfully unscholarly way, &quot;I love freedom. Being free to think and act according to one's conscience. A religion that imprisons the mind will fail to capture my imagination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is, in fact, a lawyer by training, but he soon came to see its limitations. He recounts a seminal moment in his life -- when Desmond Tutu, chaplain at Fort Hare, crossed a barricade of policemen, to be with protesting students in 1968: &quot;I saw that as a lawyer, I'd always be pushing against the bounds of possibility, fighting with a law intent on limiting my sphere of activity ... But for meaningful human existence, you have to be transcendent, you have to think beyond what is possible.&quot; The transcendent image of a levitating Bishop Tutu, faith-sailing over the barricades, seems to have powered his decision to become a cleric: in 1978 he left the country after five years of banning and detention to study theology at London University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, say those who know him, much of his ire at Dennis Davis is rooted in an irritation at the self-righteousness of white leftie lawyers who think they liberated the country, and who are currently writing the Constitution in a process to which blacks remain marginal. Fellow commissioners recall that, at roughly the same moment he fired his salvo at the Mail &amp; Guardian and Davis, he lost his temper for the first and only time within the commission: in response to some white members' complaints that they were being deliberately left out of the appointments process. He even snapped at Helen Suzman: &quot;You thought we couldn't make a good appointment without you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His approach, says one commissioner, &quot;was to deal, there and then, with what he perceived to be ingrained racism.&quot; A friend talks about the racial slights he and his family -- used to the gentility of Milton Keynes (where he was a curate) and Geneva -- have endured since returning to South Africa: &quot;The Davis criticism was the last straw,&quot; the friend says. &quot;And while I personally believe Barney maybe acted ill-advisedly, I know one thing for sure: he gets angry so rarely, that when it happens, you need to sit up and take notice. There's something going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is most definitely something going on. It's the second wave of Black Consciousness, and it makes sense that one of the prime originators of the first wave has emerged as its most strident advocate. He is a man intent on linking the tenets of an earlier age of struggle --psychological liberation, the combating of racist culture -- to the current reality of the political power that black people have and the economic empowerment and control over their destinies many of them seek. He is a Steve Biko for the Nineties.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> M'membe and Mwape, respectively the managing editor and editor-in-chief of the independent daily The Post, have spent 24 days in maximum security jails, after the speaker of Parliament ordered their arrest in connection with The Post's criticism of remarks made in Parliament.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They were arrested in terms of a law allowing for indefinite detention, but on Wednesday they obtained a habeus corpus writ enabling their release.  Judge Kabazo Chanda ruled that according to the laws of natural justice it was unreasonable to imprison the editors indefinitely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the judge also declared that an article written by M'membe was in contravention of parliamentary privilege laws, and that Parliament must make a complaint with the Director of Public Prosecutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The article written by columnist Lucy Sichone, who has avoided arrest by going into hiding, was similarly in breach of the law, but Mwape's was not, the judge ruled. Sichone should appear before Parliament when sittings resume on April 13, the judge advised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shortly before the journalists' release, the International Press Institute, which represents editors and publishers from 85 countries, called for the journalists to be freed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This week the case of Zambia was considered by the United Nations Human Rights Committee (UNHRC). The Zambian chapter of the Media Institute of Southern Africa wrote to UNHCR expressing concern about &quot;the dramatic deterioration in media freedom and free expression in Zambia&quot;, while a report to UNHRC by Amnesty International drew attention to the government's failure to meet a range of human rights obligations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - When the telephone rang in Austin Abada's sparsely furnished Cape Town flat this week, it heralded news as familiar as it was terrible. Abada, a Nigerian student leader seeking asylum in South Africa after fleeing his country as a wanted man last month, learned of yet another crackdown by state security forces at his alma mater, Nigeria's Benin University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I was told that two students had been shot dead after a student protest,&quot; he said. &quot;The student movement is presenting the only real challenge to (General Sani Abacha's) regime at present and the government wants to crush it at all costs.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abada (26) has a photograph of himself showing scars from beatings he received at the hands of Nigerian security forces during the 11 months he spent detained without trial. Compatriots of his in the Campaign for Student Liberties, the organisation he helped found in response to &quot;the state's assault on the student movement&quot;, were in hiding this week to avoid similar fates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Registered for an economics degree at the University of Cape Town, Abada's future lies in the hands of the Department of Home Affairs. He has applied for political asylum. A temporary permit has allowed him to take up a scholarship sponsored by a German church organisation. But if his application for asylum is rejected, he faces deportation and criminal charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am supposed to be on trial back home for armed robbery, arson and incitement,&quot; Abada told the Mail &amp; Guardian. &quot;A conviction for armed robbery carries the death sentence. It is the way things are made to look legal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His uncertainty about his future is overshadowed, however, by his frustration at the apparent inability of South Africa and the international community as a whole to turn the diplomatic screws on Abacha's regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have lost faith in various governments and are relying on non-governmental organisations to assist our people back home in finding their way out of their predicament. The West is doing nothing -- because it gets cheap oil from Nigeria. The other African countries don't want to act because of the patronage they have received from Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The solution to our problems does not lie with foreign intervention as such, but in complementary actions that assist the pro- democracy movements in Nigeria. They need moral and logistical support. It is true the pro-democracy opposition is fragmented. The problem has always been one of lack of trust and no mutually agreed strategy. But the groups are more united than they have ever been.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'The Nigerian crisis is a very serious one. We are saying something can be done by nations acting in concert and imposing sanctions, especially on oil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Representatives of exiled Nigerian opposition groupings based in South Africa, Europe and the United States, will be attending a three- day meeting in Johannesburg this weekend, according to the African National Congress's international affairs department head, Yusuf Salojee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organised by the South African-Nigerian Democratic Support Group launched in response to the executions in November last year of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni activists, the meeting was &quot;an attempt to bring Nigerian opposition groups together and strategise a way forward&quot;, Salojee said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African MPs and members of the ANC-South African Communist Party-Cosatu alliance would also take part. &quot;Right now things are in limbo.  We are very sensitive to the issue of human rights abuses in Nigeria, but in terms of taking action we need to be sensitive to the thinking of other African countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Southern African Development Community was reluctant to take a stand, and the Organisation for African Unity was &quot;not moving&quot; on the issue, Salojee said. Plans for an ANC delegation to visit Nigeria had not been shelved, but &quot;members would need visas issued by the existing Nigerian authorities who want us to come with a very clear agenda and to say who we want to meet&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South African government's lack of action on the Nigerian issue is dictated largely by its concerns about the feelings of its African neighbours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No other African country was prepared to back President Nelson Mandela's calls for sanctions against the Nigerian junta. Diplomatically, South Africa found itself out on a limb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abada laments the fact that the government's expressed commitment to human rights appears to be held in thrall by the baser, economically driven concerns of its fellow African countries. Until efforts to create a united African position on Nigeria bear fruit, however, he must wait, and hope -- and brace himself for inevitable bad tidings from his homeland.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - African National Congress MP Willie Hofmeyr's eyes are large pools of limpid exhaustion as he gazes onto the first page of the Bill of Rights. Wearily he picks up a pen and starts: &quot;We have made progress ...  here, we've taken out that word there, and we have brought this clause round here.&quot; Flicking through the pages, he ticks the Freedom of Expression clause, makes a grammatical change in the Freedom of Religion clause and ticks one word in the Freedom of Occupation clause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These changes -- which on paper seem so small and technical -- represent the progress made after weeks of hard bargaining between the party negotiators on the Bill of Rights, as they edge forward to agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Hofmeyr turns to the Property clause, he just passes his hands over the clause and murmurs under his breath, &quot;too sensitive, too sensitive to even talk about&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Property clause This has become the site of intense struggle between the political parties, the ANC essentially fearing that a property clause would stand in the way of state-driven land reform and the National Party, Freedom Front and the Democratic Party concerned that a property clause was needed as a neccessary protection for property-owners against the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The parties are, in devising a formulation, trying to balance the two positions as well as write into the Constitution the sort of compensation neccessary should the state expropriate land. The fact that there is a property clause in the Bill of Rights indicates a major concession from the ANC, which originally opposed it being there at all, with backing in that stand from Cosatu. Whatever the final formulation, it is expected that the ANC negotiators will have to do a hard-sell to convince their constituents of the outcome. This is not a clause which will be resolved easily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Right to Life This is a major stumbling block within the Bill of Rights because it has political implications for the death penalty and abortion. The key disagreement is between the ANC and the NP. The ANC is opting for a clause that simply says: &quot;Everyone has the right to life.&quot; The Nats want a formulation that makes the death sentence possible. This issue has been deadlocked, and there are hopes that parties will find agreement in Arniston.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Democratic Party's chief rights negotiator Dene Smuts says she believes the only way to move from this impasse is to opt for &quot;everyone has the right to life&quot;, because the deadlock of principle between the ANC and the NP is, in her view, implacable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Interestingly enough, since November last year, the Constitutional Assembly has received 186 376 petitions in support of the constitutionalisation of the death penalty, and 9 604 petitions calling for the right to life to outlaw abortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Freedom and Security of the Person At this late stage, this right remains contentious because it could have an impact on future abortion legislation, although the issues affected by the right go much further than that, and include protection from torture and detention without trial. While none of the parties wants the right to abortion on demand constitutionalised, the NP is concerned that the right, as it is currently drafted, could tilt judgments on future legislation towards the liberalisation of abortion.  Insiders say internal disputes within the NP will have to be resolved before this clause is finalised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Labour Relations In an uncanny repeat of the multi-party negotiations at the World Trade Centre, disagreements over the right to strike and the right to lock-out are blocking consensus on the Labour Relations clause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC is arguing that there is no international precedent to the right to lock- out and therefore it ought not to be in the Bill. Further, the ANC argues that the property right gives employers control over who is on their property so there is no further need for a right to lock-out to be entrenched in the Bill of Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The DP is arguing that writing the right to strike into the constitution and not the right to lock-out will give the right to strike greater influence in the common law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If the one -- the right to strike -- is constitutionalised and not the other, then the equivalence see-saws out of balance,&quot; said Smuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Limitation of Rights This section of the Bill of Rights remains highly sensitive because it limits the extent to which the executive or Parliament can override the Bill of Rights to implement legislation considered important for the running of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recently, a formulation has been found that appears at this stage to satisfy all parties, following lengthy tussles between the ANC and the DP about the extent to which rights could be limited, the DP wanting a stricter test than the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC has justified its position on the Limitation clause, saying, by way of an example, that the Bill of Rights ought not to stand in the way of legislation aimed at beefing up policing powers to reduce crime. In response to criticism that the Limitation clause waters down the Bill of Rights, Hofmeyr responds: &quot;We don't think that in South Africa rights should be as broadly defined as in a stable democracy such as the United States ... but the limitations clause puts us solidly where the vast majority of democratic rights- based countries are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The DP's Smuts says the solution lies in moving to a formulation which ensures that rights are invaded as little as is reasonably possible. &quot;If there is a weak limitation clause, all your rights can be bled to a point where they constitute haemorrhage and cannot be applied,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Smuts believes that the recent formulation of the Limitiations clause which proposes a &quot;proportionality mechanism&quot; succeeds in saving the Bill of Rights from over-limitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The scaffolding supporting the Bill of Rights NGOs and commentators are increasingly concerned that politicians will have too much influence over the institutions created by the Constitution to uphold the Bill of Rights. While the method of appointment is not finally signed and sealed, the clause in the fourth draft dictates that the Public Protector, the Auditor General and the members of the Human Rights Commission, the Commission for Gender Equality and the Electoral Commission are to be appointed by parliamentary committees, staffed by politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Professor Jeremy Sarkin, the national chair of the Human Rights Committee, believes this method of appointment is dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Each political party chooses one person to suit their own ideological position and then he is their person and through them the politicians can control the commissions. This will weaken the groups that are meant to be checking that the politicians uphold the Bill of Rights ... What we need is for those commissions to be chosen by civil society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Politicians involved in the negotiations disagree with Sarkin. Both Hofmeyr of the ANC and Douglas Gibson of the DP retort: &quot;As MPs, politicians are the elected representatives of civil society, so therefore we are well placed to make the selection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Rights That Didn't Make It</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the first working draft of the Constitution was distributed in November last year, submissions have been pouring in to the Constitutional Assembly offering more proposals for the negotiators to work with, some of which have been ignored. These are the suggestions that have not made it into the Bill of Rights:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1) Freedom of the individual from prohibitive taxes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2) A clause to protect the aged</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3) Students' rights to organise other students</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4) The right to play sport</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5) The right to leisure, rest and holidays</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6) The right to own firearms and the right to self-defence. (The Constitutional Assembly received 14 410 submissions calling for the right to own firearms to be protected by the constitution.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 7) The protection of the rights of Rastafarians</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 8) The protection of animal rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 9) The right to breastfeed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NGOs continue to complain that the Constitutional Assembly has appealed for input from the public, but is not prepared to engage in public dialogue on what has been submitted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Two of the Cameron Commission's key recommendations to lift the veil of secrecy on South Africa' s arms export industry failed to find support in Cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Water Affairs Minister Kader Asmal -- who heads the Cabinet committee scrutinising arms trade policy and arms export applications -- had already rejected elements of the the Cameron Commissions's proposals in Parliament by the time the report was officially released and presented to the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asmal had told a Parliamentary Defence Committee his Cabinet committee -- the National Conventional Arms Control Committee (NCACC) -- disagreed with the report's proposal that parliamentarians be given the power to review and veto arms sales.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asmal said he did not think it neccessary for Parliament to have this oversight capacity, because the public should trust &quot;the intuition of the 13 cabinet ministers on the NCACC&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cameron Commissioner Laurie Nathan believes parliamentary oversight of arms exports is essential as &quot;an independent evaluation and it is probably the most effective way of safe- guarding human rights and international security concerns&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asmal has also rejected the commission's proposal to classify countries according to their status as potential customers: those to whom arms should not be sold, those to whom arms could be sold and those where the situation is unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asmal has said that to publish such a list would be to create diplomatic tensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The head of the Institute for Defence Policy, Jakkie Cilliers, supports the commission in this instance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He believes processing arms export permit applications cases by case, as the NCACC is doing, will inevitably lead to inconsistency in decision-making.  &quot;This approach becomes a logistical nightmare and creates a logjam in the processing of applications for marketing and export permits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cilliers believes there are some excellent recommendations in the Cameron Commission but his chief criticism is that the report is written from an ideological position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It was written ... to restrict the sale of weapons.&quot; he says. &quot;If the commission's recommendation were implemented in their entirety, they would ultimately shut down the defence industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - A political row is brewing over Minister of Foreign Affairs Alfred Nzo's visit to China, with questions to be asked in Parliament as to why his delegation included four African National Congress MPs.  Questions have also been raised over the timing of the visit, ordered at President Nelson Mandela's behest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC MP Raymond Suttner, chair of Parliament's Foreign Affairs Portfolio Committee, and fellow committee members, Danny Jordaan and Max Sisulu, went on the trip -- the first to Beijing by a South African foreign minister. MP Blade Nzimande, who chairs the ANC's national executive sub-committee on foreign affairs, also went.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National Party foreign affairs spokesman Dr Boy Geldenhuys told the Mail &amp; Guardian he was tabling questions in Parliament about the delegation and its composition, as it clearly did not reflect the Government of National Unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If the ANC wanted to visit Beijing that would be fine, but if the government is sending a delegation overseas with a view to giving advice to the GNU it should at least reflect all parties,&quot; said Geldenhuys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking the day he returned to South Africa from his 48-hour trip, during which he met with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi, Nzo told the Mail &amp; Guardian the composition of the delegation -- - which included Foreign Affairs officials -- - had been decided by Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He decided to broaden it (to include the ANC MPs),&quot; Nzo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Nzo's visit was long overdue, questions have been raised about it taking place at a time when relations between Taiwan and Beijing were particularly fraught. The initial plan was for the trip to include a visit to Taiwan, but the South Africans could not be accommodated because of the presidential elections there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Geldenhuys criticised the timing. &quot;At a time when the whole world was distancing itself from China because it was threatening Taiwan with the use of live ammunition, we send a government delegation. What kind of message does that send?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign Affairs officials maintained Nzo's schedule prevented any changes. Nzo said the trip had been planned &quot;long before anyone thought missiles would start flying&quot;. A delegation would go to Taiwan as soon as it could be arranged, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dismissing reports which indicated that he had signalled, while in Beijing, that South Africa intended forging diplomatic ties with mainland China, Nzo stressed the visit was &quot;a fact- finding mission&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nzo said he would only provide details when he had made his report to Mandela &quot;and then South Africa will get to know what the state of relations are between ourselves and China and Taiwan&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, he did confirm that he had conveyed to Beijing Mandela's willingness to mediate between Beijing and Taiwan in the dispute which has seen them at loggerheads since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, when the nationalist Kuomintang fled to Taiwan and set up the Republic of China, while Mao Zedong formed the communist People's Republic of China on the mainland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They themselves say the problem is an internal one,&quot; Nzo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The issue of the two Chinas is possibly South Africa's most pressing diplomatic dilemma at present. Foreign analysts hold the view that South Africa cannot continue to deny the existence of a world power that occupies a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, has the world's largest population, possesses a nuclear capability and boasts one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's long-standing relationship with Taiwan is a product of both countries' one- time pariah status among nations. However, while Taiwan has successfully spent the last decade democratising, China's human rights record has been poor -- though some analysts believe this should not be a reason to avoid diplomatic ties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For South Africa, the challenge is that no country has yet succeeded in being able to maintain relations with both China and Taiwan, as this would imply there were two Chinas -- and Beijing has always insisted there is only one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa is the most significant of the 31 countries that recognise Taiwan, and Taipei is desperate for the relationship to continue. To this end it has been extremely generous with aid and was one of the countries which made substantial donations to the ANC to help it fight the 1994 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is sometimes argued that Chinese support for the ANC during its struggle against apartheid should be considered a factor. But the head of the ANC's international affairs department, Yusuf Salojee, said this week that Chinese support amounted to little more than backing UN resolutions. &quot;We got no logistical or financial support from China. Even a small country like Cuba gave us more assistance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that during &quot;the height of the struggle&quot; in the mid-1980s China had sold AK- 47s to the South African Defence Force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's diplomatic challenge is that no country has yet succeeded in being able to maintain relations with both China and Taiwan, which the mainland sees as a renegade province. Beijing insists that formal ties with Taiwan must first be broken before diplomatic relations can be forged with itself.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The old academic slanging match between excellence and relevance took on a new form this week when a South African scientist condemned the new Academy of Science of South Africa (Assa) as &quot;elitist and unrepresentative&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Assa, launched this week as an initiative to unite South African scientists across ethnic lines, was lauded by Nobel Prize winners and scientific academies from around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Until now, South Africa's scientific community has been divided between the (white Anglo) Royal Society of South Africa, the (black) Science and Engineering Academy of South Africa (Seasa) and the (white Afrikaner) Suid- Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns. But Seasa chairman Dr Gordon Sibiya has issued a statement distancing himself from the new organisation, and denying earlier reports that Seasa had given its support to the formation of ASSA.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Seasa represents some black scientists, it is primarily an educational body. In his statement Sibiya set out Seasa's track record in providing science education to South African youth, an achievement acknowledged by Assa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Assa will, in the words of founder member Dr Reinhard Arndt, &quot;be fearless in its principal mission to serve the community&quot; it aims above all to harness the minds and energies of the most able practitioners of scientific thought in the country. Its closed, elected membership, common to science academies all over the world, appears to have drawn the charge of elitism from Sibiya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sibiya, a respected electrical consulting engineer, was invited to join Assa but declined. Had he joined, there would have been a higher percentage of black members, the lack of which he criticised. But for the past two years, Sibiya himself has been involved in the balloting procedure by which the founding members were selected. Sibiya was one of the five Temporary Nominations Committee members which shaped Assa as it now stands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khotso Mokhele (40) rocketed into the limelight, not only as the first president of Assa, but also as the new president of the Foundation for Research and Development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bloemfontein-born microbiologist has specialised in studies of rock cod, mutant strains of Haemophilus influenzae, and biological controls to prevent plant disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Academies from around the world, came to pledge their loyalty at the inaugural meeting in Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The previous South African academies and philosophical societies date back to 1825. Their co-existence was due to a society fragmented in its historical crucible. For now they will co-exist, but it is expected that in the end, only the academy will remain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's mysterious financial circumstances will come under the spotlight when the code of conduct for parliamentarians comes into effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her financial position has been the subject of intense speculation following disclosures in court records in the divorce proceedings with her former husband President Nelson Mandela last week that her monthly expenditure of R107 000 far exceeds her two after-tax salaries -- - as MP (R10 000) and African National Congress Women's League president -- amounting to R16 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now questions are being asked about whether she has additional income and if so, where it comes from. Or, if there is no additional income, whether she is indeed headed for financial ruin. The president is due to make an ex gratia settlement to her, but the amount is unknown.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A request was made for Madikizela-Mandela's financial position to be submitted to the court during the divorce proceedings; instead the court received a record of her salary and monthly expenditure. Although the information furnished was &quot;unsatisfactory&quot;, as a member of Mandela's legal team put it, the dispute over assets was never heard and the matter was laid to rest. &quot;There were a lot of technical issues that we could have taken up but we wanted to get the case over,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More clarity on Madikizela-Mandela's financial position may be forthcoming once Parliament's joint Rules Committee of Senate and the National Assembly reaches agreement on a code of ethics. This will compel MPs to disclose financial and other interests which could have a bearing on the way they perform their public duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such information will soon have to be disclosed in a register available for public scrutiny. Although agreement was expected to be reached on the code of conduct this week, some issues are still being debated by the parties. The Inkatha Freedom Party, National Party and the Democratic Party oppose the disclosure of the value of residential property ownership and state pensions, while the ANC and Pan African Congress are all for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC has spearheaded the move for public disclosures of this kind, but over the months general consensus has emerged among the parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other issues still to be agreed on are the extent to which disclosure extends to MPs' families and the mechanism for and composition of those in charge of enforcing the code. A consultant lawyer, Hugh Corder, was appointed this week by the committee to draw up the new rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry Kader Asmal, who headed the sub-committee which drafted the code, told the Mail &amp; Guardian he was &quot;acutely disappointed&quot; at the delay in adopting the code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Richard Calland, head of Parliamentary Information and Monitoring Service (Pims), said it was &quot;frustrating that the code of conduct is still not finally resolved&quot;. The delay, said Calland, was partly due to the chairmanship of President of Senate Kobie Coetsee who &quot;does not have a clear grasp of the issues of substance and was not effective in facilitating a speedy resolution of the issues&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the question of Madikizela-Mandela, Calland said it was important to distinguish between &quot;politics of envy and politics of accountability. Wealth in itself is not important. What is important are the sources of wealth and whether or not they affect the way in which public officials perform their duties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The code of conduct, said Calland, was about &quot;finding mechanisms to reduce a conflict of interests affecting the way that public officials perform their duties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mike Ellis, DP representative on the parliamentary committee on Ethics, said Madikzela-Mandela's financial situation should be investigated. He said she was now under &quot;extreme pressure to indicate where those sources of wealth come from to enable her to have the extraordinary lifestyle that she does&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ellis said he doubted whether Mandela's financial transactions complied with the ANC's own strict code of conduct for its MPs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the ANC's code, all its MPs must declare assets to the organisation and any other positions they occupy where financial gain is involved. They can be ordered to step down if they contravene the code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The secretary general of the ANC shall establish a register of financial interests which shall be accessible to members of the National Executive Committee. In addition, every elected member shall register any gift which exceeds the value of R200 in such a register,&quot; reads the code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All ANC MPs were requested to disclose this information when they took office in Parliament. Assistant to ANC secretary general Cyril Ramaphosa, Donne Cooney, could not confirm whether Madikizela-Mandela had made disclosures to the NEC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC representative Ronnie Mamoepa would not be drawn on whether he had signed. &quot;I have no reason to believe that there were people who did not sign the assets register,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking in his capacity as chairman of the ANC's disciplinary committee, Asmal said action could only be taken against an MP when &quot;a matter was referred to it by the NEC, the National Working Committee, officials or a province&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC deputy chief whip Naledi Pandor said the organisation's monitoring of its MPs had so far focused mainly on tightening up checks around overseas travel and that updated disclosures around finances and gifts contained an &quot;element of voluntary declaration ... Maybe our machinery is not yet as tight as it should be,&quot; said Pandor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Opening the Durban Supreme Court trial of former defence minister Magnus Malan and 19 others earlier this month, KwaZulu-Natal Attorney General Tim McNally declared that &quot;justice is a priceless commodity&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the value of justice may be &quot;too great to be measured&quot;, the price of reconciliation is far more tangible -- and rising, with the South African taxpayer footing the bill. So far the defence of 19 accused by at least 18 lawyers -- many of whom cut their legal teeth in the service of apartheid -- has cost the state at least R1,8-million in 12 court days to date with final costs due to be at least R7-million if the case ends in three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of the 20 accused, only Inkatha Freedom Party deputy secretary general Zakhele &quot;MZ&quot; Khumalo appears to have secured his own funds to pay Advocate Jeff Hewitt, SC, former Durban Regional Court prosecutor Mike Lasich and IFP attorney Patrick Falconer. This leaves the state holding the bag for six of the seven high-powered legal teams -- and the accused are getting the best defence their former employers could provide.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former Tranvaaal Attorney General Klaus Von Lieres rose to the challenge of defending the six alleged Inkatha Freedom Party hit-squad members among the accused despite having retired on grounds of ill-health last year. The Legal Aid Board is paying his fees, as well as those of instructing attorney, IFP MP Koos van der Merwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ministry of Defence also left no stone unturned in its pursuit of the optimal defence teams for Malan and 11 other Defence Force accused, deciding to use four separate teams in consideration of &quot;potential clashes of interest&quot; among the accused, a Defence Force spokesperson said. Sam Maritz, SC -- described by colleagues as &quot;one of the best advocates in the country&quot; -- and his second, Piet de Jager, are known for their defence of police generals in the Harms Commission, while De Jager more recently represented the SADF in the Kumleben Commission of Inquiry into ivory and rhino horn smuggling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Together with Pretoria state attorney Abraham Trumpie, they represent Malan, Colonel Jan van der Merwe and Major-General Neels van Tonder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mike Maritz, SC, who, together with Jaap Cilliers and attorney Chris Naude represents Brigadier John More and Colonel Adrian Victor, is reputed to be &quot;even more accomplished&quot; than his namesake, having an established practice in various branches of law, including civil law through which he has represented Armscor. General Jannie Geldenhuys, Vice- Admiral Dries Putter and General Kat Liebenberg are represented by reputed right-wing Pretoria advocate Hennie de Vos SC, Etienne Coetzee and attorney Percy Rudman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brigadier Cor van Niekerk, Lieutenant-Colonel Dan Griesel and Lieutenant-Colonel Jakes Jacobs are represented by Johan Englebrecht, SC, known for his defence of right-wing mass- murderer Barend Strydom.  Englebrecht is assisted by Tokki van Zyl and attorney Adolf Malan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the constitutional right to a fair trial is widely accepted as a fundamental democratic right, some legal organisations have criticised the &quot;elite&quot; nature of the defence afforded the accused. Durban Legal Resources Centre lawyer Ranjit Purshotam said it appeared the government had &quot;drawn a distinction by defending high-powered accused with high-powered lawyers, while rank-and-file accused get low-powered legal representation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In normal pro deo or legal aid cases, the accused don't get to choose their legal representation, and they don't usually get senior silk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Legal Aid Board -- which confirmed this week it has already paid R87 472 in pre-trial legal fees and expenses to Von Lieres and Van der Merwe for their defence of the six Caprivi-trained accused -- defended its decision.  Peter Brits, a spokesperson for the board, said Legal Aid did not &quot;concern itself with the profile of the case, but rather with how legally difficult the case is&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brits said Legal Aid pays Von Lieres R6 750 each day he appears in court, while Van der Merwe gets R4 050. The combined fees for approximately 12 court days this month amount to R129 600.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The board also pays hourly rates of R300 to Von Lieres, R200 to Dorfling and R180 to Van der Merwe for consultation and preparation outside of court.  While in Durban, the legal team stays at the Durban Club, which Brits said falls within the R300 daily accommodation costs allowed for each lawyer, amounting to about R10 800 for 12 days of accommodation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brits said the team's fees were determined according to a &quot;sliding tariff&quot; accounting for: the complexity of the matter; the anticipated duration of the trial; the number of accused; and the experience of the legal practitioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Malan trial was considered &quot;very complex&quot;, was expected to continue in excess of 25 days, Von Lieres was defending six accused and was senior counsel with more than 10 years experience, all of which accounted for the higher tariff; while the fact that McNally had decided to prosecute affected the decision to employ Von Lieres, said Brits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Purshotam disagreed: &quot;The Malan case is a simple case of murder and killing. If public funds are used, the criteria should be the severity of the crime, not the status of the accused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The four legal teams representing Malan and the other Defence Force accused are also substantial, each comprising a senior advocate at R6 000 per court day; junior advocate at R3 200 to R4 000; and an attorney at approximately R3 600, a South African National Defence Force spokesperson said. The past 12 days in court would have cost the defence force a minimum of R613 800.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lawyers also receive between R600 and R320 per hour each in consultation and preparation fees, depending on their legal ranking, with a single hour of consultation for all four teams costing at least R5 120.  Although the SANDF did not provide current totals, such fees already paid to Von Lieres' team by legal aid suggest more than 100 hours of consultation and preparation. A similar amount for the SANDF teams would cost about R512 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SANDF also pays a R250 daily subsistence allowance to each lawyer, amounting to at least R36 000 so far, while &quot;the accused are being accommodated in a National Defence Force facility near Durban and are entitled to have certain travel and accommodation costs refunded by the state,&quot; the defence spokesperson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A further legal team is employed by the South African Police Services to defend former security policeman Colonel Louis Botha. Advocate Anton Kilian of SAPS Legal Services said the legal costs for the team amounted to R290 202 by the end of February. Kobus Booyens, SC, and junior counsel Johan Wessels, received R5 000 and R3 000 per day, respectively, for pre-trial work, while instructing attorney Leon Venter was employed by the Port Elizabeth state attorney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Booyens -- known in Durban for his defence last year of Inkatha's self-confessed hit- squad killers Romeo Mbambo, Gcina Mkhize, and Israel Hlongwane on whose behalf he argued in mitigation that the three had acted on the orders of high-ranking IFP and KwaZulu Police officials -- will also recieve R80 000 for each month spent in court defending Botha, while Wessels will receive R50 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The state is also footing the R5 000 monthly rent bill for a flat in Durban accommodating the three lawyers, as well as air travel costs for Wessels between Durban and Port Elizabeth. Botha is staying with relatives while in Durban, said Kiliers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National Association of Democratic Lawyers spokesman Krish Govender described the state- funded defence costs as &quot;a travesty of justice and one of the most painful consequences of the negotiated process where the villians of the apartheid state struck a deal with those who carried the flag for justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - It may be only 10 days since his painful divorce from Winnie, but President Mandela has already given plenty of indication that he intends to make up for lost time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Wednesday the Irish President's state visit to South Africa was overshadowed in the popular press back home by news that Mandela, footloose and fancy-free, had playfully proposed to a member of the Irish press corps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Waiting for Robinson's arrival in Cape Town airport from Pretoria on Tuesday morning, Mandela gave a brief interview to members of the Irish media. As he was about to leave he spotted Nicola Byrne, a 28-year-old reporter from Dublin's Sunday Tribune, and his face lit up.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Come over here young lady,&quot; he barked, reaching out to tenderly shake her hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Are you marrried, by the way?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;No I am not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Ah, well you see, I ...&quot; he hesitated, smiling broadly, and the Irish journalists held their breath, waiting for a reference to the divorce that they weren't even allowed to mention. He recollected himself, but went on: &quot;Well if you propose to me I might accept.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Byrne later admitted she had been quite overcome by Mandela's suggestion. &quot;I was very taken aback because it wasn't what I expected in those surroundings. I just blushed and smiled at him, and he smiled at me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Words failed her, she admits. But all things being equal would she marry Nelson Mandela? &quot;Yes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Visiting Robben Island with the Irish president the next day, Byrne was barraged with cellphone calls from Irish newspapers and radio. A photograph has been taken of her sitting on Mandela's bed in his old cell, and one cannot rule out the possibility of a bidding war between Hello magazine and Paris Match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was, in fact, the second time Mandela has singled out Byrne for his attentions. At a breakfast hosted by the Foreign Correspondent's Association in Johannesburg last year, Mandela walked over to her, seated thoughtfully in a corner, and engaged her in conversation, remarking that &quot;you look like a philosopher&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One can only speculate at the recent life experiences that might give Mandela a taste for the more cerebral lady. It is worth remarking, however, that Mandela's ex-wife, Winnie, has never looked at all like a philosopher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Returning to this week, it soon became apparent that Irish ladies have a particular charm for the South African president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even the Irish head of state, the earnest Mary Robinson, was subjected to Mandela's formidable charm. Showing her around Tuynhuys, he seemed to be flirting with the 52-year-old Irish president, teasing her about her well- known feminism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the state banquet that night, Mandela was also heard to address a few gallant remarks to Oda Baylor, Dutch-born wife of the first secretary at the Irish embassy. As one Irish observer noted, if the rand really is dependent on Mandela's health, then it is time to start buying them again.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - A combination of firm policing and delicate negotiations with moderate groups in the Inkatha Freedom Party defied fire-and- brimstone predictions that the ban on traditional weapons would cause chaos at Thursday's march in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By midday, some 10 000 Inkatha supporters converged on the Library Gardens to commemorate the killings at Shell House in 1994, without any serious incidents of violence. Almost all of them were armed with sticks and knobkerries -- with few spears and pangas in evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of those who carried sharpened steel rods had covered the tips with empty beer tins, signifying that the crowd had moved away from the brazen mood that characterised earlier Inkatha marches.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is little doubt that both sides in this week's row over traditional weapons will claim victory. Inkatha demonstrated it can mobilise a massive show of disciplined strength in the heart of Johannesburg -- all of them kitted out with sticks and shields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi's firm stance on the carrying of dangerous weapons clearly also produced results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mail &amp; Guardian has established that officials in the office of Gauteng Premier Tokyo Sexwale held extensive discussions with hostel indunas and Inkatha Freedom Party members loyal to a moderate faction of the Zulu nationalist movement in a bid to woo them away from the party's more bellicose national leadership in the run-up to Thursday's march.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We held talks during the week with the hostel leaders and an Inkatha group in the Transvaal loyal to Musa Myeni, and worked on an agreement that the marchers would carry only sticks and shields,&quot; said one of Sexwale's colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We knew all along that the way in which the march was conducted and its outcome was going to depend on whether another faction headed by Themba Khoza (an IFP hardliner who may shortly be charged in connection with receiving arms from third force agents in the police) would be able to win more support in the hostels where Inkatha organises.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IFP in Gauteng now has two rival factions after a bitter leadership clash between Myeni and Khosa and his allies erupted last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At provincial elections last year, Khosa lost his leadership of the party and was replaced at the time by a German-born businessman, Dietmar Lang. Neither Khoza nor fellow hardliner Humphrey Ndlovu were elected to the IFP Gauteng executive. This election saw Myeni, who had disappeared from sight during the violent run-up to the election, re-emerge from obscurity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The softly-softly negotiation approach with Inkatha's rank-and-file and middle order leadership was clearly designed to supplement Mufamadi's hardline stance in his television debate with KwaZulu-Natal Premier Frank Mdlalose on Tuesday night -- a position that was repeated by his provincial counterpart Jessie Duarte on Wednesday, when she said marchers who violated the ban would be arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Duarte's staff have also been working hard to win the confidence of junior police officers in an effort to ensure that the police force becomes a willing instrument of government policy. This approach received encouraging signals during the run-up to the march, when two police unions issued statements saying they would enforce the ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The national and provincial police ministries also won an important skirmish in their war of words with Inkatha when Gauteng Police Commissioner Sharma Maharaj announced at a press conference that the ban would be enforced before and during the march.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government's concerted effort to undermine an Inkatha lobby determined to whip up resistance and confrontation over the ban -- an approach epitomised by IFP official Ed Tillet's fiery warnings about the consequences of enforcing it -- derives from evidence that national legislation was deliberately changed by FW de Klerk's government so that IFP members could arm themselves with spears and pangas at the height of political violence in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The carrying of dangerous weapons by Inkatha members, far from being a long-established tradition, was prohibited by law until De Klerk stepped in to ensure the Natal Code of Native Law was amended in 1990 -- a time when internecine strife was spiralling to levels higher than the country had ever experienced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Party government's action was clearly taken in close consultation with Inkatha, as the KwaZulu homeland followed by amending its own statutes in line with De Klerk's amendments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Evidence emerging from the Malan murder trial and the case against Vlakplaas police commander Eugene de Kock indicate that the traditional weapons measures coincided with far more serious programmes to arm paramilitary commandos inside Inkatha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Evidence collected by Zulu historians also shows that traditional leaders regularly enforced bans on the carrying of spears and other sharp weapons, especially at ceremonial and commemorative functions where women and children could get hurt by mishaps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Zulu men do have a tradition of carrying weapons but, when circumstances made it neccessary in the pre-conquest, independent Zulu kingdom, Zulu tradition and culture demanded that spears were not to be carried for fear of accidents,&quot; says Jeff Guy, an expert on Zulu history and author of the book The Destruction of the Zulu Kingdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Guy believes the current effort to mobilise support around the cultural weapons issue -- and to portray the new government's efforts to move back to a situation that had already existed before 1990 -- is part of a strategy to whip up &quot;provocation in the name of tradition&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While attention was focused on the march in Johannesburg, it was in KwaZulu-Natal that the most serious violence erupted. Anne Eveleth reports that police there confirmed four people were killed and six injured in six violent incidents in Durban's Umlazi township on Thursday morning. Residents, who struggled to get out of the township for work in the morning, said an attempt was under way to enforce a stayaway.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The government appears to be hastily back-pedaling on an extraordinary plan to build a gigantic monument -- at a cost of some R50- million -- modelled on President Nelson Mandela's hand as a &quot;beacon of freedom&quot; for South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The disembodied hand, standing 23 metres in height and &quot;breaking out of jail bars&quot;, would be the largest cast bronze sculpture in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even more startling than the concept are the men behind it. The commission to build the monument was given to Danie de Jager, responsible for such works as the Strijdom head in Pretoria and the statue of Hendrick Verwoerd which stands over the grave of the &quot;architect of apartheid&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The project leaders, appointed by President Mandela, are the multi-millionaire Krok brothers, Sol and Abe. The twins made their fortunes with cosmetics sold to the black population, including skin lighteners and products such as &quot;Dingaan's Blood Purifier&quot; and &quot;Skelm Worm Syrup&quot;. They were also convicted of illegal forex dealings in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela's office was insisting this week that the project was &quot;on hold&quot;.  The Kroks were also stressing that the scheme had only reached the stage of &quot;feasibility studies&quot;, as well as insisting that no government funds were involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the minutes of a meeting of an &quot;interim committee&quot;, held on September 10, records that Mandela had asked the Kroks &quot;to provide bridging finance&quot; and had &quot;indicated that the government was backing the project financially&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the sculptor, who has already sunk a small fortune into the project, says the models have already been completed and he expects the formal announcement to be made by the president soon, at a gala evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting of the interim committee responsible for the &quot;beacon of freedom&quot; was held at Summer Place, the fabulous Johannesburg home built by one of South Africa's most celebrated crooks, Marino Chiavelli, and now owned by the Kroks. The minutes record that the meeting was chaired by Sol Krok and attended by, among others, Ahmed Kathrada; Bart Dorrestein, chief executive of the construction company Stocks &amp; Stocks; Mandela's legal adviser, Professor Fink Haysom; and Professor Michael Katz, head of the Katz Commission on tax reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The minutes say that Sol Krok tabled a letter signed by President Mandela dated November 25 1994, appointing the twins as &quot;project leaders responsible for the execution of the project and fund-raising&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A second letter of the same date appointed De Jager &quot;as the official sculptor&quot; and authorised him to &quot;commence work on the project with immediate effect&quot;. The minutes later note that De Jager had already spent &quot;approximately R1,1-million on the project&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the minutes, the &quot;salient features&quot; of the &quot;Beacon of Freedom&quot; are the statue itself -- half the size of the Statue of Liberty, which is made of welded copper plates, rather than cast bronze; 40 plaques &quot;depicting the history of the Freedom Struggle of South Africa&quot;; an &quot;eternal flame housed in an amphitheatre&quot;; a statue of Mandela himself; a wall &quot;with the word freedom written on it in 100 different languages&quot;; a viewing balcony and a &quot;museum of apartheid&quot; covering 1 400 square metres. It is believed that the museum would constitute the second phase of the project and has been provisionally costed at another R50-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Models of the complex were shown to Mandela and Gauteng Premier Tokyo Sexwale separately in August and they respectively gave their &quot;approval&quot; and &quot;blessing&quot;, the minutes note.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The siting for the monument is not mentioned, but it was to be somewhere in Gauteng. De Jager wants it on a kopje. Pretoria's city fathers are believed to be keen to have it situated in their city, as part of the new Parliament which they hope to see transferred from Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The only qualification recorded in the minutes came from Haysom, who stressed the need for &quot;transparency&quot; and &quot;consensus&quot;. Haysom told the Mail &amp; Guardian this week that the project was &quot;on hold at the moment&quot; while they decided on an &quot;appropriate way of dealing with the national monument&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A representative of the Kroks said they were anxious that the project be &quot;transparent and consultative&quot;. She confirmed they had a model of the &quot;current concept&quot;, but refused to allow it to be seen on the grounds that it was &quot;not finalised&quot;, adding: &quot;Because we want to make the process transparent and consultative, we don't want to put the cart before the horse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The spokeswoman said &quot;there is no intention to use government funding; there has never been any intention to use government funding. It is a private-sector initiative initiated by the Krok brothers.&quot; She added that no funds had been raised, although pledges had been made &quot;loosely&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sculptor, De Jager, said that he had been scheduled to hold discussions with the president on Tuesday last week, but the meeting had been postponed when the Mandela divorce ran into a second day of hearings. &quot;We have made all the models for the project and we are waiting now for the president to do a press release,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - South Africa got its first black finance minister late on Thursday -- in the person of Trade and Industry Minister Trevor Manuel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a Cabinet reshuffle sparked by the resignation of Chris Liebenberg, Deputy Minister of Finance Alec Erwin will now take over Manuel's portfolio, while ANC MP Gill Marcus, chairman of Parliament's joint standing committee on finance, will become Deputy Finance Minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Nelson Mandela announced Liebenberg's long-anticipated resignation and the reshuffle at the conclusion of the first reading debate of the budget in the National Assembly on Thursday evening.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He consulted with his government of national unity partners, National Party leader FW de Klerk and IFP leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, during a meeting at Tuynhuis on Wednesday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liebenberg had already retired as chief executive of Nedcor when he was persuaded to take the position of finance minister in the wake of Derek Keys' sudden resignation in 1994. Liebenberg, who helped the ANC investigate its economic policy before it came into government, has made it clear in the past that he saw his task as a bridging role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is understood that he discussed his desire to resign with President Mandela some months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Manuel impressed many as a &quot;quick study&quot; when he took the helm of the Ministry of Trade and Industry and steered South Africa back into international trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His award in January 1994 from the World Economic Forum as &quot;Global Leader for Tommorrow&quot; recognised the former Western Cape political activist's impact on the world business arena -- a far cry from his previous record of one of the longest detained Cape activists during the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He introduced the South African political economy to the concepts of globalisation and international competitiveness. Despite grumblings from unions and business, his achievements have been remarkable, considering the economic self-sufficiency and isolation inherited from successive apartheid governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Manuel began his career as an engineer and practised as a technician in Cape Town before being catapulted into the hurly-burly of protest politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His first foray into politics began in the Cape Areas Housing Action League from which he was soon identified as leadership material for the United Democratic Front which he served as a national executive member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the security crackdown in the 1980s he spent 35 months in detention and under house arrest. His first experience in the economic arena was in 1989, when the was employed by the Mobil Foundation as policy manager on Entrepreneurial and Community Development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the unbanning of the ANC, he headed the organisation's Department of Economic Planning, shaping its economic policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Market reaction to the musical chairs was muted last night, although there were no immediate fears of dramatic policy changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dealers, while not overly enthusiastic at Manuel's appointment, felt he would have to continue the consultative line taken by his predecessor.  Certainly, no instant lifting of exchange controls was expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But once the news has been digested, the picture could be very different, especially if foreign investors take fright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Markets and business will adopt a wait-and-see approach; nobody was rushing in with great confidence. This attitude was reflected in late trading; the rand was uncharacteristically steady at R3,98.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - The Ethiopian Science and Technology Commission (ESTC) yesterday urged professionals engaged in gathering information, conducting researches and popularizing concepts related to the industrial sector to exert utmost efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opening a one-day workshop on industrial research and popularization management, ESTC Deputy Commissioner, Ato Asrat Bulbula, said researches on the industrial sector over the past three years were low when compared to similar undertakings in other fields, adding, however, that researchers who conduct studies on information gathering during the stated period lack experience.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Professionals engaged in agriculture, mines and water resources development were, however, successful in making better research popularization works, Ato Asrat told participants of the workshop organized by the ESTC and the Afro- Asian Technical Trading Company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the commission would do whatever is at its disposal to strengthen the current research and popularization works and assist young researchers both financially and materially.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About 75 senior professionals drawn from government and non-governmental organizations discussed concepts such as research popularization and research writing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The workshop is also expected to help in sharing experiences which could be instrumental to avoid possible hindrances likely to occur in generating sound research proposals.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tunis - Following a two-day summit organized to address humanitarian crises in the Great Lakes sub-region, the presidents of Zaire, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, and Tanzania issued the attached declaration stipulating further actions they plan to take to accelerate the repatriation of 1.7 million Rwandan refugees and curb violence in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The summit was the second organized by The Carter Center at the request of heads-of-state in the Great Lakes region of Africa. The first, held in Cairo Nov.28-29, 1995, resulted in an initial agreement, which was reviewed and further developed at the Tunis summit. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, former Tanzania President Julius Nyerere, and former Mali President, Amadou Toure facilitated the Tunis meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TUNIS DECLARATION ON THE GREAT LAKES REGION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> March 18, 1996</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Presidents Mobutu of Zaire, Museveni of Uganda, Bizimungu of Rwanda, Ntibantuganya of Burundi, and Mkapa of Tanzania met in Tunis, Tunisia from March 16-18, 1996 to carry forward their African initiative to promote peace, justice, reconciliation, stability, and development in the Great Lakes region. Former Presidents Carter of the United States, Nyerere of Tanzania, and Toure of Mali served as facilitators. The Heads of State reviewed the progress made toward the achievement of their commitments undertaken in Cairo, Egypt on Nov.29, 1995, decided on additional measures that must be taken to meet fully these commitments, and pledged themselves and their countries to undertake further actions to achieve their common goals for the region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Heads of State agreed that, while useful steps had been taken since Cairo, serious problems persist. These include intimidation in the refugee camps, concerns of some of the refugees about their security, cross-border raids into Rwanda and Burundi, inadequate judicial systems in Rwanda and Burundi, and continued violence in Burundi with little progress towards constructing a long term government structure that will ensure protection of the rights and interests of all groups, including minority groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Heads of State expressed their conviction that these problems can be addressed with the steps described below, which have been taken or will be taken. Together they will significantly reduce tension, hostility, insecurity, and distrust in the area, encourage the return of refugees, stimulate economic rehabilitation and development, and advance efforts to fashion long-term government structures acceptable to their citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also urged Rwanda and Burundi to enhance and strengthen further the process of confidence building through broad national consultative mechanisms to achieve long-term solutions and national reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On A Regional Level:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The Heads of State reaffirmed their rejection of the ideology of genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The Heads of State and their ministers have initiated a dynamic and sustained dialogue, involving frequent meetings with each other, to plan and undertake concerted endeavors in the region. This productive consultative relationship will continue at the Heads of State level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. The Heads of State expressed approval that, consistent with the Cairo Declaration, the Governments of Zaire and Rwanda had agreed in January on the return to Rwanda of heavy military equipment taken into Zaire by ex-Armed Forces of Rwanda, Zaire, on February 13, 1996, returned the military equipment which it had been able to identify and possess and agreed to continue its search efforts as promised to find the other equipment and to return it as found to the Rwandan government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Cross border incursions continue, and increasingly, the perpetrators kill civilians, particularly local officials, and lay land mines as they retreat. But some significant actions have been taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is now greater cooperation and information sharing among governments of the region. Tanzania has rounded up and confined 400 persons known to be involved in such activities. President Mkapa stressed that refugees in Tanzania received neither arms deliveries or military training.  Because of fighting in Burundi spilling across its border, Tanzania has increased its level of troops in the area as a deterrent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Additionally, the Heads of State pledge to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- take more rigorous efforts to shut down arms flow and military training to rebel groups engaged in cross-border incursions, including urging the UN to station monitors at airports and border points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Heads of State will restrict the travel of leaders associated with cross border incursions and urge other countries to take similar action and freeze the financial assets these persons hold abroad; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Heads of State will permit the Commission of Inquiry established by UN Resolution 1013 to investigate reports of military training and arms transfer to former Rwanda government forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. The Heads of State reiterated their hope that most of the refugees will return home in a relatively short period of time. They recognized, however, that many refugees would not likely repatriate in the near future because of their real or perceived association with the genocide in Rwanda.  In the camps themselves, intimidation is continuing. They also note that some bureaucratic procedures pertaining to logistics and registration are playing into the hands of intimidators and endanger refugees intending to repatriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- It should be noted that Zaire has arrested a few intimidators who have been removed from the refugee camps. In addition, Zaire has banned political activities of the RDR in camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Tanzania and Burundi have banned RDR political activity, and has tightened security control within the camps. Tanzania has identified the key intimidators within the camps and intends to separate then from the other refugees and house them in a camp in the interior. It is seeking financial assistance to carry through these plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- More needs to been done to separate the intimidators, including armed factions, from the other refugees in order to enable them to make a free choice about repatriation. Conscious of the need to avoid forced repatriation, the Heads of State challenge the international community to work with them and finance a major effort that would permit this choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This effort would consist of the following components:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- preparing the home communes to receive the refugees, including the placement in the communes of an adequate number of human rights and other monitors to ensure security;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- taking measures involving camp administration and management that will guard against cases of insecurity in the border areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. The Heads of State pledged full support to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and other jurisdictions in accordance with UN security resolution 955 (1994) of November 8, 1994. They promised to turn over to these jurisdictions indicted persons located in their countries and encouraged all other countries to do the same. President Mpaka said that the genocide suspects located in Tanzania are under surveillance and will be picked up if indicted by the Jurisdictions. The Heads of State further affirmed that they will cooperate fully in the investigations of the competent jurisdictions. They will similarly support the work of the International Commission of Inquiry for Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Heads of State of Rwanda and Burundi pledged to guarantee the security for personnel and witnesses relevant to the work of the International Tribunal and the Commission of Inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 7. The Heads of State expressed continuing concern about the use of radio broadcasts and print media to spread hate and fear in the region. The participants pledged to take action to curtail the illegal and inflammatory radio broadcasts from one country to another, and reaffirmed their requests for assistance. President Mpaka stressed that Tanzania would not permit hostile propaganda to be broadcast into neighboring countries. President Mobutu said he had asked for assistance to locate and halt inflammatory radio broadcast despite questions of sovereignty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Carter agreed to continue his discussions with experts to ascertain how and whether technical assistance can be provided to locate and prevent such broadcasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Within Rwanda:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 8. President Bizimungu expressed deep concern abuot the slow rate of refugee repatriation. Whereas 26,000 refugees from Burundia returned to Rwanda between December 1995 and February 1996, perceived insecurity within Burundi may have motivated some to repatriate. The refugee flows from Tanzania and Zaire during the same period amounted to 2000 and 20,000, respectively. President Bizimungu attributed these small flows to intimidation in the refugee camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 9. Consistent with the principle of justice with reconciliation and to demonstrate to the refugees its strong desire for them to return, the Government of Rwanda reaffirms its obligation to ensure the safety of returnees, protect their legal rights, and recover their property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To this end, the Rwandan Government has:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Announced a decision to establish special procedures to expedite legal proceedings for the large number of persons held on charges relating to genocide. These mechanisms, which include specialized chambers within ordinary courts, will enable the judicial system to carry out an expeditious and systematic categorization of genocide perpetrators; release those for whom adequate evidence is lacking; permit plea agreements when appropriate; and conduct early trials of those charged. It has trained personnel in arrest procedures and is appointing prosecutors to authorize all arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- In recognition that many refugees fear they will be arrested when they return, agreed to activate the review mechanism (Commission de Triage) to investigate cases (subject to judicial oversight) prior to arrests. It also accepts that defendants should have the opportunity to have the advice of legal counselors. It called upon the international community, particularly African states, to provide support for a mechanism to assist those who cannot afford legal counsel. The government of Rwanda expects its genocide trials to begin in May 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Trained 300 new magistrates, 90 new prosecutors, 250 new investigators, and has prepared files on thousands of individuals now ready for trial. The Government of Rwanda expressed appreciation to other countries who have provided technical and other assistance for this training and hopes that future assistance, particularly in the legal area, will be extended when requested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Attached special importance to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Rwanda and declared that it would welcome the strengthening of this office and the deployment of an expanded number of human rights monitors throughout the country. It is prepared to permit the number of such monitors to increase to an authorized level of 300, and called on the international community to provide the resources to finance the critical work of the human rights monitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Continue with programs to promote greater professionalism and discipline within the armed forces, Gendarmerie and the police force, including training in non-lethal riot control It plans to build more barracks for the soldiers and move forward in collaboration with the World Bank to establish a commission on demobilization and reintegration and initiate its work as soon as possible. The government promotes, within the framework of demobilization, integration into the military of those members of the ex-FAR who were not involved in the genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Pledged to encourage initiatives undertaken by indigenous NGOs to rebuild civil society; urged NGOs operating in camps to transfer progressively their services and personnel from countries of asylum to countries of origin; and emphasized the need for these organizations to focus more on rehabilitation and development and less on relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Pledged to work out quickly the modalities with international financial institutions and the donor community to permit the early allocation of existing and future pledges of assistance toward critical rehabilitation and development projects. At present only 40 percent of funds pledged have been disbursed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Reiterated its determination to strengthen administrative procedures that ensure respect of property rights, including land, as well as enable expeditious return of properties to their legitimate owners immediately on demand. In accordance with the Arusha agreement, new sites have been identified to develop for resettling old refugees, and the Government of Rwanda requested international technical and financial assistance in preparing these lands for settlement. The government will endeavor to provide special assistance for widows (including land owning rights), for orphans, and for communities that receive large numbers of returning refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Encouraged refugee repatriation by actively promoting &quot;look and see&quot; cross-border visits by refugees, sent senior government officials into camps in Tanzania and Burundi to explain conditions inside Rwanda and urged refugees to come home, plans to make similar visits to camps in Zaire, and is encouraging international organizations and NGOs to intensify the campaign to provide objective information to the refugee camps on events and developments inside Rwanda. President Mobutu and President Bizimungu agreed that a high level Rwandan team would visit refugee camps in Zaire very soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Collaborated closely with UNHCR and the countries of Tanzania, Zaire and Burundi in preparing for the refugee return and encouraging them to do so. Through this continuing collaboration, and with technical support and equipment, these governments and UNHCR should be able to ensure that processing and other re-entry requirements can be met with minimum delay to the returning refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Agreed to take concrete steps to encourage dialogue, social healing, and integration among all Rwandese, including those refugees who were not involved in the genocide and who seek to rebuild Rwanda. The Government of Rwanda requested the facilitators of the Great Lakes Summit to make contact with influential personalities among the refugees to encourage them to come home and to assist in promoting repatriation of other refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Demonstrating its commitment to transparency, agreed to make public a report on implementation of the recommendation of the Commission established to investigate the Kibeho incident, as well as the outcome of the Commission on Inquiry into the Kanama incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Within Burundi:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 10. The Head of State of Burundi and his delegation emphasized their commitment to bring to an end the climate of insecurity and impunity that has paralyzed the country. They will move with speed and determination to launch a process leading to new institutional structures agreed upon and supported by all citizens that will ensure protection of the rights of all Burundians, and their participation within the political and economic life if the nation.  To that end the Head of State and his delegation:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Welcomed that former Tanzanian President Mwalimu Julius K. Nyerere accepted the mandate given to him by the international community and endorsed by the Heads of State of the region, to assist the people of Burundi in finding means to achieve peace, stability and reconciliation within Burundi as a basis for a lasting political settlement. This settlement must include the resolution of fundamental problems relating to their access, control and management of power, so that either the ethnic or political minority is reassured. The Government of Burundi is committed to take concrete steps to fight exclusion, extermination and genocide which have been used by some to achieve and monopolize power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the success of any such dialogue, there should be an end to killings within Burundi. All parties, internal and external, should take all possible steps to create the necessary environment for successful progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Declared that the National Debate on the major problems facing the country will be launched urgently. The debate will seeks a consensus for constitutional structures as described above, which will promote peaceful coexistence among all Burundians. All parties and groups that seek these goals and renounce violence as a means to reach political ends could participate. These principles will be incorporated into the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Reported positively on the dialogue and growing collaboration among the government, different socio-political partners, and the security forces.  They reaffirmed their intention and determination to continue their collaboration. The representatives of the political parties, Frodebu and Uprona, who participated in the Tunis summit, made it clear that they appreciate and support the efforts of the government to restore peace and security to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Reaffirmed its commitment to repatriate the refugees and re integrate the displaced and dispersed elements of the population, premised on reconciliation at the community level. Adequate security will be essential.  International assistance will be required initially for communities heavily impacted by returnees, and to promote self-sufficiency of all returnees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Agreed to create the necessary conditions of security to facilitate the reintegration on campus and in hostels those students who have left them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Reiterated their commitment to guarantee the security of personnel and the UN, OAU, and humanitarian agencies in order that they can fulfill their mandate, particularly concerning affected populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Reaffirmed their commitment to continue to intensify their comprehensive dialogue aimed at ensuring the security of all and restoring mutual confidence among all Burundian citizens. This debate should lead to the establishment of a National Pact of Peaceful Coexistence between the different components of the country and of a constitution adapted to universal democratic principles and to the specifics of Burundi in order to put in place the indispensable instrument for the organization of free and fair elections in 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Declared their support for the deployment of UN Human Rights monitors based on the needs expressed by the government, stated strong hopes to see the current number substantially increased, and pledged to deploy these monitors to all sections of the country and ensure that they can safely carry out their functions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Reaffirmed their determination to guarantee security for personnel and witnesses reluctant to the work of the International Commission of Inquiry for Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- In order to begin the process by which the population will regain confidence in the security forces (as pledged in Cairo) committed to undertake a comprehensive training program to enhance professionalism and discipline within the security forces. Such training would include how to uphold international human rights conventions while carrying out military responsibilities. The Government of Burundi also intends to redefine the respective structures and mission of the security and defense forces so that they will assume responsibility for the security of all elements of the population. The international community should be prepared to provi de the necessary technical assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Once again called upon the international community in general and neighboring countries in particular to prevent armed external attacks on Burundi and to dismantle the networks of arms flow across borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Condemned the ideology of exclusion and genocide and expressed a strong desire for the expeditious establishment by the countries of the region of an early warning mechanism to prevent destabilization and human rights violations, as well as dissemination of the ideology of ethnic hatred, exclusion, and genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Agreed to develop a democratic policy, including provisions for independent and autonomous media; guarantee wider access to information to journalists on all sides; and support initiatives that promote responsibility of the media. As expressed in Cairo, they reaffirmed their deep concern over the use of radio broadcasts to spread hate and fear in the region. The participants pledged to take all possible action to terminate the illegal and inflammatory radio broadcasts from one country to another. They called upon the international community to assist by providing technology to identify and demobilize mobile transmitters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Pledged to guarantee neutrality and independence of the courts, and take concrete steps to improve the system of justice, including accelerating the trials of those accused of crimes against humanity; the training of lawyers, judges, and magistrates; and judicial assistance to defendants. They reiterated their request to the international community for assistance, including the use of foreign lawyers, to achieve these goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Pledged their commitment to organize democratic elections in 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Appeal to the International Community:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To enable the governments to fulfill the commitments made above, the Heads of State call upon the international community to assist in arranging and disbursing the necessary funding to achieve them. In Rwanda and Burundi, in addition to funding for rehabilitation, resettlement, and development, international assistance will be required for improving the systems of justice, development of democratic media policy, deployment of human rights monitors, and professionalization of the security forces. Member states of the UN are requested to respond generously to the appeals from UNHCR and UNHCHR. A greater proportion of funding should go to projects within the countries of origin. Funding must also be obtained in order to conduct the National Debate in Burundi, restore the environment in countries of asylum, and continue the work of the International Tribunal for Rwanda and the Commission of Inquiry for Burundi. Zaire and Tanzania require financial aid, and in some cases technical assistance for their efforts to separate intimidators from bonafide refugees. The facilitators agreed to work to obtain and expedite funding for these efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In recognition of the close collaboration between governments in the region and the international and regional governmental organizations and donor governments, as well as local and international NGOs, the Heads of State declared their willingness to work closely with these groups, and particularly with the UN, OAU, and World Bank, in the future. The focus of this collaboration should be the accomplishment of concrete programs and projects on the ground that will promote justice, reconciliation, peace, stability, and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Heads of State requested that former Presidents Carter, Nyerere, and Toure and Archbishop Tutu continue their efforts to facilitate contact and actions by their five governments, track comprehensively the achievements made at this meeting and in Cairo, and prepare recommendations for consideration by these governments at their next meeting. General Toure, who consulted extensively in the region since the Cairo Summit, suggested the following for future consideration: greater regional collaboration and economic and security matters; cooperation among African states in the areas of health, agriculture, and education; and a mechanism to accomplish these purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also accepted the invitation by CNN to arrange for participation in person or by satellite of the five Heads of State and the facilitators at the internationally broadcast CNN World Report in early May at which time they will be able to share worldwide their assessment of the situation in the Great Lakes region and the efforts being undertaken to deal with the complex, interrelated problems of the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Heads of State were pleased by the frank, open, and constructive discussions that characterized the Summit. They commended the Carter Center for arranging the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Heads of State and their delegations expressed their profound appreciation to President Ben Ali and the Tunisian people for their support and hospitality for this historic meeting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York - The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) today (March 18) launched its 1996 Nigeria campaign, &quot;Nigeria: The Press Under Siege.&quot; The campaign will mobilize CPJ membership and other international press freedom organizations, while working with Lagos-based journalists, to urge General Sani Abacha's military regime to cease its relentless assault on the country's independent press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Nigeria's press continues to be targeted by the government, and attacks on journalists and editorial offices have escalated in recent months,&quot; said Kakuna Kerina, CPJ's Program Coordinator for Africa. &quot;We are gravely concerned about our imprisoned colleagues' lives,&quot; she added, &quot;and we condemn the government's refusal to allow them the internationally mandated human right to medical care, legal representation and family visitation.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Abacha is using every weapon in his arsenal to intimidate journalists including: detention without charge; enforcement of military decrees before the secret Special Military Tribunal; assault, interrogation and torture at the hands of police and State Security (SSS) agents; editorial office bombings; and the banning and seizure of publications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The July 1995 conviction of &quot;The Sunday Magazine&quot; (&quot;TSM&quot;) editor in chief Christine Anyanwu, &quot;Weekend Classique&quot; editor Ben Charles Obi, &quot;Tell&quot; magazine assistant editor George Mbah and &quot;TheNEWS&quot; editor in chief Kunle Ajibade for coverage of, and alleged complicity in, a suspected coup plot, illuminated the lengths to which the current regime will go to restrict the press. The journalists continue to be held in deplorable conditions in a prison system where, during the past five years, 9,905 prisoners have died from communicable diseases alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1995 came to a close with a rash of bombings, seizures and the detention without charge, on December 23, of Nosa Igiebor, editor in chief of &quot;Tell&quot; magazine and a 1993 recipient of CPJ's International Press Freedom Award. In early 1996, General Abacha's unprecedented reign of terror against press freedom was expanded to include non-journalists: Prominent human rights attorneys Gani Fawehinmi and Femi Falana, who represent many members of the country's independent press, were detained without charge and are still being held in undisclosed locations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As reported in CPJ's annual report, &quot;Attacks on the Press in 1995,&quot; &quot;Nigeria's 136-year-old press still manages to produce 21 daily and 22 weekly newspapers, and 19 weekly news magazines, the majority of which are privately owned. Their struggle to publish and remain financially viable under the current siege is a testament to the professionalism and sheer ingenuity of journalists who manage to work while in hiding, publish with policestationed at printing presses and disseminate information to fellow citizens as police seize entire runs from the newsstands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CPJ applauds the World Press Review's recent choice of Dapo Olorunyomi, editor in chief of &quot;TheNEWS,&quot; a Lagos-based news magazine as co-winner of the magazine's 1995 International Editor of the Year Award. The award is given annually to editors working outside the United States, honoring &quot;enterprise, courage, and leadership in advancing the freedom and responsibility of the press, enhancing human rights, and fostering excellence in journalism.&quot; Olorunyomi shares the award with Fred M'membe, managing director and editor in chief of &quot;The Post,&quot; a Zambian daily newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We encourage all those interested in participating in CPJ's campaign to sign the attached letter to General Abacha, then mail or fax it to CPJ. CPJ will then forward the protest letters to the State House in Abuja, Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (For up-to-date information on the state of the press worldwide, and CPJ's activities and publications, visit CPJ's World Wide Web site at http://cpj.org. For more information, contact Kakuna Kerina, Program Coordinator for Africa, 330 Seventh Avenue, 12th Floor, New York, NY 10001 USA. Phone: (212)465-1004 x103. Fax: (212)465-9568. E-mail: kkerina@cpj.org.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ***************</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His Excellency General Sani Abacha Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces State House Abuja, NIGERIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Your Excellency,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I write to you to express my deepest concern for Nosa Igiebor, editor in chief of the Lagos-based &quot;Tell&quot; magazine, and to strongly protest his imprisonment since December 23, 1995--another strike against press freedom in the recent rash of attacks on the independent newsmagazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A recipient of the Committee to Protect Journalists' International Press Freedom Award in 1993, Igiebor was arrested by six members of the State Security Service (SSS) at his home in Lagos. Authorities continue to hold Igiebor in solitary confinement without charge. The harassment of &quot;Tell&quot; has been relentless; in December 1995, over 105,000 copies of &quot;Tell&quot; were seized by SSS agents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I also request that you grant the internationally recognized human right to medical care, legal representation and family visitation to the following imprisoned journalists who continue to be held in deplorable and life(&quot;The Sunday Magazine&quot;), George Mbah (&quot;Tell&quot;) and Ben Charles Obi threatening conditions: Kunle Ajibade (&quot;TheNEWS&quot;), Christine Anyanwu (&quot;Weekend Classique&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The persecution of the above-named editors, because of their work as journalists, unquestionably violates Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that states, &quot;Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas.&quot; Nigeria is a signatory to this declaration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, I respectfully call on Your Excellency to intervene on the side of press freedom, and to uphold your public proclamations of support for a free and independent press, by ensuring an environment in which journalists may work freely and safely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I welcome your comments and reply.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - It is not only difficult but also impossible to satisfy the demand of the peasantry for select seed unless and otherwise private investors and development organizations participate in seeds multiplication and distribution activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiotawi Democracy, organ of the EPRDF yesterday quoted the manager of the Ethiopian Seed Enterprise as saying the demand for select seeds has been increasing on a large scale because of the doubling of agricultural production after their application through the new extension programme.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ato Alemseged Aregay, department head within the enterprise said 4-5 million quintals of select seeds are required to satisfy the present demand of farmers but this figure cannot be met by the enterprise alone without the participation of investors and development organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ato Alemseged who said four of the five seed multiplication centres of the enterprise are located in the regions urged development associations in Oromiya, South Ethiopia and Amhara regional states to open new centres with a view to timely distributing select seeds and alleviating existing transportation problems.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, D.C. - After the Nigerian military regime hanged environmental and human rights leader Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other activists on Nov. 10, 1995, there was a wave of protest around the world. Hundreds of organizations spoke up to denounce the execution of Saro-Wiwa, a leader of the Ogoni people in the Niger delta. The international campaign in support of the democracy movement in Nigeria took on significant momentum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even before the executions, the United States and other governments criticized the Nigerian regime, cut off aid, restricted arms sales, and imposed visa restrictions on Nigerian officials. After the executions, the U.S. and other foreign ambassadors were withdrawn from Nigeria in protest, previous sanctions somewhat strengthened and stronger actions threatened.  President Nelson Mandela of South Africa, who had also invested his prestige in &quot;quiet diplomacy,&quot; led a successful move to suspend Nigeria from the Commonwealth and called for oil sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oil sanctions have been endorsed by a wide range of individuals and organizations, including Nobel Prize winners Wole Soyinka and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Human Rights Watch, Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, the AFL-CIO, TransAfrica, the Washington Office on Africa, and many other international and Nigerian groups. But governments have been reluctant to take stronger sanctions, particularly any affecting Nigeria's oil exports.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bills introduced in the U.S. Senate by Sen. Kassebaum (R-Kan.) and in the House by Rep. Payne (D-N.J.) fall short of comprehensive sanctions. But they do include new measures that go beyond the Administration's actions to date, including a ban on all new U.S. investment in Nigeria and a freeze on the personal assets of top officials of the Nigerian regime. After an extensive policy review, the Clinton administration in early March floated a trial balloon of similar measures. But reaction from European countries has been negative. And the quiet return of ambassadors to Nigeria, including the U.S. and South Africa, has given the impression of a trend to lessen rather than increase public pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile Congress is focused on domestic issues, and Nigeria has faded from the news. The momentum for stronger action from either the administration or Congress will continue to drop unless the Nigerian regime adds new well-publicized provocations or the pro-democracy movement succeeds in escalating protests. If the United States is to give more than lip-service support to Nigerians seeking democracy for their country, sustained public pressure is essential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Background to the Crisis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since independence in 1960, Nigeria has alternated between short periods of intense civilian political competition and longer stretches under military rule. Military governments ruled from 1966 to 1979, and from 1984 to the present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under British rule, Nigeria was divided administratively into three geographical areas: the north, predominantly Muslim and Hausa-speaking; the southeast, predominantly Christian and identified with the Igbo-speaking ethnic group; and the southwest, also predominantly Christian and largely Yoruba-speaking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Between 1967 and 1970, Nigeria fought a civil war over the secession of the eastern region, called Biafra. Despite intense ethnic polarization and perhaps as many as one million killed during the war, the winning federal government followed a policy of non-retribution. Subsequent division of Nigeria into smaller states produced larger representation for ethnic groups other than the big three.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While political competition often paralleled ethnic and regional divisions, there were also many cross-cutting divisions and alliances based on distinctions between civilian and military, rich and poor, and a host of other factors. A wide array of groups--private business, communications media, labor unions, professional associations, religious bodies, and a literary scene with world-renowned authors--built solid foundations for democratic culture and a vibrant civil society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Military Rejection of Democracy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1987 President Ibrahim Babangida, who came to power in a 1985 coup, officially began a program of transition to civilian rule. After many delays, it culminated in presidential elections in June 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The electoral system imposed two political parties created by the military: the National Republican Convention (NRC) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP). Both parties chose wealthy Muslim businessmen to run for president. The NRC candidate was Bashir Tofa, from northern Nigeria; Chief Moshood Abiola, from the southwest, was the candidate for the SDP. Although both had been approved by the military, Abiola, a flamboyant media magnate and philanthropist, was seen as potentially more independent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola won majorities in 22 of Nigeria's 31 states. Even in the north, he won 43% of the vote, including majorities in four of the 11 northern states. Northern feudal leaders and sections of the military feared loss of their power. President Babangida refused to allow official announcement of the vote count and annulled the results, alleging that the candidates had been buying votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Protests followed, in which the army killed more than 150 demonstrators, finally leading Babangida to resign. He installed his own civilian caretaker, Ernest Shonekan, who was in turn deposed by General Sani Abacha, a high-ranking member of the previous military regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new regime removed previously elected national and state legislatures and civilian state governments and banned all political activity. Since General Abacha took power in November 1993, human rights abuses by the regime have increased and have been met with escalating protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In June 1994, shortly before the first anniversary of the election, Chief Abiola proclaimed himself president. He was promptly arrested and put on trial for treason. Hundreds of other opposition figures and activists have also been arrested or harassed, and some have been mistreated in prison.  Although some have been released after periods of detention, most have not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The military has tried to portray the pro-democracy forces as simply ethnic compatriots and supporters of Abiola from the Yoruba-speaking southwest. But the campaign is in fact much wider, and includes Nigerians of all ethnic groups and religions. Almost all stress that their priority is support for the democratic process as such, not the political fortunes of one man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The campaign includes human rights groups which have long been active in demanding electoral democracy and respect for civil rights. Although Abiola is a Muslim, both Catholic and Protestant church groups have made statements calling for the results of the June 1993 elections to be honored. National organizations representing Nigeria's doctors, university teachers and staff, and students have actively pressed for the release of political prisoners and recognition of the election results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Campaign for Democracy, which spearheaded the demonstrations leading to Babangida's resignation, is the largest coalition of independent pro-democracy groups inside the country. A National Democratic Coalition, meanwhile, was formed in May 1994 by political figures opposed to the regime, including many elected officials dismissed from their posts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1994, Nigeria's oil worker unions went out on strike, including among their demands a hand-over of government to the civilian winner of the June 1993 election. Oil accounts for over 80% of Nigeria's export earnings, and the strike was extremely effective for two months. The military eventually broke the strike, arresting key officials and suspending the leadership of the two oil unions and the Nigerian Labor Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Intensified Repression</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In October 1995, General Abacha announced a new three-year program of transition to civilian rule and commuted death sentences for some 40 opponents of the government in prison for allegedly planning a coup. The regime sought to portray its opponents as unpatriotic and their international supporters as mounting a campaign against Nigeria as a country. And it continued the well-worn strategy of buying out some opposition figures while harassing or forcing others into exile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Legal maneuvers or international pressure sometimes forced the regime to reverse its steps. But newspapers with bans lifted after promises of self-censorship still had to fear arson, confiscation of published papers, and attacks on journalists. Human rights activists who managed to get out on bail could expect to be redetained at any moment. And even world-famous figures such as Nobel Prize-winning writer Wole Soyinka were forced to flee into exile. Former head of state General Olusegun Obasanjo, who handed over power peacefully to civilian rule in 1979 and subsequently made an international reputation as a statesman, was arrested in March 1995. He remains in prison along with others sentenced by a military tribunal for alleged involvement in a coup attempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In November, finally, came the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his colleagues. The hangings capped years of protest by Saro-Wiwa's movement against environmental degradation of Ogoni land by multinational oil companies, particularly Shell Oil. According to Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and other human rights organizations, the military tribunal which tried Saro-Wiwa on charges of instigating the murder of four Ogoni leaders was marked by torture of witnesses and other abuses. The nine activists were executed despite appeals for clemency from many world leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since then, the regime, apparently impervious to the wave of international criticism, has continued on its course. It has consistently rejected demands to release political prisoners, and in February this year refused to consider a proposal by the National Democratic Coalition for an alternative one-year transition to civilian rule. The Coalition's plan includes release of presidential election winner Abiola, the creation of a transitional government of national unity, and the calling of a sovereign national conference to draft a new constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Local elections the regime claims are a first step to democracy were held last week. They have been dismissed by pro-democracy advocates, given the failure to release political prisoners and the fact that those elected may be dismissed at will by the head of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The International Response</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the options for protest inside Nigeria being steadily narrowed, much of the dynamic of the pro-democracy struggle has moved to the international arena. As with the anti-apartheid movement in the 1960s and 1970s, this international movement is built on the efforts both of exiles and of a wide range of non-Nigerian friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dozens of small groups operate among the large Nigerian expatriate population in the United States and elsewhere. Key common demands are that political prisoners be freed and that the military step down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Internationally, the pro-democracy movement has drawn in environmentalists, human rights activists, trade unionists, church groups, students and many others, in addition to Africa advocacy groups. Vested interests and inertia, however, mean that the obstacles to bringing significant pressure on the regime are still very large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only days after the executions, Shell Oil and other companies decided to proceed with plans for a $3.8 billion investment in a new natural gas facility. Oil provides over 90% of Nigeria's export earnings, and the regime's survival depends on these earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States is the largest customer for Nigeria's oil, consuming more than 40% of the country's output. However, oil from Nigeria accounts for only 8% of U.S. oil imports, and 3.5% of total U.S. oil consumption. &quot;It is both economically possible and morally imperative that we stop the consumption of the oil that fuels the current regime,&quot; noted a December 1995 statement endorsed by almost 100 U.S.-based church, human rights, labor, environmental and pro-democracy groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The current bills before Congress are limited steps. But they would impose real penalties on the regime, and would build momentum for stronger action if the military still refuses to budge. The Senate legislation also specifically urges the Administration to seek support for international embargoes on oil imports and arms sales to Nigeria.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - It was considered taboo for the early Catholic missionaries in Africa to express theological sympathy for African cultural values in evangelisation. But today, the leadership of the Catholic Church in Africa and at the Vatican are emphasizing links between scripture and African values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In their historic special assembly, held in Rome in 1994, African Catholic Bishops said of inculturation; &quot;The synod considers inculturation an urgent priority in the life of the particular churches, for a firm rooting of the Gospel in Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whereas the Catholic Church in Africa has not instituted a well defined approach to realise the goal of Gospel inculturation, Pope John Paul II has already launched the Post Synodal Exhortation, Ecclesia in Africa, which highlights the synod for the African Catholic bishops.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On March 14, Rev. Dr. Aylward Shorter, of the Missionaries of Africa Order, launched a book, &quot;Christianity and the African Imagination,&quot; which is an attempt to carry out a dialogue with African oral tradition and use this as a resource for the incuturation of the Gospel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Through the 128-page volume, the author highlights the impact of African cultural values in the teaching of the Gospel message in Africa, the misplacement of African values in the teaching of the Gospel by the early Church, some efforts in promoting African cultural values by some missionaries and the current position of the Vatican in the incorporation of African values in the Catholic teachings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The author, who has spent 30 of his missionary service in Africa and has visited half of the countries on the continent, explores his subject under six well selected topics. They include Religion and Imagination in Contemporary Africa; Mission, Language and Culture, (the case of Charles Lavigerie); The Function and Future of African Christian Art; Christian Themes in African Creative Writing; Christianity and Oral Tradition; and The African Synod: Dialogue with the African Imagination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African culture should not be defined eurocentrically, in terms of what European culture is not, cations the author, while addressing himself to the subject of culture, imagination and faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He advances that &quot;it would be a dangerous over-simplification to characterise European culture as rational and African culture as symbolic.&quot; Dr. Shorter argues that African thought forms are far from being impervious to rational analysis and symbolism is far from unknown in Europe and America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Fr. Shorter, Africans have a legitimate desire to reformulate the truths of faith in accordance with their own cultural forms of expression. &quot;They need not and should not replicate the intellectual history of Europe in order to understand what the Gospels say about Jesus.  Ultimately, an existential - not a pseudo- objective interpretation of scripture is necessary,&quot; he recommends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The author laments that the Rwandan holocaust underlines the ambiguity of the contemporary cultural situation in Africa. He says that sophisticated ideas of multi-party democracy from the West have followed upon a history of Western colonial and neo-colonial manipulation. These, he adds, have fostered ethnic antagonism and ultimately ethnic violence on a massive scale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Christian faith, also brought by Westerners, has flourished in Rwanda on an extensive scale, says Dr. Shorter. He adds; &quot;This faith, however, was sufficiently rooted in the hearts and minds of Rwandans for some heroic Christians to resist the violence and to give their lives for their brothers and sisters of the other ethnic group.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the church's recognition and cultural pluralism, the author says of the Catholic Church of the past; &quot;For centuries, the Catholic Church espoused a philosophy of eurocentric monoculturalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is what Bernard Lonergan has called classicist assumption that there was single, universal, normative criterion, usually called civilisation, according to which the cultivation or barbarism of human individuals could be assessed,&quot; laments Dr. Shorter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the author cites two outstanding foreign missionaries to Africa, whose pastoral work went hand in hand with their commitment towards promoting African values. He cites Cardinal Lavigerie, the founder of the Missionaries Society of Africa Catholic Order and Bishop Daniel Comboni, whose early missionary work in Central Africa made a remarkable contribution to the evangelisation of the Gospel among the local people in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He quotes a letter the Cardinal wrote to the missionaries of the first caravan to Equatorial Africa in 1878; &quot;I desire that as soon as such a thing is possible, and not later than six months after your arrival in the mission, all missionaries shall speak with each other only in the language of the people among whom they live.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his concluding chapter, The African Synod: Dialogue with the African Imagination, Dr. Shorter says of the African imagination -- the African imagination is not merely religious; it also has a strong and specific affinity with Christianity. He further argues that the African religious imagination is the substratum that underlies all the Christian denominations and indeed, all the immigrant religions in Africa. This fact should facilitate Christian and interreligious dialogue, he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The author further cites the development of Black theology in South Africa as a case in point to prove that Christianity was not absent from the African imagination. &quot;Indeed, Black Theology developed as a creative religious response to the Black Theology consciousness movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Steve Biko saw this as the most positive facet of the interaction of the movement with Christianity,&quot; writes Dr. Shorter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Dr. Shorter admits that the mission of inculturating the Christian message in Africa is not smooth sailing. The author talks of fears and difficulties ahead for the Catholic Church in Africa as it endeavours to inculturate the Gospel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He says; &quot;Some theologians of liberation have seen inculturation as running the risk of becoming an antiquarian irrelevance, a form of indigenism or else of being open to idealist misunderstanding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Dr. Shorter, the inculturation praxis has an important role to play in the liberation of Africa and in bringing into existence a new humanity and a new society in the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The liberation and inculturation agenda are therefore closer than originally thought, argues Dr. Shorter. &quot;In culturally disoriented situations like that of Rwanda, as indeed in other situations in Africa and outside, inculturation and liberation is an on-going process,&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is not a fact which is either accomplished or not accomplished..It is, moreover, a process that is informed by the African religious imagination, challenged by the gospel brought to Africa via an historical, intercultural, missionary movement.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Widely used and cheap, health officials say that, to a large extent, chloroquine &quot;is no longer effective.&quot;: Children are most in danger because their natural immune response is still under-developed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the intense publicity given to diseases like the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), malaria remains a major killer in many African countries.  Reports of several hundred deaths that<BR>occurred in Swaziland in a malaria epidemic early this month bear witness to the seriousness of this disease.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Kenya, doctors are also recommending that first-time pregnant women and travellers into endemic malaria areas who become infected be treated with medicines other than chloroquine, to which the malaria causing parasite - plasmodium falciparum - has developed considerable resistance. The parasite is transmitted by certain mosquitoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senior officials of the Ministry of Health Malaria Project confirmed to APS that the recommendation for the phasing out of chloroquine in the treatment of specific groups &quot;will soon be implemented.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Beth Rapuodo, Manager of the Malaria Control Unit of the Ministry of Health emphasised that while &quot;deeply regrettable,&quot; the phase out of chloroquine was inevitable. Asserted Dr. Rapuodo: &quot;Chloroquine will be badly missed by the medical profession and the wider public. It is easily the best drug in decades. It is cheap, has minimum side effects and was widely available. Frankly, we will be sorry to see chloroquine go but it has been overtaken by events.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Christopher Nevill, a malaria specialist with the African Medical Research Foundation (AMREF), and member of the Ministry of Health technical committee on drugs, equally noted the inevitability that chloroquine would eventually give way to other drugs. &quot;It is parasite dynamics - we are looking at an old parasite that has changed to cope with what we have been throwing at it. Certainly, it is not a brand new parasite, but one that has been evolving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Nevill emphasized that the most important group as far as malaria is concerned are children. In Africa, children comprise 75 per cent of mortality victims attributed to malaria - more than 1.5 million deaths per annum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All over Kenya, more than 70 per cent of the children treated with chloroquine still have a parasite load after one week. &quot;We cannot continue with a drug like that, it is dangerous,&quot; says Dr. Nevill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First time pregnant mothers too are susceptible to malaria because changes in a woman's body during the first pregnancy depress her immunity, thus affecting the ability to fend off diseases like malaria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ministry of Health recommends that two drugs currently in use replace chloroquine. These are Comaquin (Amodiaquin) and Fansidar (Pyrimethamine Sulfadioxine). Dr. Nevill emphasized that these drugs should not be used for prophylaxis - that is, prevention of malaria. &quot;The World Health Organisation (WHO), has recommended that these drugs should not be used in the routine prevention of malaria, otherwise this will encourage faster development of resistant strains.&quot; Furthermore if used for prevention on a weekly basis, there is greater danger of severe side effects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked about the cost, Dr. Nevill conceded that this would &quot;more than double.&quot; However, a reduction in child mortality and the number of people with severe diseases taking up hospital beds will compensate for the rise in costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another critical factor contributing to recurrent high costs in treating malaria, is the absence of low cost laboratory services at rural dispensaries throughout Eastern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The work of Dr. Carter of AMREF has shown that it should not cost more than Kshs.10 to Kshs.20 (about US 20 to 40 cents) to test for malaria.&quot; Dr.  Nevill further said the AMREF study has shown that with properly equipped, funded and motivated workers, rural dispensaries in Eastern Africa can provide crucial services in the fight against malaria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Low cost laboratory services are important because, without a bloodslide you can never be sure whether a patient has malaria or any number of other diseases that mimic the symptoms associated with malaria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are myriads of diseases both viral and bacterial - that, at first sight, may be confused for malaria. &quot;You must have a blood test,&quot; emphasized Dr. Nevill. He gave an example of Kilifi District, a moderately high malaria zone on the Kenyan coast. He noted that outside the rainy season in the area, only 40 out of every 100 children who turn up with fevers and other malaria symptoms are actually diagnosed with malaria. The figure rises steeply for Kisumu in the west, a high malaria zone on the shores of Lake Victoria. At least 70 per cent of the children in this lake region will be found to have malaria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By contrast, in Nairobi, a low malaria zone, less than one per cent of the children will be found to have malaria. Dr. Nevill noted that the figures rise dramatically in each area during the rainy season when malaria incidence peaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Rapuodo told APS that the WHO allowed each country to make independent decisions on problems like drug resistance. However, because there are many difficulties of logistics associated with phasing out a widely used drug like chloroquine, the Ministry of Health intends to undertake the process in stages, starting with a pilot project that would gather data on factors like side effects, distribution and other constraints that would be associated with Fansidar/Comoquin becoming first line treatment drugs for children with malaria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Nevill who pioneered the use of impregnated mosquito nets in Kenya 10 years ago, urges more people to use the nets for prevention. These devices have a small amount of insecticide coated on the fabric and are able to repel malaria mosquitoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He pointed out that in some malaria endemic areas of Kenya, people receive between 100 to 300 infected mosquito bites per annum, which explains the high mortality rates due to malaria in those areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He promised that a WHO funded project in Kilifi District of Kenya, will reveal &quot;exciting data&quot; on the effectiveness of impregnated nets in malaria prevention. The results will be published in May this year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Millions of people all over the world fall victim to cancer, a terminal disease with no known cure. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that there are 25,000 new cases of cancer every year worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although no national statistics exist at the Kenya Cancer Association's registry, the traumatic experience undergone by cancer patients who have to live in constant pain and fear of looming death is not alien to many Kenyan families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many patients will tell tales of being isolated by their illness, of pain which cannot be adequately controlled, eventually rendering them invalids and dependent upon their families, for whom they have been providing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Jane Nzioka, a 56-year-old widower from Machakos, in Eastern Province, the pain, loneliness and loss of livelihood as a result of being afflicted by cancer of the maxilla or cheekbone three years ago, has been lessened by emotional, spiritual and social support. Her childhood ability to weave ciondos (bags made from sisal) has not only been preserved but also enhanced to become a source of income for the family, thanks to the Nairobi Hospice, the only centre for the terminally ill in Kenya and until recently the only one in East Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Located on a plot next to the imposing Kenyatta National Hospital, some three kilometres from the city centre, the Nairobi Hospice offers palliative medical and nursing care and psychological counselling by people especially trained in the needs of the terminally ill and their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nairobi Hospice celebrated its sixth anniversary on February 27, 1996. However, when this writer visited the centre to interview the Medical Officer, Dr. Michael Hughes, neither he nor any of the staff or patients were in a festive mood. The busy schedule of caring for cancer patients in the hospice and outside is an arduous task for the staff who stress on the quality of life lived for the day as stated in their motto: &quot;Put life in their days, not just days into their life.&quot; Dr. Hughes who joined the centre in 1993 says the Nairobi Hospice is not fighting for a cure for cancer but concentrates on the comfort and &quot;quality of life, not just the quantity or length of life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From a staff of one nurse and a secretary in February 1990, the Hospice today has a staff of more than 14 full-time workers including five nurses, two doctors and a social worker, not to mention the growing number of volunteers offering various services. &quot;During this period, we have looked after more than 1500 patients, and on average have 180 patients under our care at any one time, including 120 from up-country,&quot; Dr. Hughes told this writer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the late Prof. Edward Kasili began the hospice together with two nurses, Ruth Wooldridge and Jane Moore in 1990, little did the cancer researcher know that he himself would also benefit from the centre's services. Several years later, he was diagnosed with cancer of the liver and was cared for by the Hospice staff until the day he passed away. Before his death, the pioneer researcher whose life was dedicated to finding out the causes of certain cancers in Africa in the hope of finding a cure, also established the Nairobi Terminal Care Centre, the fore-runner to the Nairobi Hospice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We look after patients and the families of patients who have a cancer that cannot be completely cured. We help the patient to cope with the disease by giving him or her feedback and counselling on the nature of the sickness.  Therefore we treat patients with an attitude of counselling by looking after the patient and also counselling the whole family to remove fear and inadequacy so that our patients can die in dignity,&quot; Dr. Hughes explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The difference between a hospice and a hospital, is that in the former, &quot;palliative&quot; or &quot;terminal&quot; care are the operative words. This means that appropriate medical and nursing care to relieve pain, which 70 per cent of cancer patients suffer from are provided alongside psychological counselling and recreation on an out-patient and home-visitation basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Hughes describes cancer as a large group of diseases characterised by uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. Normal cells grow for a purpose to replace worn out tissues or repair injuries but cancer cells grow for no reason and destroy normal cells in the process. &quot;The causes of cancer are still unclear,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Minus statistics, the Nairobi Hospice Medical Officer says, &quot;60 per cent of our patients are women suffering from cancer of the cervix and breast while the remainder are men and children afflicted with bowel, stomach and leukemia cancers. The average age of our patients is 46 years and 50 per cent of our patients come from up-country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He notes that of late, some skin cancers and cancers affecting the blood have been reported and that these are common with HIV patients. He says cancer is also caused by certain habits which may trigger changes in the cell function. &quot;Cigarette smoking can cause lung, mouth or oesophagus cancer while excessive alcohol intake can lead to cancer of the throat, liver and stomach,&quot; adds the Nairobi Hospice Medical Officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Hughes points out that although not inherited, some cancers are common within certain families such as cancer of the breast or stomach.  &quot;Therefore, close relatives of patients with these cancers may need more frequent cancer related check-ups, though the risk is still very small.  Cancer is neither infectious nor contagious,&quot; he says. He adds that some of the more than 100 types of cancer affecting the body can be cured, including breast, cervical and leukemia, but the majority of the patients seek treatment at a very late stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nairobi Hospice chief executive and project coordinator Brigid Sirengo says, &quot;the Hospice approach is to give a family and community involvement in caring for the patients unlike an in-patient facility which can be taken as a dumping ground for patients.&quot; The Hospice hopes that palliative care can be introduced in training to help nurses cope with the psychological and physical pain of the patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the ailing, Dr. Hughes says, chemotherapy treatment is given.  &quot;Chemotherapy is derived from two words: chemical and therapy, but in a layman's language, it means the use of anti-cancer drugs to destroy cancer cells.&quot; Another treatment is the use of powerful X-rays to destroy the cancer cells or injections to administer doses of morphine to ease pain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nairobi Hospice also runs a day care centre every Thursday.  Introduced in December 1993, it serves as an informal session, bringing together patients, doctors, nurses, social workers and volunteers. When this writer visited the centre early March, several patients were cheerfully seated enjoying a cup of tea. Upon introduction to Jane Nzioka, she told this writer; &quot;I look forward to this day because it helps me to see other patients who are my best friends, especially Nelly (the day care coordinator) and it gives me an opportunity to use my hands which are still fit to make ciondos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nelly Oyamo, the head nurse at the Hospice, has been involved in its work for four years now and is in charge of the Day Care activities. &quot;We provide games like scrabble, cards and even rounders out in the field. Some women like knitting while other patients prefer to watch television or videos. Some prefer to just keep quiet and we let them do so. We also provide physiotherapy exercises for them,&quot; she told this writer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least once a month, the patients are taken out to cultural centres such as the National Museum and other tourist sites like Lake Nakuru in the Rift Valley. The day care service benefits 12 regular patients, some of whom have to walk quite some distance to share in the six-hour session from 9a.m to 3p.m. &quot;The attendance could be more if transport was available from well-wishers, especially for our patients in the outskirts of Nairobi,&quot; says Nelly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nairobi Hospice is run with the help of volunteers like those on the day care centre as well as well-wishers from all walks of life. They undergo a training course, thus qualifying to assist in visiting patients at home, fundraising and other administrative duties. Currently, the centre has 68 such workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is in the same spirit that the Nyeri Hospice, in Central Province, about 200 kilometres north of Nairobi opened its doors to the public last December. Kathy Sembi, Mary Kihara and Florence Kiama who are the project coordinator, nurse and secretary respectively, rent a vehicle to conduct home visits that take care of upto 13 families so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is a vital service to rural cancer patients who mainly have to travel all the way to Nairobi for drugs or palliative care. The Nyeri Hospice which is part of the Nairobi Hospice plans to branch out to other towns in the near future, says Dr. Hughes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is this ability to take on the odds and prevail that marks out the Nairobi Hospice as a unique treatment centre. The Chief Executive Brigid Sirengo sums up its services thus; &quot;Cancer patients do not need advanced technology or such complications, they need you and me to show that we care and this quality can be found even in developing countries which may not have much technology.&quot; It is in this light that others can take up the challenge to support the Hospice, but better till, begin one that will cater for other terminal illnesses, top on the list being the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE - African churches should lobby their governments for the ratification of the African Charter on the rights and welfare of the child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Delegates to a church-sponsored consultation on the African child, held here from March 10 to 17, were surprised to hear that only a few African countries had so far signed and ratified the charter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It was out of this shocking information that the delegates, who included social workers, parliamentarians, scholars, church ministers and scores of children, called for the lobbying and advocacy for the ratification of the charter,&quot; said Rev. Dr. Setri Nyomi who attended the meeting.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ghanaian church minister, who represented the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC), told APS that delegates to the consultation agreed that the signing and ratification of this charter by African governments, was crucial to solving problems facing the African child today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The week long consultation was sponsored by the Association of Evangelicals in Africa (AEA) in partnership with the World Vision International, Compasion International and the AACC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting which deliberated on the theme-Generation at Risk: What Future, highlighted among other issues, children of war, education, child growth and development and political effects on the child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The consultation also called on churches in Africa to provide pastoral services for children and encourage every Christian to be a child evangelist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The delegates recommended that churches should work hand in hand with organisations already engaged in child social work at local, national and continental levels with the aim to strengthen effectiveness in ensuring child survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The church at various levels should create and strengthen fora for discussion of social issues related to children, the meeting further recommended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Participants also called on churches to train lay counsellors and provide counselling and guidance for children and youth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Churches and para-church organisations should directly monitor child abuse, neglect and exploitation in communities and also provide help (including counselling) for victims, they recommended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting also urged African governments to commit greater resources to programmes for alleviation of poverty in both rural and urban areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the Nairobi-based African Network for the Prevention and Protection Against Child Abuse and Neglect (ANPPCAN), by 1995, only six African countries had so far ratified the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) Charter on the rights and welfare of the child, since its adoption by member states in 1979.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These countries include Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Mauritius, Sierra Leone, Uganda and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A total of 15 countries are supposed to sign and ratify the charter before it becomes operational.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kigali - The United States Department of Defence is donating to Rwanda 20 dogs which have been trained to sniff landmines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dogs will be involved in a de-mining programme which is being implemented by a private company called RONCO. The company has previously carried out demining work in Mozambique.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Rwanda, landmines and the smaller anti-personnel mines were liberally planted by members of the defeated army and militias associated with the regime of the late President Juvenal Habyarimana, both during the civil war in the early 90s and later as the war intensified in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Hutu army and militias, feeling more and more insecure planted so many mines that the country is considered one vast minefield. Rwanda has more than 300 amputees as a result. Many others have died from mine related incidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least a dozen out of the 20 dogs are already in the country. They are aged between 16 and 24 months and are said to have a lifespan of at least eight years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Department of Defence in Washington has given these dogs at least six to 10 weeks of training. The dogs will receive a further eight weeks of training while in Rwanda jointly with their handlers who are members of the Rwanda Defence Force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Case Stek, a senior official of the United States Embassy in Kigali, Rwanda, told APS that &quot;it takes special dogs to do this high specialised work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He noted that just as it requires special dogs to guide blind people, it also takes special dogs to locate landmines. &quot;These dogs are particularly suitable for the hilly countryside that is characteristic of Rwanda. They will work where other equipments like bulldozers may be entirely unsuitable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Once a dog detects a suspected landmine, electronic devices may then be used to verify that it is indeed a landmine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other sources say these dogs originate from Belgium. The US Department of Defence acquired the dogs from the breeder for about US dollars 1500 each.  The entire cost of training these dogs is put at about US dollars 8,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The input of the US government into the entire demining programme in Rwanda is expected to cost US dollars 3 million. This includes vehicles, bulldozers, specialised clothing and other equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the Managing Director of Zimbabwe Defence Industries (ZDI) Colonel Dube, has denied recent news reports in Europe which claimed that Zimbabwe was a major producer of landmines in Eastern and Southern Africa.  The ZDI is a subsidiary of the Ministry of Defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Colonel Dube emphasised that &quot;no landmines are made by the ZDI. We have invited the Red Cross and the United Nations (UN) to verify the fact,&quot; he said in a recent radio interview.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Freetown - Ahmad Tejan Kabbah was declared Sierra Leone's new president on March 17 after winning a presidential election run-off in this west African nation, electoral commission chairman James Jonah announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kabbah, who heads the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP), won 608,419 votes, 59.49 per cent of those cast, in a run-off poll held on March 15, against the 414,335, or 40.51 per cent, won by his sole rival, John Karefa Smart of the United National People's Party (UNPP), Jonah said in a statement broadcast on national radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turnout in the run-off was more than 81 per cent, according to the figures released by the commission chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The poll, the country's first real opportunity for 30 years to elect a chief executive, is due to clinch the transition from military to civilian rule.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The run-off followed an inconclusive first round -- held late February together with legislative polls -- where Kabbah won 35.8 per cent of the vote against Karefa-Smart's 22.6 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Election regulations stipulated a run-off would be held if no candidate won at least 55 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although both the SLPP and the UNPP had said they were confident of victory before the announcement of the results, most observers had predicted a win for Kabbah not only because of his first round lead, but also because he had managed to garner the support of several other parties before the second round was held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SLPP, the oldest political party in the country, also led the legislative poll, held under a proportional representation system with 36.1 per cent of the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Revolutionary United Front (RUF) is a rebel group that plunged Sierra Leone into civil war five years ago. Since then at least 10,000 people have died and almost half the west African country's 4.5 million inhabitants have been forced to flee their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conflict has devastated the country, now one of the poorest in the world despite an abundance of valuable natural resources, and there can be little hope of development promised by politicians across the board, until the fighting stops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The RUF does not recognise these elections -- and hence neither the president nor government they produce -- saying peace should be brought to the country first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was a view shared by the military junta, in power since a 1992 coup, which failed to persuade a conference of prominent civilians to postpone the election process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fearing a continuation of military rule with which most of the country is fed up, these civilians decided to uphold the election date they had set last summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soon after the announcement, thousands of Sierra Leoneans danced in the streets of the capital Freetown until the early hours on March 18 to celebrate the return of democracy heralded by the election of the new president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spontaneous processions formed in the winding streets of Freetown soon after the result was announced, bringing traffic first to a standstill, then to a horn-honking participation in the general euphoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many marchers carried palm fronds, the SLPP's emblem, and sang songs of victory in Krio, Mende, and Limba, three of the country's languages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The general prayer of every Sierra Leonean was, 'give us a leader who has sympathy for the masses',&quot; explained Mohammed, a 25-year-old driver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The army was notable by its absence from election's result festivities, perhaps aware that the capital was celebrating not so much the victory of Kabbah, as the demise of a military regime that has ruled by decree since it took power in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new developments got a shot in the arm when military ruler Brigadier-General Julius Maada Bio announced that the junta would hand over power to the democratically-elected government on March 29 when the new president would be sworn in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maada Bio also announced that a summit between himself and RUF leader Foday Sankoh would be held on March 25 in Ivory Coast's economic capital, Abidjan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Soon, we will all witness the dawn of a new era in our country's history when on March 29, 1996 the new President will be sworn in to assume office,&quot; Maada Bio said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The RUF, who claim to be &quot;fighting for democracy,&quot; have called a two- month ceasefire and in a turnabout, also said that they were willing to talk to Kabbah, although they maintain that they do not recognise him as president and the legitimacy of the process that elected him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Durban - Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini is under increased police protection following intelligence reports that hardline right wing elements in South Africa could kill the king and plunge the Zulu nation into civil war, according to a Radio Vatican report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African Police Commissioner George Fivaz reinforced police protection for King Zwelithini at his palace near Nangoma in Kwa- Zulu-Natal, the traditional homeland of some 8 million Zulus, according to other reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On March 15, the Zulu King hosted peace talks that were called by South African President Nelson Mandela, with the aim of defusing the long running feud between supporters of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) under Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi who is the arch-rival and antagonist of King Zwelithini.  The King and his supporters back Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) party.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rivalry among the factions within the Zulu nation has cost the lives of some 20,000 people in the last 10 years. These include an estimated 250 policemen killed in the last 18 months alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> News reports of President Mandela's peacemaking efforts in Kwa-Zulu- Natal emphasised the negative aspects such as the jeering and the discordance that Mandela faced when he addressed nearly 2,000 traditional rulers gathered in one of the King's houses near Nangoma Palace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said President Mandela's important message to the protagonists in the trouble torn region was simply; &quot;You don't have to kill to put your point across.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political analysts in South Africa say by going to Kwa-Zulu-Natal in a fighting mood, Mandela has shown that he can take a difficult bull by the horns. Many people in Kwa-Zulu-Natal thought Mandela had neglected their conflicts which continue to claim 100 lives every month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela himself said optimistically, &quot;people are beginning to think.&quot; The President sees light at the end of the tunnel as far as resolving the violence in Natal is concerned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cairo - Egyptian Interior Minister Hassan al-Alfi announced on March 17 the lifting of a 17-month curfew imposed on the southern town of Mallawi, one of the centres of Muslim militant violence in the country for the past three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The curfew is permanently lifted in Mallawi town starting March 17, as the people of Mallawi have affirmed that they will stand with police against terrorism, and will be lifted in stages in 12 nearby villages,&quot; Alfi told journalists during a tour of the town, 300 kilometres south of Cairo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The curfew was slapped on the town of around 400,000 residents after it became centre stage for attacks by Muslim militants waging an armed anti-government campaign which has left 987 dead since March 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the measure devastated Mallawi, which had long been the main commercial hub for south Egypt, as more than 2,000 businesses went bankrupt and residents fled to find work elsewhere.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aside from the economic loss, the town became a site of mourning as many of its families had relatives in armed fundamentalist groups or the police force who died, or others who were simply killed in the crossfire between the two sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Around 70 police, militants and civilians have been killed in Minya province since violence erupted there in mid-1994, most of them in Mallawi or surrounding villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On hearing the announcement, overjoyed inhabitant's of Mallawi enjoyed their first full day of freedom on March 18, celebrating the end of the 17-month curfew which stifled the town, once the main killing ground of south Egypt's Muslim militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Youths sang and played horns and drums in the streets and sidewalk cafes swarmed with customers, the first time since October 1994 that residents were allowed outdoors after 6 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Today is a holiday for everyone in Mallawi,&quot; said Sayed Farghali Balih, 18, a housepainter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The lifting of the curfew was a request by the public to break the stranglehold which terrorism had placed around our necks,&quot; Hosni Abdel Karim Yunis, a pharmacist, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I just happened to come into town and was surprised to find this,&quot; said Ali Osman Ali, who left his failing car dealership in Mallawi to find work in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Once things calm down I am going to return here, because this is my hometown,&quot; said Ali, smoking a waterpipe at the Sohag cafe, where not a single seat was empty on the night of March 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I was not expecting people would come out so quickly after the lifting,&quot; said the Sohag cafe's owner Gamal Ahmed Hussein, smiling at the crowds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I used to have seven workers here before the curfew. I had to fire all but two and I still could not pay my bills,&quot; Hussein said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Merchants have been waiting for this lifting for a long time because the curfew paralyzed the market. Now all we need is for it to be lifted in the neighbouring village where we can sell our goods,&quot; Ali Mahmud, a shopowner said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The happiness here is indescribable. But it will only be complete if they decide to write off the taxes of all Mallawi's merchants,&quot; said Shehata Gadullah Saadullah, a tax collector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mallawi's lone cinema stopped showing films long ago and its owner began renting it out for weddings after slashing its staff from more than 20 employees to only two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But I think now the owner will renovate and start showing films again,&quot; Magdi Halim, one of the employees, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But surprisingly, Osman Mohammed Osman, the owner of the only hotel in Mallawi, which has a potential tourist draw in its numerous archaeological sites, was not enthusiastic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police took over his entire 45-room Semiramis to use as a base in their fierce repression of the militants. &quot;If they leave now, then the lifting is good. If not, then what good is it to me?&quot; Osman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alfi also said &quot;licences for automatic weapons have been cancelled for all persons, without exception&quot; amid an arms control campaign by the ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 3,000 other private gun licences have been revoked throughout Egypt &quot;due to the absence of sufficient reason for holding them or due to misuse of the weapons,&quot; the Interior Minister said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vatican City - Pope John Paul II on March 17 participated in the beatification of two missionaries, one in Africa and the other in China, despite intestinal problems that forced him a day earlier to postpone a visit he had scheduled to make to the Tuscan city of Siena.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 75-year-old Roman Catholic pontiff appeared at St Peter's basilica mid-morning to declare the beatification of Italian missionaries Daniel Comboni and Guido Maria Conforti, pioneers in the 1800s of &quot;a new missionary spirit&quot; for the Catholic Church in Africa and China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As he walked down the basilica's central aisle, the Pope stopped often to greet the ill and the faithful, and although his face showed signs of fatigue, he looked relatively healthy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the Vatican announced the previous day that the Pope would visit Siena on March 30 instead of earlier as planned, it said his health had improved &quot;markedly&quot; after a high temperature on March 12 that prompted him to cancel a public meeting the following day.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Pope left the basilica at around 10:30 a.m. (9:30 GMT) to return to his private apartment where his doctors had advised him to rest for a few more days, after Angelo Cardinal Sadano, the Vatican's secretary of state, had said mass during the beatification in the ageing pontiff's place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two beatified missionaries, Father Daniel Comboni and Father Guido Maria Conforti, were Italian pioneers of the &quot;new missionary spirit&quot; that gripped the Roman Catholic Church in the 19th century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Comboni, who spent his career in Africa, is being recognized by the Vatican as a &quot;genuine forbearer&quot; of modern missionary work, reflected by his principle: &quot;Save Africa for the Africans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ideas he promoted at the Vatican Council of 1869-70 were novel for their time -- a role for lay Roman Catholics and women in missionary work, for instance, and putting confidence in Africans to spread the Gospel themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Born into a gardener's family in northern Italy in 1831, Comboni became a priest when he was 23 and left immediately for Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He founded two orders, in 1867 and 1872, during the Vatican Council - - best known in history for enshrining the dogma of papal infallibility -- he got 70 bishops to sign a petition for the evangelization of central Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1877 he was named vicar apostolic for central Africa, as he continued to devote himself to his work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Comboni died in Khartoum, aged 50, but his work is carried on today by more than 4,000 so-called Combonians, including 14 bishops, who come from 30 countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They work in more than 40 countries in Africa, Asia, the America and Europe. Some have been arrested in Sudan and expelled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Comboni's beatification -- a major step on the road to sainthood -- follows nearly seven decades of investigation by the church which ended in 1995 with the acknowledgement that a miracle said to have been experienced by a 10-year-old girl in a Brazilian slum was attributable to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other missionary, Conforti, born in 1865, was archbishop of Parma, Italy for a quarter-century and became noteworthy for founding the congregation of St. Francis Xavier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This order is best known for its work in China, where its first missionaries arrived in 1899.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It continued to operate there until the early 1950s, when Chairman Mao Zedong broke off ties with the Vatican -- at the time very anti- communist -- and expelled all foreign missionaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite its expulsion from China, Conforti's order carried on its work but elsewhere in Asia, in Latin America and Africa, notably in Zaire and Burundi, where its members witnessed the inter-tribal massacres that left at least 500,000 dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two of its members were slain in Burundi last year, near Buyengero. The order today now counts 1,000 members, three of them bishops. Conforti died at the age of 66. His beatification process, from 1942 through last year, was completed upon verification of the supposedly miraculous return to health of a 13-year-old Burundi girl, who suffered from a tumor, in 1965.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pope John Paul II has in recent years beatified many founders of missionary orders.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - Mystery still surrounds the death of Prof. Rodney Belcher, the American orthopedic surgeon gunned down as he arrived for work outside his clinic at Old Mulago Hospital, Kampala on March 11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Initially, police said Prof. Belcher, 64, considered &quot;the father of orthopedics&quot; (bone medicine) in Uganda was the victim of car robbers, but it has since emerged that there may have been sinister political motives associated with his murder. His death comes in the wake of a spate of violence directed against civilians by rebels in northern Uganda. At least 200 civilians have died as a result since the beginning of this month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On March 15, the United States Embassy in Kampala summoned more than 100 American citizens living and working in Uganda to update them on security issues following the cold blooded murder of Prof. Belcher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Embassy spokesman, Julie Nickels said the meeting was convened &quot;to sort out the facts &quot;related to the murder of Prof. Belcher. &quot;We did not want them to depend on rumours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prof. Belcher's Nissan Patrol was discovered in a Kampala suburb two days after he was killed. Ms. Nickels read out the note discovered in Prof.  Belcher's car that said in part &quot;We did not intend to kill... We did not need the car...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some sources in Kampala said the killers were an unknown group opposed to the support given by the American government to the government of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. Prof. Belcher, a Bahai, was buried at the Bahai House of Faith on Kikaya Hill just outside Kampala, in accordance with Bahai tenets that a dead body is not to be transported on a journey exceeding an hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hundreds of his colleagues and patients wept openly for a man whose efforts have sustained the once run-down Orthopaedics Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among mourners was Ugandan Vice-President, Dr. Specioza Kazibwe, a surgeon who was a former pupil of Prof. Belcher, the country's Health Minister James Makumbi who posthumously bestowed on Belcher the title &quot;Honorary Consultant of the Ministry of Health of Uganda,&quot; the highest honour for the medical profession in Uganda.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - A statement issued March 18, 1996 by the Patriarchate said the aim of the recent publication of a book by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church (EOC) was to popularize the fundamentals of the Christian faith among its followers and foreign readers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement read out at an appraisal meeting indicated that the book would have a significant contribution in promoting the Christian belief among the Orthodox worshipers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the statement the book titled &quot;Belief, rituals and foreign relations&quot; will also have a role of facilitating mutual assistance with sisterly churches through the World Federation of Churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It sharply criticised demonstrators who took out to the streets last week demanding the evaluation of the book by elite's from churches and monasteries, saying that it was prepared and published with the approval of the church's scholars and the Holy Synod.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With regard to the construction of the Patriarch Palace, the statement said it is the living symbol of national unity, societal progress, the preservation of cultural and historical heritage's, and the dignity and sovereignty of the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The psychology of the demonstrators taken into consideration, the statement said, they are bent on attaining the sinister aim of personal enrichments under the pretext of protecting workers rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting attended by archbishops, administrators of churches and monasteries in Addis Ababa, the laity and students of Sunday schools as well as the elderly, has called on the faithful who, it said, innocently participated in the demonstration to refrain from such activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meeting participants vowed to stand along side the church which, they said, under the leadership of His Holiness Abune Paulos, Patriarch of the EOC, has registered remarkable achievements in the development endeavours.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The state-owned media tried to put a brave face on it.  &quot;Landslide win for Mugabe&quot;, trumpeted The Herald after the final tally in Zimbabwe's presidential poll was in. But nothing could disguise the truth: the result was a humiliating blow to the nation's 72- year-old ruler.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Robert Mugabe had been anxious to crown his fourth term with what his Zanu PF party had forecast as &quot;a crushing victory&quot;. Over his 16 years of iron rule, &quot;landslide&quot; and &quot;crushing&quot; have become common epithets to describe Mugabe's carefully managed electoral triumphs. All that is history now. Last weekend's contest may indeed have seen the incumbent raking in more than 90% of the votes cast. But with a 30% turnout of eligible voters, this was hardly the unambiguous mandate he had sought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The result is all the more remarkable given the pressure on voters to return the president to power. Rural voters were left in no doubt that the distribution of maize and seed packs was dependent upon their continued obedience. And village headmen were given the task of delivering their communities to the polling stations. White farmers, who had received the usual drubbing from Mugabe during the campaign, were also told to transport their workers to the polls. They dutifully obliged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the townships, bands of Zanu PF youths were despatched to find reluctant voters. Although Mugabe didn't repeat the scarcely veiled threat he made in April's parliamentary poll, that people not voting might be mistaken for opposition supporters, his officials did make it clear they expected people to vote in large numbers so there could be no doubt at home or abroad as to where the country stood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When his two lightweight opponents, Ndabaningi Sithole and Bishop Abel Muzorewa, withdrew from the contest, Mugabe went on TV to declare their withdrawal invalid, exhorting the nation to go to the polls. For once, Zanu PF's formidable propaganda machine failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a sense, Mugabe has been the victim of his own success. Having established a de facto one-party state which discourages dissent of any sort, he has been left in solitary possession of a vacant field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zanu PF secretary for administration Didymus Mutasa reflected a view widely held in his party when he told British journalists that &quot;Mugabe is our king. A king like Mugabe is not contested.&quot; He added disarmingly that &quot;this exercise we are only doing to satisfy outside interests&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president recently declared his opposition to reform of the Constitution which was tailored for a presidential dictatorship. But this latest hollow contest will now push reform to the top of the political agenda. In particular, attention will focus on media regulation, electoral laws, the sweeping Presidential Powers Act, and the Political Parties (Finance) Act which benefits only the ruling party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whatever is proposed, one thing is certain: Mugabe will no longer be able to claim the mandate of the masses in resisting change.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Secret discussions between King Mswati III and Nelson Mandela have left diplomats pondering the details of a policy they are to implement, reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PRESIDENT Nelson Mandela is playing his cards in the Swaziland democratisation game close to his chest -- so close, in fact, that Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo and South Africa's Foreign Affairs Department are in the dark about the details of his strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela has taken immense personal interest in helping Swaziland resolve its domestic crisis, which came to a head in January when virtually the entire workforce, led by the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions (SFTU), embarked on a one-week stayaway to demand a return to constitutional rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last Saturday Mandela, joined by his counterparts from Botswana and Zimbabwe, Quett Masire and Robert Mugabe, met with Swaziland's young King Mswati III in Pretoria. It followed a meeting on March 1 between Mandela and Mswati in Swaziland.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At both meetings, only the heads of state spoke and not even Nzo, who was at the Pretoria venue last weekend, joined in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This week neither Nzo nor Foreign Affairs Director General Rusty Evans had been briefed on what had been said, a senior Foreign Affairs official confirmed. South African diplomats admitted to a degree of frustration at not knowing the details of a policy they are supposed to implement, but acknowledged Mandela's indulgence of the king's need for absolute confidentiality may be the only way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have no knowledge of the contents (of the talks). It is quite a problem for us, because we have to work with it. Our Swazi counterparts also do not know what has been said,&quot; a member of South Africa's High Commission in Mbabane, capital of Swaziland, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he believed Mandela's strategy had a purpose: &quot;Mswati cannot be humiliated before his own people, and he cannot appear to be succumbing to pressure. But there will definitely be pressure on him, from inside Swaziland and from outside ... and from President Mandela.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mswati's father, the late King Sobhuza II, suspended Swaziland's Westminster-style constitution in 1973, banning political parties and free political activity. Mswati (27) ---who rules as absolute monarch, the last in sub-Saharan Africa -- has publicly blamed &quot;foreigners&quot; for the troubles in his country and, as a sovereign monarch in a deeply traditional society, has repeatedly demonstrated he will not appear to succumb to pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is widely held -- and South African foreign policy is premised on this assessment -- that Mswati is personally in favour of at least limited change, but is held back by his traditional advisers and the extended royal family, which stands to lose more from reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Around August last year, Mswati invited Mandela on a state visit to Swaziland, where it is understood he intended to use the cover of general relations to discuss the clamour for democracy in his country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While that visit did not materialise, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelethini had talks with Mswati in which the benefits of democracy and a return to a constitutional monarchy were apparently raised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then Mandela's deputy Thabo Mbeki was to have visited Swaziland during the labour unrest earlier this year, primarily to discuss a long-standing land claim the kingdom has against South Africa. But Mswati stopped the visit; a move interpreted by South Africa at the time as an attempt by the king not to have it appear that Mbeki was there to advise on Swaziland's internal situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Mandela was coming under increasing pressure to ensure Swaziland moves towards democracy. A source close to the presidency said Mandela, who had taken an active personal stance against Nigerian military dictator Sani Abacha, was being criticised for not taking an equally tough line against undemocratic rule in a neighbouring country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Congress of South African Trade Unions, which is close to the SFTU, also agitated for South Africa to get involved. &quot;We couldn't delay any longer,&quot; the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela invited Mswati to visit Pretoria on March 1. Mswati agreed, but asked for secrecy. When the President's office announced that it would take place -- apparently under the mistaken impression that it would be enough to keep the contents secret as opposed to the fact of the meeting -- Mswati called it off. Mandela offered to visit Mswati in Swaziland instead, where they had one-on-one talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is believed Mandela would have stressed to Mswati the importance of reform, but did not want to be seen again to be the &quot;bullyboy of the region&quot;, an epithet reinforced when Mandela outpaced his regional partners in criticism of Abacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela asked Masire and Mugabe -- significantly, the two who had helped him avert a coup in Lesotho in 1994 -- to join him for last Saturday's discussions in Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The source close to the presidency said Mswati had wanted this meeting to be a secret too, but it was confirmed when a Swazi journalist got wind of it. &quot;It is very difficult to keep a meeting secret if you bring together four heads of government,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - A key witness in the Magnus Malan trial has provided details of the close-knit relationship between military officers who ran clandestine supply lines to Renamo rebels in Mozambique and the covert plan to use Inkatha as a surrogate offensive force against the ANC inside South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of JP Opperman's rare outbursts in court this week about secret military operations outside of Operation Marion corroborates widely-held beliefs that support for Renamo and Inkatha were two sides of the same coin in the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When he was told under cross-examination that the accused would deny his allegations, Opperman announced he wanted to tell the court that they could &quot;deny as much as they like&quot; but he knew they had lied to the National Party government and the South African public for years after the Nkomati Accord was signed with Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked to explain what Opperman was getting at, Colonel Frank Dutton of the Investigative Task Unit said the witness had given the team an affidavit that describes personal involvement in clandestine support by special forces of the SADF for Renamo rebels in Mozambique in breach of the accord.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He alleges that in the early part of 1988 he and others drove a military convoy through the Kruger National Park to a fence on the Mozambican border. He says they stopped there and that Renamo soldiers climbed onto the trucks and offloaded the supplies. Radio equipment was allegedly part of the equipment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Much of the information contained in secret military documents placed before the courts detail how Operation Marion was seen by its architects as a strategy to turn the Renamo option, which had brought Mozambique's leftwing government to its knees, inside on the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The special forces unit that ran Renamo operations for many years after the non- aggression Nkomati Accord was signed with Mozambique in 1984, the Directorate of Special Tasks (DST), was the same unit that set up Operation Marion -- named for its aim to turn Inkatha into a marionette or surrogate of Pretoria's special forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The same men who ran Renamo operations from DST headquarters in Pretoria were responsible for implementing a State Security Council decision to set up Operation Marion. Three of the accused -- Brigadier Cornelius Van Niekerk, Brigadier John More and Colonel Cornelius van Tonder -- were directly involved in coordinating support for Renamo in direct violation of the Nkomati accord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The DST was also in charge of training Unita soldiers in northern Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opperman was the commander of seven Unita bases in the Caprivi Strip before he applied for a transfer to the base that had been set up in the same area for Inkatha's paramilitary squads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Atrocities committed by Renamo have been described by an American State Department report as worse than those of the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia. The cost of South African- sponsored wars of destabilisation in Angola and Mozambique has been estimated by the Southern African Research and Documentation Service in Harare at more than a million lives and between$45-billion and $60-billion since 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senior officials in the truth commission confirmed this week they will be monitoring testimony delivered at the Malan trial even if it is not directly relevant to the execution of the KwaMakutha massacre -- and that violations of human rights and international law, committed outside South Africa's borders, will be scrutinised by the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So if the evidence presented at the trial shows that some of the accused were involved in facilitating Renamo's abuses, described by some as among the worst committed in the world this century, it is likely they will be called to account regardless of the trial's outcome.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - People living in the Dukuduku forest on the outskirts of St Lucia are threatening to blockade the holiday town in peak season over the Easter weekend in protest against the Cabinet's move this month to ban titanium mining in the nearby nature reserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Local plans to organise a &quot;strike&quot; over the government's decision could embarrass African National Congress ministers Derek Hanekom and Kader Asmal, along with National Party minister Dawie de Villiers -- all three have committed themselves to consulting widely before taking important government action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On March 6 a ministers' committee -- made up of Hanekom from Land Affairs, Asmal from Water Affairs and Forestry, De Villiers from Environment Affairs and Tourism and Ben Ngubane from Arts, Culture, Science and Technology -- issued a statement saying dune mining would not be allowed so that &quot;the great tourism potential of the area can now be fully exploited&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A broad alliance of some 200 environmental organisations under the umbrella of the Save St Lucia Campaign has waged a protracted battle -- probably the longest and biggest green protest in the country's history -- to stop Richards Bay Minerals from stripmining the rare coastal dunes north of St Lucia dunes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They are delighted at the Cabinet's move, saying mining would have devastated a rare combination of ecosystems and that nature- tourism is bound to bring in more jobs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But representatives of the two Dukuduku communities told the Mail &amp; Guardian that the government made its landmark decision without speaking to them -- even though their livelihoods will probably be the most seriously affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of the elders who live in the Dukuduku forest were forcibly removed from the proposed mining site on the eastern shores in the mid- 1950s and feel they should especially have been consulted as formal claims for restitution have been lodged by their representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These people live a marginal existence in the forest, growing bananas and other crops illegally. They are among the poorest communities in KwaZulu-Natal and claim that nature conservation and tourism have always been detrimental to their lifestyles (see accompanying story).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A few of the residents told an M&amp;G team, who joined two community meetings in the forest over the weekend, that the government's announcement was no different to that of old apartheid decrees despite cabinet claims that &quot;amakhosi&quot; from the region discussed and agreed with the move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We can be happy if this government can take us back to the land. We should be part of the decision on whether Richards Bay be chased away from there or if we are to have nature conservation and tourism. We are the owners of the land,&quot; said an old man named MS Gumede at a civic meeting held on Sunday this week in a settlement called Dukuduku Two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The hostility expressed towards Cabinet over its St Lucia move appears to derive from a general perception among the forest communities that a top-down decision was made about how local peoples' land should be used -- thus pre-empting the outcome of formal land claims by two groups who say they used to live on the eastern shores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is all the same story,&quot; said Raymond Nkuni at the civic meeting. &quot;We don't know if we would have benefited from mining. We don't know if we would benefit from tourism and conservation. All we know is that nobody has spoken to us. Now that we have applied to get our land back, they are telling us what to do with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most people spoken to expressed general support for mining because &quot;you can see that we need jobs very badly here&quot; and an overwhelming hostility towards &quot;nature&quot; (the Natal Parks Board) who they blame for arresting people who go into the nature reserve to fish or to visit old ancestral graves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These sentiments were shared by speakers at another community in Dukuduku One which is made up of settlers who have invaded the forest and subsist there by growing bananas and sweet potatoes through slash-and-burn agriculture and by fishing illegally in the St Lucia estuary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dukuduku One is an Inkatha Freedom Party stronghold, while people at Dukuduku Two are politically non-aligned. The latter is a more settled area made up of people who agreed to move out of the forest in return for proper housing sites and the promise of development services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It thus appears that disillusionment in the forest at the Cabinet decision crosses political lines. Speakers from both meetings said they would back an Easter-time blockade during the peak tourist season at St Lucia -- - although formal threats and plans to organise the protest have come only from the IFP's Youth Brigade in the nearby town of KwaMbonambi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two groups of people who claim to be the legitimate owners of the eastern shores, one led by Chief Mineas Mkhwanazi and the other by Chief Phineas Mbuyaze, have lodged official claims for the eastern shores with the Land Claims Commission in KwaZulu-Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The St Lucia area was annexed as state land to the colony of Natal in 1897. People continued to live in the area and were removed in the mid-1950s after the area was declared a state forest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ministers' committee said in its statement that the decision to ban mining on the eastern shores had to be made urgently because &quot;the uncertainty had a detrimental effect on development&quot; and that it was taken only after discussing the matter fully with the KwaZulu- Natal government and the &quot;amakhosi&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It added: &quot;It was also decided that an application to register St Lucia as a World Heritage Site would go ahead urgently ... The Cabinet also decided that consultants be appointed to investigate and advise on an optimal strategy for sustainable development at St Lucia ... It was agreed that acceptable alternatives to the restoration of the land would be further explored with the affected amakhosi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hanekom's office failed to comment at the time of going to press when asked about the apparent discrepancy between his committee's claim that it had consulted the chiefs and popular attitudes expressed at the community meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asmal's office referred similar queries to the Department of Environment Affairs and Tourism. De Villiers's office replied by saying: &quot;The debate surrounding the future of St Lucia has dragged on for many years and during this time interested parties and stakeholders have had ample opportunity to make an input.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> De Villiers's officials, in turn, referred the M&amp;G to NJ Ngubane, MEC for Traditional and Environmental Affairs in the KwaZulu-Natal provincial government, for details about which chiefs had apparently endorsed the Cabinet decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ngubane's office had failed to reply to repeated queries by the time of our going to press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But representatives from some of the environmental organisations that ran the campaign to save St Lucia from mining admit that they found it difficult during the five- year campaign to recruit support from rural communities who have a stake in the future of the eastern shores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The only solution is action now with local communities coming into new ecotourism lodges around the estuary as full partners. We need to show in a concrete way that they can benefit more from mining than they would have from tourism,&quot; adds Wally Menne, a supporter of the Campaign to Save St Lucia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - President Nelson Mandela's office will spend R21-million this year, Executive Deputy President Thabo Mbeki R9-million and Deputy President FW de Klerk R12-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This pays for the smooth running of their offices and households: all three have offices and official homes in Cape Town and Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, the delivery of four luxury armoured Mercedes Benzes to the Houses of Parliament for Mandela and his deputies caused a stir when it was discovered the Department of Transport spent R1-million on each and has ordered three more for use in Gauteng.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the department's spokesman, Elsa Kruger denied the purchase was &quot;reckless&quot;, saying they had a responsibility to ensure the safety of the president and his deputies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the three-headed presidency does add an additional burden to the tax-paying public because of the addition of two deputies, surprisingly the trio's administration is still far more streamlined than PW Botha's Tuynhuys staff of 500. Their combined staff is 309.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Nelson Mandela's financial comptrollers received an explicit instruction from the South African head of state to keep his budget increase to a minimum this year -- - up from R16 299 000 to R21 705 000 -- because he wants to set an example of fiscal discipline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The R5-million increase, says his spokesman Parks Mankahlana, is a reflection of the increase of the duties and demands on the president which have spiralled enormously compared to those in the previous dispensation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other reasons were the implementation of the newly-appointed Commission on the Remuneration of Representatives at a cost of R1-million and an increase in the staff of the office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New staffers will be appointed in a new directorate of personal services and in expanding existing components of the president's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The largest allocation in the budget -- R17- million -- is for adminstration costs with expenditure for the 190 staffers increasing by 36 percent this year. Mandela had 206 staffers last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His salary is R552 000 a year, including a R115 000 car allowance. His budget also includes a salary of R352 000 for RDP Minister Jay Naidoo, including a car allowance of R70 560.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president's office employs six messengers, an operator, three drivers, two telecom operators, four secretaries, 19 typists, five accounting clerks, 11 clerks, four network controllers, one programmer, seven personnel officers, six registry clerks, nine administrative officers, four personnel practitioners, three state accountants, two communication officers, five assistant directors, nine deputy directors, six directors, two chief directors and a director general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His household staff includes 61 cleaners, three food service aides, eight household aides, a general foreman, a storekeeper, three household managers, one guesthouse manager, two household supervisors and two household controllers. The Department of Public Works employs gardeners and pays for general repairs and renovations, but no major work is planned for this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> R2-million has been allocated for Cabinet services, which involve providing secretarial and executive services to the Cabinet and its committees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taxpayers can rest assured: the president isn't planning any wild parties with their money. His modest entertainment allowance of R290 000 for the year, which he shares with his senior management, will be used for state banquets for visiting foreign dignitaries as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Executive Deputy President Thabo Mbeki asked for R10-million this year but was only allocated R9 387 000 -- an increase of six percent over last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Despite being the second most senior political office in the country, we have one of the smallest budgets and are headed by an office with the rank of only chief director,&quot; said Mbeki's spokesman Ricky Naidoo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Besides the ongoing responsibilities delegated by Mandela, Mbeki's office has the additional burden this year of establishing an Office on the Status of Women, Youth and the Disabled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbeki earns R480 000 a year, including an R80 000 car allowance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His staff complement grew from 50 last year to 63. His office staff includes five clerks, an administrative officer, an administrative secretary, a personnel assistant director, a financial assistant director, a chief director, an adminstrative director, a deputy adminstrative director, a driver, a minsterial typist, a network controller, a personnel practitioner, a messenger, a personnel officer, three private secretaries, a public relations officer, a registry clerk, eight secretaries, four special advisors and a telecom operator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His household staff includes a food services aide, a household controller, two household managers, two housekeepers and six household aides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The deputy president's office entertainment allocation for the year is R50 000, of which R30 000 is allocated to Mbeki specifically for meetings and consultations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It should be stressed that the entire allocation is not an entertainment allowance but is utilised exclusively in the performance of official duties,&quot; Naidoo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is also R10 000 allocated for gifts, used exclusively by Mbeki and his wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deputy President FW de Klerk's budget of R12- million may at first glance appear suspiciously larger than Mbeki's, but it includes major hidden costs as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is R2,3-million allocated for the General Services Ministry and a further R1,9- million for the investigation into lotteries and gambling. The budget allocated directly to De Klerk is R8-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> De Klerk's staff complement decreased from 61 last year to 56 this year.  There are nine vacant posts, which will be filled by General Services Minister John Mavuso when he assumes office at the end of the month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> De Klerk earns R480 000 a year, including an R80 000 car allowance.  Mavuso's salary is R424 000, including a car allowance of R70 560.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> De Klerk's office staff includes two fulltime and four part-time advisors, an office head, an adminstrative director, a communications director, a deputy adminstrative director, three private secretaries, two administrative secretaries, a personnel officer, a network controller, six clerks, a driver, a messenger, a registry clerk, four secretaries, four typists and a chief administration clerk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His household staff includes seven cleaners, three food service aides, four household aides, a household controller, a household manager and four housekeeping supervisors. The costs of managing his official household amount to R1 067 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His office provides advisory services to Mbeki and the General Services Ministry, as well as to National Party ministers on economic, constitutional, education, health and welfare and legal matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> De Klerk's allowance for entertainment is R159 000 with R10 000 annually for gifts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Lawyers are baffled at how Winnie Madikizela- Mandela's legal team handled the divorce, which ended so suddenly, with her defeated and empty-handed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A successful challenge to the divorce judgment in the Constitutional Court is seen as unlikely. Madikizela-Mandela must now rely on the &quot;goodness of heart&quot; of President Nelson Mandela, who has offered her an ex gratia settlement and waived legal costs she was ordered to pay.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has already paid her at least R3-million and two of his daughters R1,3-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lawyers said it was &quot;unheard of&quot; to request a postponement for reconciliation purposes. Details like these and the question of his assets would be discussed in pre-trial conferences. Madikizela-Mandela dodged confronting the issue until it came to court. But when it did, she and her legal team were entirely unprepared for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While weeks of court disclosures on more intimate details of the marriage would have ground the country to a voyeuristic standstill, the theoretical possibility exists that elements potentially harmful to the president's image could have emerged in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dismissing her advocate Ismail Semenya led Judge Frikkie Eloff to request her to defend herself. Unable or unwilling to do this, she did not arrive in court the following day and so lost the opportunity to fight for a portion of his assets. The judge could reopen the settlement hearing if she furnishes very good reasons for her absence in court within the next two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But legal sources say had she arrived in court that day and asked for a postponement until she acquired a new legal team, she would have got it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Having been married to the president for 38 years she stood to gain as much as a third of his estate. Or, had she simply settled out of court her settlement could have been &quot;handsome&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Madikizela-Mandela has since denied firing Semenya, a Natal University graduate and member of a panel of legal experts to the Constituent Assembly.  Semenya served on the Skweyiya Commission into corruption in former Bophuthatswana and co-authored a book on the draft Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The flagrant contravention by the media this week of a section of the Divorce Act has raised questions about whether that aspect of the legislation is unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The media had a &quot;field-week&quot; reporting on the ins and outs of the emotional court room drama of one of the world's most high-profile divorce cases -- that between 77-year-old President Nelson Mandela and his former wife, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This, despite the fact that the Divorce Act limits reporting on divorce to the names of the parties, the fact of the divorce action and the judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela, his legal team or Justice Frikkie Eloff could by rights have objected to the publication of details of the divorce and the transgressors (the media at large) would face a maximum prison sentence of one year and/or a fine of R1 000.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A member of Mandela's legal team said: &quot;I don't know what our client's attitude is. We did not discuss it and no one from our legal side expressed any objection. The publicity did not do him any harm. It would have done him more harm if the trial was held in secret.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added that the team would not want to enforce a ban whose constitutionality was up for question and that the &quot;paltry&quot; penalty for contravention would not act as a deterrent to the media in such a high-profile case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ban was a good one in certain instances, but should allow for discretion in cases like the Mandela divorce which contained elements of public interest, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most would agree that Mandela's almost indestructible image was in no way damaged by revelations of his private life. In fact, if possible, it was even enhanced, evoking deep sympathy for him from the public. But things could have been different if, for example, Madikizela-Mandela had given evidence and made damaging allegations against him. This was an unlikely but not impossible scenario given that she contested the divorce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to lawyers, this is the first time such a flagrant contravention has been made since the Act was amended in 1979.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The details of the divorce between high-flying socialites Philip Tucker and Anneline Kriel were reported only because they emerged in a criminal trial arising from dagga charges against the two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The issue highlights the tension between the public's right to know and an individual's right to privacy. Do public figures forgo all rights to privacy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Leading divorce lawyer Billy Gundlefinger said he was &quot;astounded by the flagrant disregard of the law by the media. Just because he's the president, why should he have his personal life paraded?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Constitutional expert Dennis Davis said it could be argued that the provision was unconstitutional in that it infringed on the right to freedom of expression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However he said he found it &quot;unbelievable&quot; that such a provision, no matter how controversial, was so brazenly breached. &quot;Being president gives you a reduced right to privacy but it can't possibly destroy your privacy completely. He might be the most famous person in the world but he is not public property.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Raymond Louw, chairman of the Freedom of Expression Institute (FXI), was part of a Newspaper Press Union delegation to the former government opposing the amendment when it was passed, believing that it was introduced to hide potentially important information from the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'm all in favour of divorce evidence being available to the public on the grounds that the public has a right to know,&quot; said Louw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He continued to say that &quot;double standards&quot; were implicit if people were allowed to listen to court proceedings but media were prevented from reporting them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I feel sympathy for the President that his private life has to be bundled out in public in this way, but this is the price one pays for democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Director of the FXI Jeanette Minnie said the public had a right to know about the divorce partly because &quot;the country has felt the ramifications of the tensions between the two. It has been part of the political scenario on South Africa over the past few years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The right to privacy versus the public's right to know &quot;are not in contradiction so much as that they encroach on each other. The constitutional court must balance them.&quot; Minnie said it took 10 years for a country to establish new constitutional law. The organisation is involved in a research project identifying bits and pieces of existing legislation that places curbs on press freedom.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - In the final adjournment on Tuesday in the case of Mandela vs Mandela -- waiting for the Judge President of the Transvaal, Judge Frikkie Eloff, to deliver the by-now inevitable decree of divorce -- the state president sat slumped in his chair, gazing into the middle distance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gone was his bonhomie with the press and his old-world gallantry with his beautiful junior counsel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the rare glimpse of misery on his unguarded face, it was possible to read the story of a family life gone wrong: the brutal break-up with his first wife; the loss of a beloved son in a car crash; the turbulent life of a fatherless Zinzi ... and now Winnie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have been fairly successful in putting on a mask behind which I have pined for the family, alone,&quot; he once told Winnie in a letter from Robben Island.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At 3.15pm on Tuesday the stony-faced mask of dignity was back on. But as Judge Eloff pronounced the decree, one could sense that behind the mask he was mourning another loss, another defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And yet, curiously, the divorce action represented yet another triumph in the life of Nelson Mandela. Because, behind the salacious detail of bedroom snubs, adultery and Winnie's extravagance, the court heard a testament from the president which was reminiscent of the glorious &quot;speech from the dock&quot; at Rivonia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ishmael Semenya, counsel for Winnie Madikizela- Mandela (as she now wishes to be known) faced an almost impossible task in his conduct of the defence and it was mirrored in the increasingly desperate smiles with which he met the president's rejoinders to his questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Semenya's task was to clear the way for two key witnesses underpinning the defence: the former security branch agent, Paul Erasmus, and Chief Kaiser Matanzima.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Erasmus was to give substance to that familiar refrain that apartheid was to blame -- that dirty tricks operations by the top-secret police unit &quot;Stratcom&quot; had poisoned the well- spring of the marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That established, Matanzima was to take the marital dispute out of the jurisdiction of the court into the realm of tribal &quot;custom&quot; in which the affairs of Thembu royalty were arbitrated and mediated by their peers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Semenya battled to breach Mandela's implacable refusal to give ground on either count. &quot;Winnie underwent gross persecution, brutal treatment by the police,&quot; conceded the president. But, he qualified: &quot;There were many women in this country who suffered far more than she did,&quot; citing Albertina Sisulu as an example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Madikizela-Mandela's counsel continued pressing the line of security police manipulation. &quot;I have never been influenced by my enemies, by those ... who sent me to jail for 27 years,&quot; the president flared with exasperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, he resorted to threat. Declaring there were &quot;even more serious reasons why I left home&quot;, he said: &quot;I appeal to you not to put any questions which might compel me to reveal facts which might damage her image and bring pain to my children and grandchildren.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Semenya had even more difficulty with Matanzima, Mandela bridling at every mention of the former homeland leader's name. Denouncing the chief as a &quot;collaborator&quot; and a &quot;liar&quot;, Mandela said: &quot;Nothing agitates me more than the attempt to bring Matanzima into these proceedings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The efforts by the defence to establish the superiority of tribal custom over civil law earned the court a lecture on the subject. &quot;I respect custom.  But I am not a tribalist. I fought as an African nationalist and I have no commitment to the custom of any particular tribe,&quot; he told Judge Eloff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As for the right of Tembu chiefs to interfere in a civil divorce suit: &quot;This particular kind of custom I am not even aware of.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was hopeless and Semenya knew it. As he bowed his way out of the cross-examination -- - &quot;no further questions, my lord&quot; -- the case was already over. He had failed to challenge the adultery allegation and failed to establish the faintest prospect of reconciliation. The president had shut him out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Judge Eloff finished pronouncing the final decree and rose, Mandela the litigant stood with the rest of the courtroom in respect for the bench.  Then Mandela, the president, barked an order to his aides who scurried across the courtroom to summon Semenya to his presence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The diminutive lawyer hurried, wide-eyed to him. Mandela solemnly shook his hand and congratulated him on his conduct of the defence. The mask was in place. It was the closing scene of a truly presidential performance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - University of Zambia acting Vice-Chancellor Jorry Mwenechanya yesterday failed to convince students who are on a class boycott over government's intentions to underpay them this month's meal allowance to resume normal activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have done just what you demanded, I have written the letter to the Bursaries Committee and the Ministry of Education is informed, the issue of the semester break is not a problem anymore,&quot; Mwenechanya reported to students who had earlier given him an hour ultimatum to sort out the two issues.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The class boycott which started on Monday evening caused confusion at the Great East Road Campus after students learned that government intended to deduct K21,000 for the week during which students will be on a Mid-Semester break which begins on Good Friday and that students will not be allowed to remain in their rooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwenechanya, heavily guarded by university employed security men had difficult time calming down the irate students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What I would like to appeal to you now is to leave the matter in the hands of the students executive,&quot; Mwenechanya pleaded. &quot;I would like the rest of you to report for normal class work at 14hrs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But students, uttering invectives and booing him, maintained they will not relent until they get their K90, 000. They refused to return to classes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The situation will be determined by the outcome of our meeting with the Bursary Committee this afternoon (Tuesday),&quot; University of Zambia Students Union (UNZASU) president Emmanuel Tembo said in an interview. &quot;Meanwhile, the class boycott continues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Efforts to get the comment from education ministry failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By yesterday afternoon, armed paramiltary officers were deployed along the Great East Road.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The United National Independence Party (UNIP) is working on what it calls a &quot;master plan&quot; to thwart any attempts to bar its president, Kenneth Kaunda, from contesting the forth coming presidential elections .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing pressmen in Lusaka yesterday, UNIP publicity secretary Bweendo Mulengela said the master plan was already on the drawing board and would be set in motion if attempts to bar Kaunda are made.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We will unveil our master plan if MMD attempts to bar our presidential candidate from contesting the forthcoming presidential elections,&quot; Mulengela promised, adding: &quot;The plan is already on the drawing board.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Mulengela declined to disclose the contents of the master plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I can't disclose what the plan contains as at now. But all I can say is that it is a peaceful master plan. It does not contain guns or bullets. We are a peaceful party and we always discuss peace,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mulengela was reacting to government spokesman, Amusaa Mwanamwambwa's refusal to yield to UNIP's demands that the draft constitution bill, which contains a clause which bars second generation Zambians from standing for presidency, be withdrawn from parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And in another development, Mulengela has announced that the UNIP central committee would meet soon and discuss health minister Micheal Sata's threats against Kaunda's relatives and other opposition leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I will consult the central committee very soon so that we can discuss Sata and then we may consider making a formal complaint to police,&quot; Mulengela said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia Amateur Swimming Union ( ZASU) president, Nangalingham Sothy- lingham, declared yesterday: &quot;I hate to predict that we are going to win.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Sothy- lingham, the first team will be termed &quot;Zambia&quot; and the second &quot;Zambia A&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We will field two teams with a total of 93 swimmers from the two teams because we want to win,&quot; disclosed Sothylingham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimbabwe will field 29 swimmers, Kenya 38 with a paltry 13 coming from the tiny moutain kingdom of Swaziland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Simon Faherty, who recently shattered four records at the Zambia Closed gala in Mufulira is expected to lead the Zambians to victory, especially that he has been listed for the 1996 Rothmans junior sportsman of the year award.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Zambia's only asbestos manufacturing firm, TAP building products, is to be sold for more than US$60 million together with the associated companies in neighbouring Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The companies will be sold to African Resources Limited (ARL) based in Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Managing director, Jeff Poole, said in an interview on Friday that TAP( holding company, T&amp;N Plc of Zimbabwe, had agreed in principle to sell TAP Zambia and other companies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is a deal that incorporates not only TAP but a number of our Zimbabwean operations. The total cost of the deal is US$60 million,&quot; Poole said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The announcement of the sale last week sent shivers among the workers who feared losing their jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Workers union secretary, Brian Kalaluka, said in an interview yesterday that workers were uncertain about their future under the new owners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There were fears of job losses and retrenchment among the workers when the announcement of the sale was made last Thursday. But after we met the management, we assured them (workers) that no one would lose his job as a result of the sale everything has since stabilised, &quot;fKalaluka said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And group marketing manager, Roy Shepard reassured the workers that no one would be retrenched on the basis of the company sale .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There are no plans for retrenchment that will come up as a result of the sale,&quot;fShepard said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Poole also shared Shepard's sentiments about the sale of the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is a very positive move for us. The new owners are very enthusiastic about the future,&quot; Poole said adding: &quot;Instead of being just a very small part of a large multinational group with diverse interests we are going to be the core business of the new owners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TAP has taken advantage of the monopoly in the region and recently sealed a deal with Malawi and Namibia to export roofing sheets worth K1 billion (about $ 1 million). .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Government has been urged to consider removing restrictions against foreigners buying shares in companies being floated on the Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE) for the first time to boost the securities business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chief executive, Mumba Kapumpa, told a seminar on Tuesday on emerging markets organised by Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) that the initial objective of enhancing share ownership by Zambians had largely been achieved with about 9,000 Zambians now owning shares in Chilanga Cement and Rothmans of Pall Mall which were floated last May and November.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Maybe there is need not to restrict shares to Zambians. The restriction was justifiable at the beginning but now it is unreasonable especially that we want to attract money into the the economy,&quot; Kapumpa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kapumpa, who was speaking in his personal capacity argued that since foreigners were allowed to buy shares once they were listed on the secondary market, they might as well be allowed to participate in the initial flotations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At present, deeds of the Zambia Privatisation Trust Fund (ZPTF) stipulate that shares previously owned by government can only be offered to Zambians through initial public offers while foreigners can only buy them once they are listed on the exchange through the secondary market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZPTF's Tom Ryan declined to comment on Kapumpa's proposal saying his job was simply to implement a decision passed by parliament: &quot;We are implementing something that was done by parliament in the Privatisation Act.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - A senior opposition leader and Human Rights activist fears that the judiciary in Zambia is likely to become subservient to the ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a paper presented at a one day conference on Southern African and Constitutionalism held in the Zimbabwean capital, Harare, last weekend Liberal Progresive Front (LPF) president Roger Chongwe said the courts were slowly moving away from their roles as protectors of the rights and liberties of the citizens.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chongwe said during the second republic where the former ruling party UNIP was supreme over the three organs of the state - the executive, legislature and the judiciary - the judiciary demonstrated its independence even if the Inspector General of police, the army and airforce chiefs became membes of the party's central committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Although there was strict adherence to the principle of the seperation of powers between and among the three organs of the state, nonetheless, as the years of one-party state took root and branch, pronouncements from the top party brass were to be heard entrenching UNIP as the supreme organ of the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The functions between those of the only political party and the government became blurred and so did the distinction between the state's civil service and the party oligarchy. In this atmosphere, one would have naturally expected that the Judiciary would be subservient to the party, but it was not,&quot; Chongwe said in his paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He explained that the period of one party state rule in Zambia witnessed the growth of judicial activism.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE) has won praises from London based stock brokers Cazenove and Comapany for its impressive setup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is a tremendous achievement at LuSE especially the depository and other systems in place,&quot; said Michael Wentworth-Stanley, a partner in the firm.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cazenove have been handling the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) shares on the London Stock Exchange since 1932.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wentworth-Stanley remarked that it was &quot;odd&quot; that there were only three listed companies on LuSE but he was sympathetic that the exchange was still in its infancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He suggested that the managers of LuSE should begin a marketing exercise to attract such investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;People to invest in small markets to exist,&quot; he said. &quot;The key to finding them is marketing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, he noted that lack of liquidity and access to credit such as exist in Zambia could be an inhibiting factor to such investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> James skinner who works in the Cazenove Johannesburg office said if more people like him came and were impressed, they would spread the word around about prospects in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier, Skinner said global emerging markets were attracting interest worldwide because of their tremendous gross domestic product growth potential which in many countries had exceeded the G7 countries average of about 2 per cent per annum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, he said factors which influenced investment decisions included sustainable economic growth, low inflation rates, deficit control, cost of capital and labour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting was organised by Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines and was attended by a cross section of the business community.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Many people are baffled by the Hon. Speaker's &quot;judgment&quot; leading to the jailing of Fred M'membe, Bright Mwape and &quot;fugitive mother&quot; Lucy sichone.In attempting to answer the numerous questions that have been directed to me on this matter, I have had to admit that I am equally baffled by the whole thing for it goes completely against my layman's perception of law and justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The only thing that did make sense to me though was Speaker Nabulyato's observation that this law is in fact archaic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He of course went on to say that archaic or not, it is still the law and we should all obey it until it is changed, or face the consequences as the Post trio have done. I have been pondering the speaker's words and I cannot but agree with his reasoning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I mean people have examined the articles by Fred, Bright and Lucy, virtually putting them under a microscope in a futile effort to discover what hidden meanings could possibly be lurking between the lines that warrant an indefinite invitation to a government cell. They've all come up with zlich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Archaic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If you happen to have had any luck, please let me know; I can offer K2m for the answer, but it would be nice to know. What is really baffling about this archaic piece of legislation is that it allows MPs to be stopped from debating certain issues. Quite recently in fact, the deputy speaker of the house stopped Hon. members from further debate on the defence budget. there was nothing wrong with that since the law allows it and the gentleman was perfectly within his rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> what is against the law is for anybody else to make any remark that just might be interpreted as infringing on the MPs' freedom of debate in the house, whether or not such a comment in fact does curtail the Hon. members' freedom of debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Competent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am not competent to judge which of these circumstances detracts more from the MPs' freedom of debate than the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What I am dead certain about is that Speaker Nabulyato was right:this law, if it in fact exists, is indeed archaic and needs to be changed. the sooner this is done, the better.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The state has sent out an urgent appeal to international donors agencies for funds to combat the deadly Larger Grain Borer (LGB) infestation threatening more than 15 million maize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government sources reveal that the target has been the European Union (EU).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I know the government has submitted a project proposal to the EU and they have expressed interest in assisting,&quot; the source said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Agriculture ministry permanent secretary Austin Sichinga acknowledged the presence of the pest but refused to discuss measures that have been put in place to combat the scourge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Zambia National Farmers Union (ZNFU) were more than concerned that the LGB has been allowed to spread to even the Northern, Central and Southern provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZNFU president Ben Kapita said the result of the infestation would be immediate not through crop losses but through the ban on maize movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Once the maize marketing season has begun, this will undoubtedly reduce the price of maize in the latter two provinces which are major grain producing areas, while increasing prices in the urban centres,&quot;fhe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last Friday, experts in the agriculture ministry's plant protection unit expressed despair about their inability to act against the LGB because of the lack of funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are waiting for a response to our requests for funding,&quot; a highly placed official said. &quot;It is a big project and it is not possible to use government funds alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials at the ministry of agriculture were yesterday locked in meetings with various officials possibly discussing strategies to combat the LGB.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Friday, chairman of the LGB national committee Songowayo Zyambo accused the government of not taking the LGB invasion seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Chiluba on Wednesday last week warned officials in his ministry of dire consequences for failing to inform him about the invasion of the LGB.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The pest has in recent months been imported in large numbers from Tanzania through grain. It was first identified in this country in 1993.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The ailing tourism sector is to suffer yet another blow, when the long serving airline, Air France, stops its flights to Zambia later this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a ticket sales official at the airline, the last flight into the country would be March 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is true that the airline's last flight into the country will be on March 27 but after that, passengers intending to use the airline would have to use Aero Zambia which will be our feeder airline to Harare, Nairobi and Johannesburg for direct flights to Paris,&quot; the lady disclosed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air France will be the second airline to pull out of Zambia after, Botswana Airways took a similar move two weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commenting on the development, prominent wildlife writer, Priscila D'elbee, felt the move would worsen Zambia's already 'chaotic' airlinks from abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Its difficult to tell people in France and Europe generally, how to get to Zambia especially with the worsening airlinks. People know Kenya and Zambia because of easy access to these places which have many direct airlinks,&quot; D'elbee said, adding: &quot;People are interested in coming to Zambia but the airlinks are rather confusing to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Chairman of the Hotels and Catering Association of Zambia, Gaudensio Rossi, said the drop in Hotel business was also a result of a reduction in the number of direct airlinks to the country and the government's continued delays in signing of the tourism lease agreements. &quot;Do we need to go to the President to sign the lease agreements, it simply means that someone is not doing his job,&quot; Rossi said adding: &quot;We feel badly let down by the delay and government should take the blame for our declining bsuiness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tourism minister, Gabriel Maka, refused to comment saying; he doesn't talk to The Post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tour Operators chairman, Mark Harvey said the develoment would adversely affect his industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This will have tremendous effects on our industry especially that the French have shown a lot of interest in coming to Zambia,&quot; Harvey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The problem of accessibility to Zambia has further been compounded by the transport and communications ministry's delays to award international routes to the local airlines which was due in December last year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Magistrates and Judges Association (MJA) and the Law Association of Zambia (LAZ) have described as a recipe for anarchy government proposals on the judiciary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They say the recent proposed Constitutional Amendment Bill which contains a clause which empowers the President to dismiss a Judge for gross misconduct is unprecedented in Commonwealth jurisprudence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both the MJA and LAZ have said this amendment is an erosion of the independence of the judiciary.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Draft article 98 (3) which provides for the removal of a judge from office by the president subject to ratification by National Assembly is a recipe for anarchy in that the term 'gross misconduct' upon which a judge will be removed will receive a subjective interpretation by the president and National Assembly,&quot; the MJA through its chairman, Timothy Katanekwa said yesterday, adding: &quot;where such a situation exists the continuance in office of judges particularly in circumstances where they preside over cases with political implications will be left to the pleasure of the President and the National Assembly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Katanekwa also declared: &quot;This situation is totally alien in the Commonwealth and an erosion of the independence of the judiciary which we feel is rather unfortunate and should not be allowed in our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also confirmed the views he was expressing were aired by judges at a meeting held last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And LAZ said the essence of the decision will give the President the power of interpreting the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The present constitution provides that the Supreme court will be the final body that will interpret the constitution or any written law. This is consistent with all constitutions in democratic societies. It is also consistent with the principles of separation of power and independence of the judiciary,&quot; the LAZ statement said yesterday, and added; &quot;It also inculcates the populace with a sense of confidence in the judiciary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Article 98 (3) &quot;a judge of the Supreme Court or High Court shall be removed from office by the President, subject to ratification by the National Assembly, for gross misconduct.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MJA feels that once the independence of the judiciary is eroded, the integrity of the judiciary will quickly follow suit and the nation will be placed on a fast track to anarchy as people might tend to take the law into their own hands.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is true Aero Zambia is adding another B737 QC aircraft to its fleet and that this aircraft is currently undergoing pre-flight tests in Johannesburg,&quot; general manager for marketing, Ivan Todoric said in response to a press query.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the aircraft which seats 100 passengers, with 12 in business class would be brought into the country soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The move which is certain to put the airline in a commanding position as far as domestic and regional flights are concerned has been welcomed by some travel agents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The move is welcome to the industry,&quot; said Deila Paulsen of Steve Blagus in Lusaka. &quot;Being a young airline, this will bring public confidence to the travel industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said with more aircraft, passengers were less likely to be completely stranded since another airplane could be sent to rescue them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She urged the airline to consider expanding its flights to more tourist destinations locally like Mfuwe, Livingstone and Kasaba Bay Lodge which have remained largely unserviced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, a new local airline, Eastern Air, will be inaugurated on Tuesday next week says Yusuf Zumla, its managing director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the airline will be using a 17 seater Let 410 turbo prop aircraft being leased from Slovakia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Thousands of convicts in Zambian prisons will not vote in the forthcoming parlimentary and general elections, it has been learned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Acting commissioner of prisons, Philip Sinyangwe, said in a telephone interview from Kabwe yesterday that prisoners have no right to vote under the Zambian constitution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;According to the law, once a person is convicted by the courts, he automatically loses most of his liberties and rights, and the right to vote is one of them,&quot; Sinyangwe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said no prisoner was allowed to register in the just ended voter registration exercise because they all forfieted their rights and liberties immediately the courts pronounced their imprisoment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But human rights lawyer Roger Chongwe said a prisoner is just as much human as any one else and should be allowed to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Even when a person is in prison, he is entitled to choose a leader of his choice, the difference is that he is confined to the prison,&quot; Chongwe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said if the constitution bars a prisoner to vote then it is inconsistent with the same constitution on the basic rights and privileges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Chairman for the magistrate's association of Zambia Timothy Katanekwa supported Sinyangwe saying: &quot;a person in custody can not vote, his liberties are curtailed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Katanekwa failed to explain what the law says on persons jailed for short terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Let me look at the law again and I will come back to you,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Lusaka High Court judge, David Lewanika, yesterday revoked the bail he granted on February 7, to Post editors Fred M'membe, Masautso Phiri and Bright Mwape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he stayed his own judgement and also granted the applicants leave to appeal to the Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In revoking the bail, Justice Lewanika said section 123 (4) of the criminal procedure code (CPC) was clear and mandatory that no person can be granted bail once the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) has decided otherwise.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The question of malafide does not arise and I am not competent to question the exercise of his (DPP) discretion. In the circumstances I have decided to review my decision and I revoke the bail that I granted the applicants on February 7, 1996,&quot; Justice Lewanika said in his judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But lawyer for the Post, John Sangwa later applied for an order before the same judge to stay his decision and for permission to appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The judge granted both applications pending hearing of the appeal in the Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The question of bail for the three editors arose in the case in which they are charged with receiving classified information relating to a story on a referendum government was planning secretly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They are also charged for having a prohibited publication Post edition 401 which exposed the secret plans for a referendum and was subsequently banned by President Chiluba under section 53 of CAP 146 of the Penal Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The State challenged the bail granted by Justice Lewanika and applied that he reviews his own ruling because section 123 (4) of the CPC under which the DPP issued the certificate did not require him to prove prejudice of the interest of the republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That the proof is a matter of evidence which can only come up during the trial. Further that the DPP does not have to furnish reason prior to the issuance of the certificates,&quot; the State Advocates, L.E. Eya and a Lewis argued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sangwa said the argument that the exercise of the powers by the DPP under section 123 (4) of the CPC cannot be questioned is not founded on law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He further submitted that it was a well settled principle that the exercise of any authority directly affecting the interest of citizens must rest on legitimate foundations of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judge Lewanika ruled in favour of the State but stayed his ruling.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Non-Governmental Organisations (NGO's) have deplored President Frederick Chiluba's remarks that they have no right to discuss matters of national interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba told a press conference last week Wednesday that he was &quot;baffled that most NGO's are externally financed and their leaders are not part time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That makes the character of the NGO's suspect and I become suspicious,&quot; Chiluba said adding: &quot;I have never heard of NGO's talk of national interest.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Principal consultant at the Media Resource Centre(MRC) Robby Makayi charged that the President was being insincere because he also came from an NGO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The president has forgotten that the Zambia Congress of Trade Unions where he came from is an NGO,&quot; Makayi said in an interview on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Executive Director for Inter-African Network for human Rights and Development (AFRONET), Ngande Mwanajiti called on the government to &quot;commend the role played by NGO's, churches and the labour movement in pressing for the re-introduction of a multi-party system of governance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The image of the NGOs has not changed since then. If anything, it is only fair for all those that campaigned for the restoration of democracy to ensure that the gains are not lost,&quot; Mwanajiti said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwanajiti also dismissed claims that NGO's were accountable to people who finance them adding: &quot;It is important to note that governments in Africa have tended to blame external forces every time citizens raise their voices.  The UNIP government blamed most of its difficulties on external enemies too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Non-governmental Organisations Coordinating Committee chairperson (NGOCC), Susan Jere also declared on ZNBC TV &quot;tell the nation&quot; programme last week that &quot;NGO's have the right to discuss matters of national interest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace secretary general, Father Joe Komakoma called on the government to desist from making accusations against NGO's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have no private agendas apart from reminding the government of what the Mwanakatwe Review Commission report says,&quot; Komakoma said in an interview last Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Youth Federation of Zambia member Lee Habasonda also charged that the government had a hand in the proliferation of NGO's in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The same MMD government signed an agreement with Southern University democratic governance project of the United States Agency for International Development(USAID), that is what has caused the proliferation of civic education organisations,&quot; Habasonda said in an interview on Saturday,adding:&quot;Therefore we have a common interest contrary to what the President said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Komakoma also disclosed that the &quot;Green paper &quot; of the citizens convention would be ready in the next two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The paper will be circulated to all NGO's, the church, the government and international organisations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - When the United Nations announced a $25 billion programme for Africa last Friday, it cited the end of the apartheid regime in South Africa and democratically elected governments in Angola and Mozambique as examples of progress that the international community must encourage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whether Zambia wants to admit it or not, the international community is linking politics to economy. It is clear that the donors are more willing to spend their money in countries with encouraging signs of democracy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations System-wide Special Initiative On Africa will seek to raise $25 billion from the World Bank, donor countries and other sources over a 10-year period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The funding will finance &quot;goal-oriented&quot; programs in such fields as education, health, food security, governance, sanitation and &quot;peace-building,&quot; the specifics of which will be developed by the African governments themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the $25 billion -which represents 20 per cent of the development money rich countries currently provide to Africa will come primarily from the redirecting of existing international aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Initially, the World Bank will be in charge of generating the funds for programs in the areas of health and education, according to the UN Development Program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UN officials said the effort is unprecedented because of the World Bank's role and because it marks the first time all UN agencies have agreed to coordinate activities to hold themselves &quot;mutually accountable for achieving results.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The development program comes at a time when the United Nations is facing the gravest financial crisis of its 50-year history. Officials, however, said they were confident it could meet its obligations because the program's funding will come mostly from private sources, wealthy donors and UN agencies that maintain budgets separate from the UN headquarters in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, an Egyptian, has long complained that Africa has become the &quot;forgotten continent,&quot; with the international community concentrating its attention and resources on areas such as the Middle East and the Balkans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UN officials have also noted that Africa's daunting problems have led to &quot;donor fatigue&quot; in the United States, Japan and Western Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While economic vitality has aided formerly impoverished areas such as East Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, Africa has steadily fallen behind economically, politically and socially.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations estimates that 54 per cent of Africa's people live in absolute poverty; it is the only part of the world where poverty is expected to increase over the next decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the continent's enormous resources, all but two of the world's 25 least developed countries are in Africa, according to the UN Development Program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Africa is a continent at a critical turning point in its history,&quot; the UN Development Program said in a statement. &quot;It is a continent beset by economic and social crises, yet it is also a continent on the march, full of promise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And that promising march should not be derailed by the ill-intentions of politicians who are just eager to stay in power by all means necessary.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - University of Zambia students yesterday barricaded the entrance to the campus demanding immediate payment of the promised K90,000 meal allowances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The students, who were chanting anti-MMD slogans, blocked the main entrance with huge boulders and tree trunks and for nearly five hours turned the campus into a no-go-fortress.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">They stoned any cars that tried to drive into the campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We feel cheated,&quot;an enraged third-year economics students said, adding; &quot;Government promised to increase our meal allowances from K60,000 to K90, 000 but up to now they haven't paid us. It seems the only language the government understands is violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another student added: &quot;Chiluba should not treat us like kids.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By 20.00 hours last night, the mood at the campus was tense as students milled around in groups plotting their next course of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a source at the campus, yesterday's demonstration was &quot;a harbinger&quot; of things to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The demonstration is continuing tomorrow (today) at 08.00 hours,&quot; the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The stand-off between the students and government started on February 20 when the University of Zambia students Union (UNZASU) reached a deadlock with the Bursaries committee over increased meal allowances for the students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the confusion that followed, two cars were smashed and the Great East road was momentarily blocked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After demonstrations at the ministries of education and finance and State House, students then gave President Chiluba 48 hours within which to solve their problems failure to which they vowed &quot;to do something.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba, in a bid to calm the situation, upped the students meal allowances from K60,000 to K90,000 but it appears government has failed to live up to its promise.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Two committees comprising scholars, political parties, the church and Non-governmental Organisations(NGO's) will be formed to pressure government to revise the current electoral law before the Presidential and general elections this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decision was arrived at on Saturday during a freedom forum discussion &quot;voter apathy-its implications&quot;, organised by the Media Resource Centre(MRC) at Pamodzi hotel in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Participants observed that the current electoral law contributed to the voter apathy because of the complicated procedures and systems being used.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Movement for Multi-party Democracy(MMD) chairman Sikota Wina,the first MMD official to accept an invitation to the discussions, admitted the laws needed to be changed but said they required more time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I admit that much has not been done in that area. But who is going to accept if we said we postpone the Presidential and general elections in order to facilitate the change of legislation?&quot; Wina asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But chairperson of the National Womens Lobby Group(NWLG) Gladys Mutukwa said there was still time to change the laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It can be done within this period especially that the government has shown that it can pass laws within 24 hours,&quot; She said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mutukwa's sentiments were echoed by Foundation for Democratic Process(FODEP) president Reverend Foston Sakala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We still have time. Let that law change to have a simple voting process,&quot; Sakala said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Director of elections Rabson Mwansa also alluded to the fact that the electoral process was being impeded by legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The MRC has also offered an olive branch to both government and the opposition to mediate in their intended talks on unconditional terms from both parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The forum observed that government was reluctant to call for the mediation talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But health minister and MMD national secretary Michael Sata said yesterday that they were ready.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are open for the talks at any time except that there are no political parties but names of people only,&quot; Sata claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MRC is the second NGO to offer to mediate after government's failure to respond to FODEP's request.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London - The financial and human cost of the war in Southern Sudan is causing tremendous problems for the National Islamic Front (NIF) regime. It's own propaganda machine is struggling to contain the news of military defeats.  The public in the North is well aware of the wounded soldiers filling the hospitals, even when whole wings of these institutions are sealed off from public view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officially, the public in Northen Sudan is being told that the regime's forces are currently pushing back the forces of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) and are recapturing the land and military outposts overrun by the SPLA since October. According to the Khartoum media, the regime's forces are poised to recapture the border outpost of Nimule. Lieutenant General El Beshir must dearly wish that this propaganda ws actually true because the reality in the South is extremely depressing for the regime.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kit River: The regime has no forces between Kit River, some sixty kilometres south of Juba, and Nimule. Its garrisons at Kapoeta and Torit to the southeast are both under SPLA siege. Three thousand troops of the regime had barricaded themselves into the Aswa valley following the SPLA's siege in January. The commanding officer, a major general, is presumed to have died with his men. The SPLA captured large amounts of weaponry and equipment including: three T-55 tanks; eleven 122 mm howitzers; nine 107 mm mortars; nine 120 mm mortars; sixteen 60 mm mortars; five 82 mm mortars; eight long range and fifteen short range radios; as well as seventeen heavy trucks and four pick-ups. Various hand guns, rifles, machine guns and a large quantity of ammunition were also captured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On 7 and 8 February, the regime's forces once again attempted to break through the SPLA's lines on the south bank of the Kit River. At least forty soldiers and officers were killed and around 130 wounded. Three officers killed in the attack were First Liteutenants Adam Harroun and Abdel Hadi Hassan Abdel Karim, and Second Lietenant Mahgoub Salih.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regime no longer announces the names of its troops killed in action because the numbers have risen so high that to make them public would immediately contradict the propaganda stories of battle victories in the South, which the regime is always portrayed as winning. The relatives of officers killed in action are still privately informed about their deaths, but relatives or ordinary soldiers are told nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SPLA has suffered losses as well since launching its offensive lst October. It would be impossible not to have done when faced with the regime's human wave tactics at Kit Riber. However, these losses have been light in comparison to those inflicted on the regime's forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whilst the SPLA regularly compiles lists of the regime's officers and men killed on the battlefield, the regime's forces do not do likewise with the SPLA dead. It would be interesting, if such a list existed from the regime's side, to compare its contents with that of the SPLA's announcements to its troops of the casualties it has suffered in battle. At present, the SPLA does not publicise such announcements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prisoners of War: One area in which the SPLA keeps meticulous figures is the capture of the regime's soldiers. The SPLA regularly hands over these lists to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which arranges visits to check on their health and conditions of captivity. Occasionally, the SPLA has made token gestures of releasing a few of its captives. The guerrilla army insists that large scale release can only be part of a final peace settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For its part, the regime claims that it does not have any prisoners of war due to its policy of immediate release of any SPLA soldier its forces capture. Strangely enough, not one SPLA soldier has ever claimed to have been captured and then released by the regime's forces. Many independent observers believe that the regime's forces simply execute any SPLA soldiers they capture in the battlefields of Southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other Battles: On 7 and 8 February, the regime also launched a second counter attack on SPLA positions at Labone. Nearly one hundred &quot;mujahideen&quot; were killed in the attack, including Lieutenant General El Beshir's younger brother, Osma Hassan El Beshir. Three other officers were also killed: Mohamed Harroun El Haj; Ibraham Harroun and Adam Musa Yagoub. Four officers were wounded and captured by the SPLA: Lieutenant Adam Abdulla Mohamed Musa and Second Lieutenant Ibrahim Izz El Din.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the past year, the number of casualties involving the relatives of prominent members of the NIF regime has steadily risen. A younger brother of the NIF leader, Dr. Hassan Abdulla El Turabi, was killed last year, as was a son of Ibrahim El Sunusi, another NIF leader. Despite forced conscription, the public is not rallying around the armed forces and instead actively tries to circumvent the recruitment of all the able bodied young men. The regime's leadership cannot refrain from sending their own sons and brothers to the war front if they want the ordinary citizens to do likewise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. El Turabi has been engaged in a recruitment campaign all his own.  His public utterances are becoming increasingly bizarre, suggesting that the physical assault on his person in Canada several years ago may have done more permanent damage than previously believed. In keeping with the official line that the war in the South is a holy war against infidels, he has regularly announced that all the &quot;mujahideen&quot; martyrs have gone straight to heaven.  Recently, he took that idea one step further and revealed that he had been divinely informed that each and every one of the regime's dead had arrived in heaven. Furthermore, he suggested that wedding ceremonies ought to be performed for them so as to mimic what God had already done for them in heaven. Anywhere other than Sudan, Dr. El Turabi would probably have been certified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Northern Fronts: The economy is bankrupt and the cost of the war is by now approximately $3 million US dollars a day. The money is simply not here and the attempts to find it are having a significant impact on the public. Even some supporters of the regime are beginning to complain about the situation. The atmosphere of rebellion and civil disobedience is permeating every level of society in Northern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations Security Council resolution demanding that the regime hand over to Ethiopia for trial three Egyptian terrorist suspects involved in the assassination attempt on Egyptian president Hosni Mubarek last June has added to the regime's problems. Whilst having no intention of carrying out the resolution, the regime's leaders know that the UN will not refrain from imposing sanctions on Sudan if they do not comply. The regime has realised that sanctions could sound its own death knell and so has frantically been trying to find a way around the resolution. All avenues have been explored, including attempts at reconciliation with opposition leaders in the North.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Storm From The East: A real worry for the regime's commanders in the possible opening of military fronts in eastern Sudan. The SPLA's New Sudan Brigade, the forces of the Beja Congress and of the Sudan Alliance Forces, are all said to be preparing to launch an offensive in the Kassala area. Such an offensive would definitely stretch the regime's military capacity to the breaking point. There has already been discussion in the leadership circles of the NIF about abandoning the South in order to defend Kassala, if necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the NIF regime's first line of defence in the east is still to maintain its accusations that both Eritrea and Ethiopia are planning to invade Sudan. Such a tactic cannot and will not deflect the opposition forces from carrying out their offensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wiliam Nyuon's Death: More evidence has come to light concerning both the regime's and Riek Machar's duplicity and conspiracy in the assassination of Commander William Nyoun Bany in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three weeks or so before his death, Commander Nyuon received news that a much larger force near Fangak wished to defect to his side. He set off for Fangak with some of his trusted old guard to protect him. It was almost as if he sensed that something was not quite right. His force was ambushed enroute and all of his guard was killed, including some of the conspirators in the plot who had not been told of when the final blow would come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khartoum has distanced itself from the plot, preferring to let Riek Machar claim to have killed Commander Nyuon in action. However, the planning, the weapons and the supplies all came from the NIF regime. Khartoum's intention was to secure the Eastern Upper Nile for Riek Machar's Southern Sudan Independence Movement (SSIM) as part of a political deal and a new era of cooperation with that organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khartoum's meticulous plans have not accounted for events since Commander Nyoun's death. The provisional executive council of William Nyoun's faction of the SSIM immediately elected his deputy, Commander John Luk Jok, as his successor. He has since travelled throughout Eastern Upper Nile consolidating his leadership and command of his faction. In addition, he has continued with Commander Nyuon's reconciliation with the mainstream SPLA, all of which has undermined Khartoum's attempts to re-establish Riek Machar as a credible military leader in the South.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London - In one of the most open demonstrations of support for the opposition National Democratic Alliance (NDA), the Eritrean government last month handed over the Sudanese embassy in Asmara for use as the NDA's headquarters. The building had been closed since December 1994 when Eritrea broke off diplomatic relations with the National Islamic Front (NIF) regime in Khartoum and expelled the Sudanese diplomats whilst withdrawing its own officials from Sudan. The NIF regime is currently complaining to anyone who will listen that the Eritrean action over the embassy building was illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The embassy was handed over to the NDA in a ceremony attended by representatives of the ruling Eritrean party, the Popular Front for Democracy and Justice. The Ertireans said that they were pleased to hand over the embassy building to the legitimate representatives of the Sudanese people so that they can carry out their legitimate activities of bringing about democratic change in Sudan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On behalf of the NDA, the chairperson and leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, Mohamed Osman el Mirghani said: &quot;From its new headquarters in Asmara, the NDA will now march triumphantly to Khartoum.&quot; He pledged that the NDA will make great use of the building by making a more concerted effort from within it to bring about a change in Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NDA representatives at the ceremony incuded: General Fatih Ahmed Ali, deputy chairperson of the NDA and leader of the Legitimate Command of the Armed Forces; Dr. Omer Nur El Dayem, secretary general of the Umma Party; Mohamed Tahir Abubakr, leader of the Beja Congress; Brigadier Abdel Aziz Khaled, leader of the Sudan Alliance Forces; as well as representatives of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), the Sudan Communist Party, and a large crowd of Sudanese residents in Eritrea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khartoum Complains: Since the ceremony, the NIF regime has complained to the Arab League in Cairo and the Organization for African Unity (OAU) in Addis Ababa. Exactly why the regime has complained to the Arab League is unclear, because Eritrea is not a member of that organisation . Perhaps Khartoum wishes to whip up racial enmity against the Eritreans! Whatever the case, the regime is unlikely to get much support in Cairo because its own rogue activities have done much to alienate many Arab League members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Eritrea is a member of the OAU, it is unlikely that the regime will receive any support there because it has regularly flouted the organisation's requests for it to curtail its rogue behaviour. In particular, the regime ignored the OAU's requests that it hand over the three terrorist suspects to Ethiopia that were implicated in the attempt to assasinate Egyptian president Hosni Mubarek. Khartoum refused to carry out those requests which forced Ethiopia to take its case to the United Nations Security Council, which has now condemned these activities and has given Khartoum sixty days to hand over the three terrorists for trial in Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unclear Status: Questions have been raised about the ownership of the embassy building in Asmara. It was said to have been given as a gift to a former Sudanese leader, General Abboud, by the Ethiopian emperor, Haile Selassie, the then colonial ruler of Eritrea. It is not known whether a reciprocal gift in Sudan was ever made. No doubt, the regime is looking into that matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When relations between Khartoum and Asmara were normal, the building's status never came into question. When relations were broken off because of the regime's misconduct, the Eritreans were within their right to take possession of the empty building that was naturally theirs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is far from certain whether Khartoum is complaining about the fact that the opposition have been given the building or if they were merely object to a building, that they believe they own, being given away. Whatever the objection, the fact remains that the Eritreans consider the NDA to be a government-in-exile and the regime as an illegitimate body that seized power from democratic representatives in a coup d'etat. As such, the NDA is entitled to make use of the building even if it once was a gift to the Sudanese state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would be interesting to see how the OAU would rule in this situation, although intervention by that organisation appears most unlikely.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Post Of Zambia (Lusaka) March 15, 1996 by Munachoonga H. Chipewo (Column)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The restriction by the President on foreign travel by ministers and government officials was one of the most important strategic decisions to have been made in many years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The wealth of a nation is made in many ways. Some of the ways are the additions in assets from the beginning of a particular period to its end, the rehabilitation of existing asset stock and savings arising from cost cutting measures such as the ones announced by the President.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The culture of spend thrift has not been with the nation for a long time. This is not surprising as the nation as a whole suffers from deficient strategic management practices. Strategic management of an economy whether macro or micro depends largely on the ability of middle and top management staff in politics and business to manage information whereupon a right decision making process can be based. In a nation where information management is strategic, invinsible costs, which in the majority of cases constitute 45 per cent of the total costs, are drastically reduced. There is really no compelling reason why home based ministers should be globe trotting spending an enormous amount of hard earned foreign exchange in terms of allowances and expensive air fares when the country is adequately represented in embassies of the countries so often visited. What are the duties of the ambassadors, trade attaches and whatever other titles they are called if they cannot represent the ministries back home?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This failure to practice management principles of delegation, communicating, co-ordination and decision-making affects not only the political sphere but the parastatal sector as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At one time, the former PTC won the best customer praise from Hotel Intercontinental because staff of the head office in Ndola often travelled to Lusaka on business en masse in spite of the existence of middle management staff representing the Head Office, who could submit information required by management for decision making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In TAZARA and Zambia Railways, it is common to see scores of managers on 'trips' from head office and regions spending millions on Kwacha on subsistance for no results at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In ministries such as education, agriculture and the like, chief officers regularly travel to provinces and districts and yet no impact of the visits is made as schools are getting dirtier every day and extension workers do not even visit the farmers to advise them on how to preserve the little food they have produced, all because officers do not travel to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is, therefore, safe to say that the motive for travel among politicians and management staff in parastatal organisations is not service to a large extent but earning of extra income for personal wealth at the expense of national development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What has happened, therefore, should be commended because if it persists, it will bring about a new culture of work in government and ministers will ensure that their ministries design effecient information systems for efficient performance. The top-down and bottom-up management information strategy will definitely show up sooner that later the majority deadwood in the civil service locally and abroad and will give ministries the chance to boot them out on incompetence as part of the civil service reform programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the moment they are hiding behind the visitations of bosses at places of work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The nation has to start from somewhere. Cost cutting should be enhanced everywhere in the nation if we are to develop. This should include chief executives who play Golf during working hours when they are supposed to be in their offices producing and solving company problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is so much play than work in this country that this has ultimately made Zambia a dull boy when others are busy working and developing. The sooner this is realised, the better.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But MMD national secretary Micheal Sata said every party has the right to choose a presidential candidate, but that candidate must qualify to the requirements of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Any party can field their candidate, but he must meet the requirements of the law, if he does not, then it's hard luck,&quot; Sata said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We dare you Mr. Chiluba to face Dr Kaunda in a free and fair election, remember what you said at the Lusaka International Airport upon your return from Israel: 'everybody is welcome, it will be a nice tangle to welcome him (Kaunda) in the political field, we will defeat him again,'&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added that the government has the responsibilty of creating conditions under which peace and stability will prevail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;And these conditions can only be guaranteed by withdrawing the proposed constitutional bill,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What about all these threats from UNIP and ZDC on civil disobiediance and violence, we do not want to be caught napping, and government has sent them to acquire new knowledge in various military discplines including guerilla warfare&quot; Sata said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sata's admission is further confirmation that there is more to the relationship between the Zambia government and the Israeli intelligence service Mossad. Last year some diplomatic sources observed that about 500 MMD cadres were trained in subversion by Mossad between September and October in Chief Chiawa's area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Inyambo yesterday claimed MMD is training people in Israel to help in rigging the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot; We have information MMD has sent people to train in Israel to come and rig elections,&quot; Inyambo claimed and denied his party was training an army in South Africa and Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inyambo described MMD Lusaka province chairman Christoper Chawinga's allegations as &quot;total rubbish&quot; and challenged police to get Chawinga to prove his allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's rubbish, and I challenge police to get Chawinga to prove his allegations against our party, it is not true, UNIP is not training any army,&quot; Inyambo said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Chawinga yesterday refused to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Not now, let them go to court then I will be more than ready to prove my allegations,&quot; Chawinga said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE) has revoked Meridien Securities Limited (MSL)'s membership for failing to comply with requirements and rules of the exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LuSE board chairman, Tom Ryan, disclosed in an interview on Monday that the decision to revoke MSL's membership was jointly arrived at by the LuSE board recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The decision was arrived a couple of weeks ago by the LuSE board and the revocation was effective February 29,&quot; Ryan said in an interview on Monday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LuSE general manager, Charles Mate disclosed that the move was in line with bringing order in the market and also to enable continued participation of MSL investors .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said among the rules that MSL had failed to comply with were their failure to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The MSL has not applied to the SEC for membership this year and it seemed fair to revoke their membership. The list of brokers has already been published by SEC and MSL did not apply,&quot; Mate said .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He revealed that LuSE was trying not to disadvantage the investors who had bought shares on the exchange through MSL as they could not trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What we have done is to allow the free transfer of shares from MSL to other registered brokers so that they can start trading on the exchange,&quot; Mate said adding that: &quot;We want to bring order and clarity in the market .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LuSE has since advised all investors with shares purchased under MSL to transfer their accounts to other brokers of their choice who are members of the exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A statement from LuSE sent to the investors, disclosed that the transfer of shares would be done free of charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trading in Meridien Baby Bonds and Meridien Family Bonds which were being offered by MSL on LuSE was suspended in June last year following problems arising from the closure of the holding company Meridien BIAO Bank in May.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Ugandan authorities are organising a mass funeral for a large proportion of travellers among the 110-plus people killed in a rebel ambush of a 17-vehicle convoy travelling between the capital Kampala and West Nile area of north-western Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The vehicles were hit by the rebels in the Murchison Falls Park area between Karuma and Pakwach, some 250 kilometres from Kampala on the afternoon of March 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest deaths bring to more than 200 civilians believed killed as a result of the activities of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) of Joseph Kony, often described by newspapers as a Christian fundamentalist group &quot;who want to rule Uganda according to the 10 Commandments of the Bible&quot;. However, the killing of innocent civilians is the hallmark of their terrorist activities in the rural areas of Kitgum and Gulu Districts of northern Uganda, home to the Acholi people who straggle northern Uganda and southern Sudan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The LRA is an offshoot of a Holy Spiritist movement led in the mid- eighties by Prophetess Alice Lakwena now in exile in Kenya. Hundreds of the rebels died in attacks against the Ugandan Army between 1985 and 1987 as they believed the Holy Spirit would grant them the magic to withstand army bullets. Joseph Kony, believed to be about 35 is a relative of &quot;Prophetess&quot; Lakwena.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rebels' cruelty to civilians has turned people against them in Kitgum and Gulu Districts where they indulged in abducting villagers for forceful conscription, raping women, sometimes slashing off their noses with machetes for no apparent reason. Many of the survivors of past attacks have been treated by Italian missionary workers, at Lacor Hospital in Gulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The March 8 carnage between Karuma and Pakwach is the second incident in less than a year in which more than 100 innocent civilians have lost their lives. In April 1995, the LRA mowed down 250 civilians at Atiak near the Sudanese border. These were subsequently buried in a mass grave. That massacre caused a major diplomatic row between Sudan and Uganda with each ordering out the other's envoys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Diplomatic relations were terminated with Uganda accusing Sudan of arming the LRA. Sudan in turn has accused Uganda of supporting the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) of Colonel John Garang. In November 1995, the SPLA, seemingly in a resurgence, smashed Sudanese government garrison towns at Palutaka and Parajok in southern Sudan and have large areas now under their control. Indeed during their offensives in November and December last year, they seized over 200 LRA trainees working alongside the Sudanese Army, and handed them over to Ugandan authorities. At the time, Ugandan authorities believed Kony was finished but senior LRA operatives withdrew deeper into Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In early February, at least 550 rebels were noted crossing back into Uganda at Bibia crossing point on the Uganda/Sudan border. Between then and the March 8 carnage, the rebels have engaged the Army in a number of hit and run attacks, leaving at least 50 soldiers dead, while rebel losses are put at more than 120 men and many injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF) lost another 20 men leading the 17 vehicle convoy atop Tata trucks. Badly outnumbered by at least 20 to one, the army truck and its occupants appear to have been destroyed by a rocket propelled grenade. The rest of the convoy was sprayed with sub-machine gun fire by rebels who had positioned themselves on both sides of the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Survivors have given harrowing accounts of what happened in the immediate aftermath of the attack. Mubarak Belwa, a driver of one of the ambushed buses recovering in hospital in Kampala where the Army took him and 15 other severely injured survivors, said he saw &quot;very many bodies&quot; both inside and outside the six buses in the 17-vehicle convoy. Abductees who numbered several dozens were forced to carry property pillaged from the buses and trucks. The rebels set alight most of the trucks including 4x4 wheel drive vehicles in the convoy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One woman who survived the carnage and managed to escape said rebels forced her to throw away her dead child with whom she had refused to part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The driver, Belwa, corroborated earlier accounts of rebels being &quot;heavily armed.&quot; Rebels who surrendered to the Army said that while in Sudan, they had been given a light machine gun, LMG, anti- personnel and anti-tank mine, and Sudanese Army uniforms while others carried armour piercing weapons, rocket propelled grenades and mortar bombs, reportedly with Arabic inscriptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following the March 8 attack, a terse military statement signed by Uganda's Defence Minister Amama Mbabazi said: &quot;It is with profound shock and sorrow that the Ministry of Defence informs the country of the loss of lives in an attack by Kony outlaws on a convoy travelling from Kakuma to Pakwach.&quot; The statement described the attack as an act of barbarity and bestiality and went on to promise the government's commitment to the eradication of rebels in the north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the massacres at Karuma have already ignited recriminations. Defence Minister Mbabazi had previously said, &quot;we are not scared of any invasion from Sudan. Why should we deploy heavily?&quot; When the SPLA struck LRA training camps in Sudan last November, Mbabazi predicted the LRA &quot;were finished.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now Mr. Mbabazi has blamed the Army for negligence particularly the ineffective surveillance of the Karuma - Pakwach stretch where the massacre happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Army has logistical problems of its own. The UPDF Chief of Combat Operations, Brigadier Joram Mugume had sensed trouble on that stretch two weeks earlier and ordered the road closed between February 23 and 25. He lamented poor telecommunication facilities in the field had hampered work at his headquarters in Kampala. The Army was particularly worried about landmines hitting even the best protected convoy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now there is a feeling of great insecurity all over Gulu District. In particular, the Gulu-Kampala, Gulu-Kitgum, Gulu-Moroto, Gulu- Adjuman roads are now prone to rebel attacks. Moreover in the bush country of Acholi land, rebels roam at will, especially in the night. They set on fire villages they attack, destroying granaries as a strategy to force the people to flee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are reports of rebels issuing leaflets in Acholi language, saying all homesteads should be moved four kilometers from any highway. This appears to signal a campaign to make travel impossible in the region. Needless to say, people are fleeing in large numbers to the towns, particularly Gulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition leader and presidential aspirant, Dr. Paul Ssemogerere says there should be &quot;an international inquiry&quot; into the situation in the north of the country. Acholiland was previously a stronghold of the Democratic Party (DP). With elections due in May, it is unlikely that security would be guaranteed for him for the purpose of electioneering or peaceful voting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda's top military men and President Yoweri Museveni are reported to be meeting to work out how best to defeat the rebels. The 4th Division Commander, Brigadier Cheefe Ali has however accused some Acholi people of supporting the rebels despite the pain they are causing to their own people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similar sentiments are echoed by Mrs. Betty Bigombe, an Acholi, who is State Minister in Charge of Pacification of the North.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - In a recent Friday Prayers sermon, Kenyan Islamic scholar, Sheikh Ali Shee, the chief Imam at Nairobi's Jamia Mosque, dedicated his day's preaching to unity among the people of Allah (God).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We must accept and believe that we are people of one Allah (God) and we must keep peace, unity and understanding among ourselves, for that is what Allah (God) expects from us, the Islamic leader appealed to the packed congregation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He stressed that it mattered less whether one is Christian or Muslim.  &quot;We are all children of one Allah (God),&quot; he told the mid-day Islamic worshippers. He reminded his congregation that many wars and civil strife have surfaced in Africa and other parts of the world, because people have defied God's wish that all must live together as children of one Allah (God).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He summarized his sermon thus, we have no choice but to abide by the tenets of love, peace and understanding among ourselves to avert the current material and human destruction that the world is witnessing today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For a passer-by, the Imam's message may not be any different from other sermons delivered by Islamic preachers. But those who have closely followed the recent trends of inter-faith relations will agree that there is need to build and promote relations between the faithful of both religions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vatican's Pontifical Council for Inter-Religious Dialogue, a department currently headed by Nigerian Cardinal Francis Arinze, is charged with the responsibility of promoting and developing effective communication between the Catholic Church and people of other faith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Through this department Pope John Paul II in February sent a message of congratulations to the worldwide Muslim community as they celebrated the end of the holy month of Ramadhan. &quot;For us as Christians and Muslims to reach beyond tolerance to reconciliation and love, there is still a long way to go.  Christians and Muslims can become an example of reconciliation and instruments of peace in today's world,&quot; the Pope's message based on the theme-Beyond Tolerance said in part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Africa major Protestant churches through the Project for Christian-Muslim Relations in Africa (PROCMURA) hope to institute and promote better and effective relations between the Christians and Muslims on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our mission is simple. Helping both Christians and Muslims live together harmoniously in their day-to-day life. One of our major concerns is the formation of Christian-Muslim relations committees at the lowest levels such as parishes, dioceses and villages,&quot; stresses Rev.Dr. Johannes Haafkens who heads the PROCMURA office from the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. PROCMURA was begun in 1959.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He says such committees have made remarkable achievements in various parts of Africa. However, he notes that there are incidences in which issues have gone out of control, resulting in &quot;bad blood&quot; between members of the two communities. Cases of fighting have been reported resulting in physical injuries to individuals, property loss and damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Haafkens cited countries like Nigeria and Egypt, where hostilities between Muslims and Christians have resulted in loss of life on both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Talking to APS recently, Sheikh Ali Shee said he was concerned about some &quot;grey areas&quot; that still exist in the process of inter-faith relations.  &quot;I am disturbed by some people in the Christian world who either write books, articles or use the mass media in general to mar the good name of Islam,&quot; cautioned the Islamic leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ali Shee was alluding to a February 15 report, Islamic Expansion in Eastern Africa? What is Our Responsibility? written by the Rev. Wolfgang Schonecke for the Association of Member Episcopal Conferences in Eastern Africa (AMECEA) Documentation Service. AMECEA comprises Catholics in the East and Central African countries of Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Malawi, Zambia, and Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;While the report has some basic truth about the picture of the Islamic faith in the region, some information has either been jumbled up or messed up to give the wrong picture. I would quickly want to single out the researcher's table of statistics showing the population of Muslims in the various countries in the region,&quot; said Sheikh Shee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Referring to statistics listed under, RELIGIOUS STATISTICS FOR AMECEA COUNTRIES, credited to the Catholic Mission Education Centre (CAMECO-1990) and Barret's works in &quot;MUSLIMS, Nationalities of the World&quot;, the Nairobi Imam questioned figures which indicate that Muslims comprise only six per cent of Kenya's population of about 25 million. The Islamic scholar said the figures given represent the population of Muslims somewhere before independence in 1963. He argued that Kenyan Muslims are currently about 30 per cent of the national population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think the challenge is for both Christians and Muslims. We must strive to reflect the true picture of each of us in the best way possible. We must try to be open to each other and refrain from mispresenting facts on and about each other. This is vital in the new world of opening up to each other,&quot; explained Sheikh Ali Shee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his report, Rev. Fr. Schonecke, a member of the Catholic Order of the Missionary Society of Africa, says Christians have an in-built fear of Islam and their reactions go from anxiety or panic to explaining Islamic revival away in terms of petrol-dollars. But neither fear nor illusion are good guides to creative action, he argues, adding; &quot;If anything, Islamic revival is a challenge to Christianity's complacency and shows up the weaknesses and shortcomings of our evangelising efforts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fr. Schonecke laments that there is a great mutual ignorance of Christians and Muslims, which he says breeds prejudice and false fears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A better catechism adapted to the context of Islamic proselytism could help, he recommends, adding that this would show the common ground of shared values and beliefs in both religions and speak with respect of the meaning of the various religious rites and practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This would also go a long way to explain mysteries that are particular and fundamental to the Christian faith, such as the trinity, and sonship of Jesus, in a way that is meaningful to their own life and at the same time intelligible to Muslims, he further recommends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fr. Schonecke says the resurgence of Islam in Eastern Africa cannot be overlooked. It shows itself not just in the countries with a traditionally high proportion of Muslims but also in countries where not too long ago, Islam was virtually absent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Catholic priest cites the spread of thousands of mosques in every village or every quarter of town amplifying the call to prayer; Islamic universities, schools, dispensaries and cultural centres; Islamic television programmes, video and newspapers; Islamic political parties or organisations; Islamic bank and financial institutions as well as the Islamic dress as the clearest signs of Islamic expansion in the Eastern African region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the report, Muslims take new pride in their religion and way of life, claim a greater role in society and display great zeal to convert others to their religion. The proclaimed aim of Da'wa Al- Islamiya (Islamic Mission/Call) is to make Africa islamic by the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the subtitle-Christian Challenge, the AMECEA report says mosques and Islamic centres are often the centre of the community, not just for prayer, but also places of meeting, discussion, study and leisure for the young and old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where priests see their function mainly as liturgical, parishes tend to overflow on Sundays, but are dead for the rest of the week, points out Fr.  Schonecke. He recommends, &quot;we need to have a holistic vision of faith and of church, to make our parishes and outstation the home of the community where not only religious ceremonies, but the celebration of all aspects of life takes place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the subject Dialogue, the Catholic priest, suggests that the majority of moderate Muslims could be encouraged and supported in their efforts to reject violent extremist elements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The paper also suggests that meetings and exchanges between Christian and Muslim theologians in universities and seminaries could foster personal links and help to remove mutual distrust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also recommends that an up-dated catechism can overcome the great ignorance of most Christians about Islam, make them aware of the common beliefs and moral values in both religions, help Christians to be able to express the fundamentals of faith in intelligible form and be aware of weaknesses and contradictions within Islam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The AMECEA paper describes Africa as a continent with a strong tradition of religious tolerance where Christians, Muslims and traditionalists live peacefully in the same family, but cautions that &quot;the same tradition is being threatened by small groups of religious extremists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dialogue of life, joining in family feasts, marriages and funerals and showing respect and interest in each other's religious celebrations, should be positively encouraged, says Fr. Schonecke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pointing out that the media can give the impression that Islam as a whole has become aggressive, fundamentalist, violent, more visible, noisy and seeks political power thus creating fear in many Christians, Fr. Schonecke recommends that Christians need to be prudent, nuanced and Gospel-inspired when reacting to such opinions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fr. Schonecke ends his paper with a strong quote from Pope John Paul II in the book, The Church in Africa (Ecclesia in Africa) - Post- Synodal Apostolic Exhortations, that &quot;commitment to dialogue must also embrace all Muslims of good will. Christians cannot forget that many Muslims try to imitate the faith of Abraham and to live the demands of the Decalogue.  Christians and Muslims are called to commit themselves to promoting a dialogue free from risks of false irenicism or militant fundamentalism and to raising their voices against unfair policies and practices, as well as against the lack of reciprocity in matters of religious freedom.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report evolves around 94 questions whose approach is based on the United Nations Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and the Prison Act of Zimbabwe under 12 topics which include; health and hygiene, food and nutrition, accommodation and sleeping facilities, the position of women, guard brutality and humanity among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zimbabwe CCJP team also noted views from prisoners. However, researchers took into account the fact that the attitude of inmates towards certain issues may be clouded and influenced by bitterness towards incarceration. Thus, the opinions of prison administrators were a major component of the study.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CCJP report particularly focused on the overcrowding aspect, poor diet, lack of ventilation and exercise and unhygienic conditions culminating in numerous respiratory diseases such as pulmonary tuberculosis.  Other ailments include dysentery, diarrhoea, eye infection and skin diseases.  Incidences of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) were also linked to poor conditions in Zimbabwe's prisons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most prisons were found to be bursting at the seams - for example 24 people squeezed together in a small cell measuring 3.5 x 4.5 metres and 18 in a cell measuring 4 x 6 metres is serious overcrowding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As prisoners literally &quot;sleep on top of each other&quot; in some jails, detailed accounts of the prevalence of homosexuality were given at WhaWha Medium Prison in central Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A remand prisoner facing fraud charges said; &quot;Homosexuality is rampant.  We are dying in this place. Some of the guys in there have been there too long. Usually however, they establish a permanent understanding with a person, but you see, this is remand. We are constantly moved and partners are separated and the rest of us are harassed. The victims get food or sweets for services rendered. For those who do not get visitors, the offers are attractive enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He noted that &quot;no one attempts to make a report any more because the guards do not respond at all. If they do, they take their time. Meanwhile, danger will be looming in the cells. Once, an elderly white man reported his case. He was beaten at night and is now partially deaf.&quot; An account of sexual harassment in the prison truck to and from court was also given by a female prisoner serving a 16- year term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women to a certain extent are a special category of prisoners, requiring facilities not otherwise needed by male inmates, such as sanitary towels whenever the need arises. But these are not provided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At Mutoko Prison in the north-eastern part of the country, a female inmate imprisoned for infanticide faked illness during her menstruation period so that she could stay in the cells since she did not have sanitary towels. Another woman at Mutare Prison said she had to use her daughter's nappies during her cycles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pregnant female prisoners also require medical check-ups. Participants in a group discussion at Chikurubi Female prison cited a case whereby an inmate had labour pains but was ignored and told to wait for transport which hardly ever came. It is not uncommon for babies to be born in the prison cells without receiving any medical attention. The prison nurses did not work at night. Chikurubi Female Prison has a capacity of 287 but holds a population of up to 430 inmates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Provision for babies born in prison is also a matter of serious concern.  Once an inmate had delivered, she would be transferred to a maternity cell.  Chikurubi Female Prison has four such cells, each holding 38 inmates with babies. Although some of the inmates sleep on the bunk beds provided, others sleep on the floor as the beds are inadequate. The babies are not accorded any special provisions such as baby-cots, infant food or clothing. In addition, lactating mothers neither get extra food nor supplementary diet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The standard diet for all prisoners in Zimbabwe comprises, breakfast -- coffee or tea with milk plus 1/8 of a loaf of bread, lunch -- sadza (maizemeal cake) and vegetables or beans and supper -- sadza and vegetables or beans. Pork is served four times a week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports say although the prison population had increased rapidly, in some cases almost doubling, food rations had not been increased proportionately. Prisons situated along borders experienced the biggest problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The unprecedented increases were mostly caused by border jumping into South Africa and Botswana and from Mozambique into Zambia and vice- versa. At Beitbridge Prison in the south-east near the border with South Africa, the number fluctuated between two and 200 new inmates on some days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Food in Zimbabwe's prisons is generally badly cooked, overcooked and cold because it is prepared long before it is actually eaten, says the CCJP report. For example, the preparation of breakfast commences at 4 am, yet the cells are opened at 6 am.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At Mutare Prison, the sadza which the researchers saw being dished out was cold and &quot;half cooked&quot; with maize-meal granules actually disintegrating in the plates. The spinach was of a greenish black or khaki colour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At Khami Maximum Prison in the south-west, near Zimbabwe's second city, Bulawayo, the nyimo (groundnuts) served with sadza were full of weevils. In fact, the weevils covered the entire top surface of the nuts such that it was only after a physical check that the researcher established what the relish was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nevertheless, the inmates were apparently nonchalant as none was observed removing the weevils. One inmate actually said: &quot;Ndiyo nyama yacho iyoyo&quot; (That is the meat).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such are the general standards in the older prisons. The new prisons like Chipinge and hopefully the New Mutare and Kadoma Prisons, have better cooking and dining facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An aspect of prison conditions that the CCJP researchers found most dehumanising was that of strip searches. Before the prisoners return to their cells, they were made to strip and thoroughly searched. During this exposure, other inmates stood watching. Only at Chipinge Prison was there a special shed built for this purpose to maintain the dignity of the individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main objective of the CCJP research was to examine and compare the legislation on which prison conditions and administration are based with the actual implementation of that legislation. The comparison is based on the concept of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Justice Anthony Gubbay, Zimbabwe's Chief Justice describes human rights as &quot;....claims which every individual has, or should have, upon the society in which she or he lives. To call them human rights suggests that they are universal, they are due to every human society. They do not differ with geography or history, culture or development. They do not depend on gender or race, class or status. To call them rights implies that they are claims as of right, not merely appeals to grace, charity or brotherhood or love; they need not be earned or deserved. They are more than aspirations or assertions of the good but claims, of entitlement and corresponding obligation in some political order under some applicable law, if only in a moral order under a moral law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When used carefully, human rights are not some abstract, inchoate good.  The rights are particular, defined and familiar, reflecting respect for individual dignity and a substantial autonomy, as well as a common sense of justice and injustice,&quot; says the Chief Justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CCJP report made recommendations to the Government based on its findings which encompass four broad categories of law reform, changes in the administration of the law, legal education and training and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Throughout the discussion on the findings, overcrowding in the prisons stood out as the cause for most of the other problems. It is recommended that the prison population be controlled by legislation which presents incarceration as a last resort. The proposed legislation should provide alternatives to imprisonment such as community service programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1993, the Zimbabwe government introduced a community service programme. By mid-1995 some 5,000 offenders had benefited from the process.  Rendering service to the community in exchange for jailing has also tremendously reduced overcrowding in the country's prisons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the Prisons Director, Mr. Langton Chigwida, speaking at a magistrates' Legal Forum in 1995 said: &quot;Prisons are expected to fulfill a number of roles for the community which at times appear to be contradictory depending on the climate of public opinion. In short, the task assigned to prisons by society is to turn society's rejects into model citizens. This is not an easy task.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Highlighting the advantages of the community service alternative, the CCJP report says the programme would be cheaper to run than conventional prisons and would also keep hardened criminals and first, young or non-violent offenders apart. It would also enable convicts with small sentences or even petty offenders to keep their jobs and continue to sustain their families. Experts here estimate that the average length of imprisonment on those given community service would have been three months at a monthly cost of Zimbabwe dollars 442 (US dollars 50). The 5,000 offenders who served in the programme have so far saved the government Zimbabwe dollars 6.6 million (US dollars 730,000).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CCJP report also argues that although the Prison Act of 1956 and the whole legal framework pertaining to the administration of Zimbabwe's prisons is in line with international standards, the system nevertheless, contains many wrongs which impede and perhaps render futile efforts at reformation.  The small, unhealthy cells, the bad odours, the vermin, the idleness, the brutality for instance, could almost be entirely eliminated by the engagement of officials and appropriately trained prison administrators.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cotonou - Feeling deeply insecure following his poor showing in the first round of Benin's Presidential elections on March 3, President Nicephore Soglo has postponed, by three days, the eagerly awaited second round of the voting, which will now take place on March 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the first round on March 3, none of the seven contenders managed an outright victory of the 51 per cent required to avoid a run-off. Both Soglo and his nearest rival, former military strongman, Mathieu Kerekou each received about 35 per cent of the votes cast. Kerekou trailed Soglo by a mere 20,000 votes out of the 1.5 million votes that were cast. In all, there are 2.5 million registered voters in Benin.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But election observers affiliated to Benin's Constitutional Court believe the irregularities in the elections were so widespread as to justify a nullification of the results. Among fraudulent practices noted, were under age voting and ballot stuffing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soglo, while announcing the three day postponement, said it was &quot;to redress the shortcomings noted on March 30.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The third runner-up to Soglo after Kerekou, was Adrien Houngbedji, former Speaker of the National Assembly. He obtained about 20 per cent of the votes and promptly announced he would back Kerekou's quest for the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Houngbedji's move is seen as quite upsetting to Soglo. There is now a very real likelihood of Kerekou returning to power after an absence of five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kerekou, 63, is a northerner and most northerners voted as a block for one of their own. Soglo, a southerner, was surprised by the large number of disenchanted southerners who voted for Kerekou, a former dictator with a poor human rights record, besides his Marxist policies that ruined the economy of tiny Benin in the 17 years that he ruled the country. He came to power in a coup in 1972.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soglo is widely credited with turning around the economic fortune of Benin through his World Bank/International Monetary Fund (IMF) supported reforms. Unfortunately Soglo has discovered that people do not eat statistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It became clear after the parliamentary elections of March 1995, that the honeymoon with people of Benin was over. He tried a few populist stratagies like making spiritism (voodoo) a national religion,. Although widely practised this move appears to have been of no political consequence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the former Marxist strongman, Kerekou, has indicated that he will overturn the World Bank reform programmes once elected. Many Beninois are impatient and prone to believe that they were better without the World Bank/IMF reform programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kerekou was driven out of office in 1989 after widespread disturbances during the &quot;wind of change&quot; that swept through many African countries in the late 80s and early 90s.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Professor Arthur Obel of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Nairobi and Director of the Kenya Biodiversity Centre here, has reiterated his claim that his self formulated drug called Pearl Omega made from herbal ingredients, is effective in the treatment of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even more controversially, he says the compound reversed the HIV status of seven patients out of 31 who have used it as per recommendations. He claims their HIV status changed from positive to negative. He says that a senior World Health Organisation (WHO) scientist/virologist, Dr. Tukei, was involved in the verification process.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On March 11, Prof. Obel, 54, a clinical pharmacologist by training, gave a well attended public talk on Pearl Omega, at the University of Nairobi School of Medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But fellow scholars and medical practitioners felt badly let down, not only because the facilities were completely inadequate but also because Prof.  Obel was deliberately frugal with information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most doctors were unimpressed by the small sample of patients and the methodology used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Professor William Lore of the Kenya Medical Association said: &quot;My colleague did not address any issues. He was more of a politician than a scientist - he must discuss his study design.&quot; Lore complained that Prof.  Obel did not follow the accepted norms in science and therefore, any claims, of efficiency remain largely unproven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prof. Obel has come under unprecedented criticism since he announced Pearl Omega through the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) party-owned Kenya Times on March 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi said that as far as the government was concerned &quot;no cure (for AIDS) had been discovered yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Intriguingly, Prof. Obel seems quite anxious about his personal security. When he prematurely excused himself and terminated his public lecture - at a point when discussions were getting heated, he drove away in a convoy, with a security car infront and at the rear of his self driven vehicle. Prof. Obel appears genuinely to believe that he is guarding very vital secrets.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maputo - A bill introduced in parliament by Mozambique's ruling FRELIMO party proposing that Islam's holy dates be recognised as national holidays in this southern African country just emerging from 16 years of civil war, has sparked political controversy and forced President Joaquim Chissano to intervene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chissano met with Christian representatives over the row on March 12 and urged dialogue between members of parliament from the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO) and those from the opposition Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO), who have opposed the proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Christian leaders, including the head of the Catholic Church, Cardinal Alexandre Maria Dos Santos, have met Chissano over the dispute which threatens to antagonise Christians and Muslims even before the healing of wounds inflicted by years of war, which pitted Chissano's FRELIMO government against the former RENAMO rebels led by Afonso Dhlakama.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aware of the Christians' discontent, the FRELIMO parliamentarians have also proposed that Holy Friday or Easter be a national holiday as well, a suggestion rejected by the Christians outright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> RENAMO, as expected, voted against the bill in February, but its few Muslim members voted with FRELIMO MPs who were in favour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government critics allege that economic interests are attached to FRELIMO's decision and pointed out that Mozambique recently joined the Arab Development Bank and the Islamic Organisation Conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers here said Mozambique's cash-strapped government decided to join the two organisations to win the favour of rich Gulf states from whom it expects rewards in the form of development aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Christianity and Islam are the country's two main religions, with Islam gaining ground in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But many of Mozambique's estimated 16 million people follow traditional beliefs, with an estimated five million Christians, four million Muslims and a small Hindu community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FRELIMO and RENAMO reached a peace pact that ended the war in 1992.  Elections in which FRELIMO emerged winner were held in October 1994.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Lawyers for jailed editors of Zambia's controversial bi-weekly, The Post, have expressed fears that the state security agents are planning to abduct the two journalists from jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The pair, Fred M'Membe (Editor-in-Chief) and Bright Mwape, the Managing Editor are currently serving an indefinite prison term for being found in contempt of parliament by the Speaker of the National Assembly Dr. Robinson Nabulyato, on February 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Windhoek (Namibia)-based Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA) in a press release dated March 12, quoted one of the editors' lawyers, Mr.  Sakwiba Sikota saying that he had information that undercover security agents were intending to carry out the abduction.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to MISA, Mr. Sikota said he had with him a letter dated March 6, addressed to the Officer-in-Charge of Lusaka Central Prison to prove his case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the MISA dispatch, Mr. Sikota had confirmed on March 11 that his office had &quot;reliable information&quot; that security agents had held discussions on how to abduct the editors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sikota said his office had since written to the prison officials asking them not to move the editors from their cells in the lawyers' absence, or without a valid warrant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the National Assembly has written to the Commissioner of Prisons in Lusaka and Kabwe, where M'Membe and Mwape are being held, confirming the arrest and imprisonment of the two editors. The letter, marked CONFIDENTIAL, partly reads: &quot;They will be held in custody until they show contrition or until such time that the National Assembly shall have reversed its decision (to jail the editors) upon motion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the letter advises that, &quot;only their (M'Membe and Mwape's) freedom of movement has been curtailed. They will continue to enjoy all other civil rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia's Home Affairs Minister Chitalu Sampa, was quoted early this month by the state-run media saying that M'Membe and Mwape &quot;should be treated like ordinary criminals&quot; while in Jail, and were not to receive preferential treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A prisoner is a prisoner and there is no special treatment,&quot; the Times of Zambia quoted the minister saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Post is well known for crusading investigative journalism. In 1994 as Managing Editor of the independent bi-weekly, M'Membe was summoned to give evidence in the trial of a minister who accused President Chiluba of drug trafficking, an allegation made at a press conference. M'Membe declined to testify since other newspapers were not summoned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier the same year, he was charged following the publication of controversial remarks by another minister who had quit his post.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Geneva - A comprehensive report, the &quot;Joint Evaluation of Emergency Assistance to Rwanda&quot;, undertaken by 19 donor governments, was released here on March 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Welcoming the report at a press conference here, the Steering Committee for Humanitarian Response (SCHR), made up of six of the world's biggest private humanitarian assistance organisations, describe the report into how the international community responded to the 1994/95 Rwandan crisis, as a &quot;lesson to be heeded by political leaders responsible for taking action against genocide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 19 donor governments that participated in the joint evaluation are Australia, Austria, Canada, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Germany, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Britain and the United States of America.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SCHR, which comprises Caritas Internationalis, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, International Save the Children Alliance, Lutheran World Federation, Oxfam and the World Council of Churches, called on donor governments to strengthen the United Nations conflict prevention and emergency coordination mechanisms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SCHR noted that such coordinating efforts in conflict prevention and response would help save thousands more lives in the event of another major humanitarian emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SCHR members however note that &quot;humanitarian action cannot substitute for political action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We, the churches and the private aid agencies cannot fill the vacuum caused when nation states refuse to take action to resolve political problems. There is not enough humanitarian aid in the world to do that,&quot; says Rev. Rudolf Hinz, Director of the Lutheran World Federation's Department for World Service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the SCHR members do not agree with the report's recommendations to merge all UN humanitarian agencies into one body. Instead, they call for the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA) to be strengthened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the report praises the aid effort, which dealt with a series of humanitarian crises of unprecedented scale, it criticises a few aid agencies whose performance was not up to the high standards of care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The rapid response of humanitarian aid agencies saved many lives when hundreds of thousands of people crossed borders in a matter of hours. But some agencies did not uphold professional standards of assistance. We urge all humanitarian agencies to subscribe to the SCHR and Red Cross Movement's Code of Conduct which affirms that all aid beneficiaries are treated with dignity and all aid agencies are held accountable to the beneficiaries as well as to the donors,&quot; says Rev. Myra Blyth of the World Council of Churches Unit on Sharing and Service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While welcoming the report and its recommendations, the agencies point out some crucial changes which need to be made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They call on governments and the UN to seriously consider the criticism that the UN Secretariat ignored its own early warning mechanisms before the genocide and reflect how best to ensure that such negligence does not happen again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The private agencies also emphasise that all non-governmental agencies should subscribe to the Code of Conduct developed by SCHR and the Red Cross Movement. NGO networks should be given greater capacity to monitor compliance with the Code. SCHR is planning to develop a series of professional and technical standards of performance to accompany the Code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, they urge donor governments to continue to support efforts to resolve problems in the Great Lakes region of Central Africa by supporting the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)'s seriously under-funded refugee programmes and working to resolve the painful crisis in neighouring Burundi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - South African President Nelson Mandela has rekindled debate about whether he is simply more tolerant to divergent opinions than most other world leaders or he is guilty of diplomatic bungling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Mandela caused outrage on March 6,when he said that while he had not been officially informed of an impending visit to South Africa by senior representatives of HAMAS, the Islamic fundamentalist group responsible for four recent suicide bombings that have killed over 60 people in Israel, he would be willing to meet with the organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South African Jewish Board of Deputies and the South African Zionist Federation wasted no time in condemning Mandela for his remarks: &quot;We are angry that these people whose hands are dripping with blood intend visiting our country. Indeed their terror deeds have been condemned by all, including our own government. We call on responsible politicians not to meet with these people,&quot; the two Jewish groups were reported saying.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports have been rife in South Africa that President Mandela planned to meet HAMAS in a bid to mediate for peace between this group, Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Israeli government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Mandela has not denied this assertion either. Although the elder statesman is on record as having condemned the HAMAS bombings &quot;in the strongest possible terms&quot; adding that &quot;violence does not help solve problems,&quot; he is also known for his open door policy of meeting just about anyone, regardless of their policies or world-wide acceptance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In February, President Mandela met with officials of the outlawed Algerian Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), which is said to be responsible for a reign of terror which has left over 40,000 people dead in this northern African country. Algeria is said to have been so outraged by the meetings that they were close to recalling their ambassador to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last year, a meeting between Mr. Mandela and Lybian strongman Muammar Gaddafi, a long time foe of Washington, is said to have upset the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> True to his &quot;open door&quot; policy, Mandela has also given audience to Gerry Adams, leader of the political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) Sinn Fein, much to the displeasure of the British government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commenting about the proposed meeting with the HAMAS leadership, Democratic Party leader in South Africa, Tony Leon, said South Africans were &quot;outraged by the idea of such a meeting: If the President believes that by meeting HAMAS he can change their views, he is sadly mistaken,&quot; Leon was reported saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;All he will do is further embarrass South Africa internationally and add fuel to the already existing suspicion that South Africa is not a responsible and reliable member of the international community,&quot; he concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela's &quot;open door&quot; policy in relation to the HAMAS has drawn varying reactions from other people. Mr. Jonathan Meidan of the Israeli Embassy in Nairobi told APS, &quot;as a free man and a president of a free country, Mandela is free to meet whoever he wishes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the other hand, the Second Secretary of the South African High Commission in Nairobi, Wielly H. Van Derwesthuizea said that if president Mandela were to meet HAMAS officials then the public should trust that he would do so for a noble cause. &quot;Israel cannot openly speak to HAMAS. It is safer for a neutral party, an outsider to mediate between all the parties concerned. It could be a way of getting the peace process on course yet once again,&quot; observed the diplomat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even as President Mandela's approach draws heated debate, his government is said to be making plans for an official visit by Cuban president Fidel Castro later in the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is expected not only to raise a lot of talk but also to cause a possible rift in the United States/South African relations, given the worsening US/Cuban relations, observers say.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lilongwe - A publisher of Christian books in Malawi is daring Bible scholars and writers in Africa to a special assignment -- that of writing more books.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Augustine Musopole, 47, a self-confessed born-again Christian, came to the helm of the Christian Literature Association in Malawi (CLAIM) on August 1 last year. His determination to challenge writers in Malawi and all over Africa is part of his multi-faceted plans to revamp the operations of CLAIM and make the organisation more relevant to the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is a great pity that Bible scholars and writers in Africa have not done much in terms of writing quality books on theology and Bible commentaries. CLAIM will now encourage these people to write. Apart from taking care of the local market, we are determined to sell some of the outstanding works overseas where there is a great demand for such books, particularly in some universities,&quot; he says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Musopole recently returned to Malawi after a 10-year educational and working stint in the United States of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Musopole says CLAIM plans to hold a series of national and regional workshops for writers to help induce people to turn to book writing. &quot;We hope non-governmental organisations and other well- wishers elsewhere in the world will co-operate with us in funding the workshops,&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An avid reader himself and an author of well-published essays, Musopole hopes CLAIM will live up to writers' expectations. &quot;The CLAIM mandate says the organisation should publish and sell books and I think we have over many years, failed in this aspect. I hope we will reset our targets and look well beyond Malawi's borders for our market,&quot; he notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the religious front, he sees potential in CLAIM publishing various books on theology, Bible commentaries, with some copies translated into several vernacular languages, Bible hand-books, tracts and other works aimed at assisting Gospel preachers to expound the Word of God better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the social level, Musopole talks of the need to publish more books on topics like family planning, parenting, struggles of growing-up, advice for youth and tips on education, including what to expect at universities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The list of possible titles is almost endless and I am sure if we put our act together, CLAIM can establish itself as a publisher of quality books which can be sought after even by readers overseas. But we first have to encourage the writers and modernise our publishing capacity,&quot; he states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CLAIM, which started operations in Malawi in the late 1960s, has published nearly 40 books and booklets the hard way -- by using manual type-writers and hiring the services of printing houses to do virtually all the work, from the keying-in of manuscripts to the final production stage.  The new CLAIM head is presently scouting around for desk-top publishing facilities for the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Musopole says he intends to encourage several writers to contribute chapters to a book for some works, while also letting those who can write books on their own do just that. &quot;I would be happy if in the near future CLAIM can be publishing up to 50 titles in a year: that could be a good start,&quot; he enthuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new CLAIM chief says he hopes to propose the introduction of a &quot;Reading Week&quot; or a &quot;Reading Month&quot;, when the general public -- particularly school and college going youth can be challenged to read an entire book.  &quot;CLAIM will be suggesting some books to read, for those who need prompting...because the idea is to promote the book- reading discipline, for knowledge is power,&quot; he declares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A self-confessed book-worm who says he reads and works to just over midnight everyday, Dr. Musopole has now challenged his entire CLAIM staff of 60 to read widely. &quot;I have encouraged every member of staff -- from the watchman (security guard) to the top-most person in the organisation -- to be reading, for this will be one of the determining factors for promotion; I cannot see how people (staff) can be in a book trade and yet not read,&quot; he says firmly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CLAIM General Manager explains that he has been talking to his staff on a one-on-one basis and also consulting leaders from churches and Christian organisations on how CLAIM can interact with them better. &quot;I have been talking to the staff to see where and how I can try and motivate them in our new determination to make CLAIM a more forward-looking organisation,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many CLAIM members of staff and some observers in Christian circles in Malawi welcome Dr. Musopole's emergence in the new post as a blessing that will go well beyond the CLAIM ministry, especially if he can translate his clear-cut if not revolutionary ideas into reality.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - Government officials in Nigeria's central Kwara State have closed down three private Christian secondary schools in the state capital, Ilorin, accusing them of failing to provide Islamic religious courses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an official communication dated March 4, the state Ministry of Education withdrew temporary approval given in January to the three new schools in the state capital, because of what it described as their &quot;deliberate violation of the relevant provisions of the provisional approval letter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The state authorities insisted that the schools should provide for lessons in the Islamic religion and recruit qualified teachers for the subject.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The closure of the schools effectively blocked the chances of pupils in one of the schools to enrol for Junior Secondary School Certificate examinations scheduled for later this year, according to local press reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The schools will remain closed for the next six months and will be re-opened after they reapply for approval, according to conditions set by the government when the schools were allowed to commence operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Armed policemen were on March 5 deployed to the schools to chase away students and teachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kwara State is predominantly Muslim and the head of the State Education Ministry, Halimat Ajoke Yusuf, is a Muslim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chairman of the state branch of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Bishop Kolawole Solanke, described the government action as &quot;simply too bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CAN had in February threatened to resist any attempt by government to impose the Islamic religion on the schools, which were founded and funded by churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In another development, Nigeria's military government has issued a decree imposing a five-year jail term for any person or group convicted of involvement in an attempt to sabotage the military government's transition programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No option of a fine would be granted anyone found guilty under the Transition to Civil Rule (Political Programme) Decree number one of 1936, signed January 5 by military ruler General Sani Abacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tribunal, whose chairman shall be a serving or retired senior judge, would also include a member of the armed forces, according to the decree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The transition programme announced last October 1 by Abacha is scheduled to culminate on October 1, 1998 in the military handing over power to an elected civilian president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The municipal elections, scheduled for between March 16 and 25, are an important component of the programme. They will be held nationwide on a &quot;no-party basis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposition National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) and human rights organisations in Nigeria have called for a boycott of the elections, describing them as an irrelevant waste of time and money.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York - The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a nonpartisan advocate for press freedom, today condemned the banning of the Internet and printed editions of Zambia's leading independent newspaper, &quot;The Post,&quot; and protests the continued legal harassment of the daily's editorial staff, including CPJ's 1995 International Press Freedom Award winner, managing director and editor in chief Fred M'membe, the latest of which has forced M'membe and his colleagues to turn themselves in after ten days in hiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The suppression of the printed and electronic editions of The Post and the continued legal harassment of editor Fred M'membe and his colleagues call into question the Zambian government's proclaimed commitment to democracy,&quot; said CPJ's Executive Director, William Orme. &quot;The censorship of independent news reporting is especially troubling during an election year, when Zambians rely on news organizations such as &quot;The Post&quot; for information about opposition viewpoints and government actions and policies.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CPJ denounces the following incidents of detention without trial, censorship and the protracted legal harassment of the &quot;The Post&quot;'s editorial staff:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * The February 5 issue of &quot;The Post,&quot; which revealed the Zambian government's plan to hold a referendum in March to promulgate a controversial draft constitution, was banned by presidential decree and declared a &quot;prohibited publication&quot; under Section 53 of the Penal Code. The decree also warned the public that any citizen caught in possession of the edition, including the on-line version, could be charged with committing a criminal offense under the Prohibited Publications Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * M'membe, managing editor Bright Mwape and special projects editor Masautso Phiri were arrested on Feb. 6 and charged with possessing state secrets, a violation of Section 4 of the State Security Act, and possessing a banned publication. The three were released on bail of US$350 each on Feb. 7, the same day that President Chiluba ordered the removal of the February 5 edition from &quot;The Post&quot;'s World Wide Web site. President Chiluba's decree marks the first act of censorship of the internet on the African continent.  If convicted, M'membe, Phiri and Mwape face a maximum of 25 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * In a separate incident, on February 23, M'membe, Mwape and columnist Lucy Banda Sichone, went into hiding to avoid imprisonment on charges of contempt of Parliament after the Zambian National Assembly, on February 21, found the three journalists guilty of violating the Powers and Privileges Act. The Act is a colonial law which prohibits non-members of parliament from criticizing proclamations issued by members of parliament. In the January 29 edition of &quot;The Post,&quot; M'membe, Mwape and Sichone had written articles commenting on the vice president's criticism, in parliament, of a recent Supreme Court decision. The National Assembly Standing Orders Committee sentenced the three journalists to indefinite detention until they publicly apologized for breach of Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * On March 4, M'membe and Mwape surrendered to parliamentary authorities, explaining that they would not apologize to the House. M'membe pleaded with the speaker of the National Assembly to absolve Sichone, who remains in hiding with her three-month-old infant, of blame. Attorneys for &quot;The Post&quot; have petitioned the High Court, challenging the constitutionality of the National Assembly Powers and Privileges Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As reported in CPJ's annual report, &quot;Attacks on the Press in 1995&quot;: &quot;After a promising start, President Frederick Chiluba's government reneged on its promises to reform repressive legislation. Instead, it embarked on a deliberate campaign to restrict press freedom and is rapidly becoming one of the worst violators of press freedom in southern Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since its launch in 1991, &quot;The Post&quot; has endured military raids, censorship, arrests and numerous legal actions sanctioned by President Chiluba's government. For their exposure of government corruption, the journalists face countless charges, including defamation of the president, which amount to more than 125 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CPJ has initiated a campaign to bring world attention to this pattern of harassment of the Zambian independent press and to urge President Chiluba to ensure an environment in which Zambian journalists can work freely. We encourage all those interested in participating to sign the attached letter to President Chiluba, then mail or fax it to CPJ. CPJ will forward the protest letters to the State House in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CPJ applauds the &quot;World Press Review&quot;'s recent choice of Fred M'membe as co-winner of the magazine's 1995 International Editor of the Year Award. The award is given annually to editors working outside the United States, honoring &quot;enterprise, courage, and leadership in advancing the freedom and responsibility of the press, enhancing human rights, and fostering excellence in journalism.&quot; M'membe shares the award with Dapo Olorunyomi, editor in chief of &quot;TheNEWS,&quot; a Lagos-based news magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (For up-to-date information on the state of the media worldwide, and CPJ's activities and publications, visit CPJ's World Wide Web site at http://www.cpj.org.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> **********</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His Excellency President Frederick Chiluba President of the Republic of Zambia State House Independence Avenue P. O. Box 30208 Lusaka, ZAMBIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Your Excellency,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As an advocate of press freedom, I write to express my concern over the persecution of the staff of your country's leading independent daily newspaper, &quot;The Post.&quot; Managing director and editor in chief Fred M'membe and his colleagues, managing editor Bright Mwape, special projects editor Masautso Phiri and columnist Lucy Sichone, have endured relentless harassment and an unprecedented number of legal charges since the newspaper was launched in 1991. For exercising their rights as journalists to freely express ideas and opinions, M'membe, a winner of three international press freedom awards, and his colleagues face countless charges which amount to more than 125 years in jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More recently, on March 4, M'membe and Mwape surrendered to parliamentary authorities after spending 10 days in hiding to avoid imprisonment on charges of contempt of parliament. They were sentenced by the National Assembly Standing Orders Committee which convicted the journalists, without trial in a court of law, under the National Assembly Powers and Privileges Act. They are now serving an indefinite prison sentence. Sichone, who was also convicted with M'membe and Mwape, remains in hiding with her three-month-old infant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Furthermore, M'membe, Mwape and Phiri are facing charges of violating Section 4 of the State Security Act, the conviction of which has a jail sentence of 25 years, in connection with the banned printed and on-line editions of &quot;The Post,&quot; which Your Excellency decreed a &quot;prohibited publication.&quot; This decree marks the first act of censorship of the Internet on the African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I strongly urge Your Excellency to annul the convictions of the three journalists, and to immediately and unconditionally release M'membe and Mwape. I also urge you to revoke the ban on the February 5 edition of &quot;The Post,&quot; and to revoke the colonial National Assembly Powers and Privileges Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, I call on Your Excellency, in this election year, to intervene on the side of press freedom, and to uphold your public proclamations of support for a free and independent press by ensuring an environment in which journalists may work and safely.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We want to start preparations as soon as possible,&quot; said Kennedy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He explained that the delay in releasing the report was because the last part of the report was yet to be received from the manufacturers of the military plane that carried 30 soccer players and officials when it plunged into the Atlantic Ocean.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The report took time because some parts of the aircraft had to be fished out of the sea,&quot; Chiluba said, adding: &quot;Certain aspects of the report are already in place but we can't reveal the contents in the first report in the absence of the other report.&quot; He said the remaining report &quot;mentions certain things that could have caused the accident.&quot; &quot;Until the two reports are in place, we can't release the report,&quot; Chiluba said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Anglo American Corporation (AAC) is still trying to bring together an international consortium to finance the development of the $600 million (K600 billion) Konkola Deep Mining Project (KDMP) on the Copperbelt, a company spokesman has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Negotiations are continuing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, I can not tell you how far we are in reaching an agreement,&quot; AAC (Central Africa) managing director Anderson Mazoka said last week Friday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The company signed an agreement with the Zambian government in January this year giving it the go ahead to find investors willing to invest in the mine seen as the key to the survival of the copper mining industry in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Copper still earns about 90 per cent of of the country's foreign exchange annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And talks began in London the same month after the agreement was signed but little has been said about the progress made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We can not disclose details of negotiations,&quot; Mazoka said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a statement from Jack Holmes, leader of the Anglo American delegation on January 23 said the consortium would &quot;seek to conclude agreements with government and ZCCM and will review and refine the KDMP feasibility study to a satisfactory level of confidence for a financing decision.&quot; He said feasibility studies indicated that the project was viable but &quot;subject to further technical evaluations and the resolution of other important issues including an internationally competitive tax protocol.&quot; And finance minister Ronald Penza in his budget address last month reiterated the government's commitment to the success of the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Negotiations between Anglo-American and the government have started,&quot; Penza said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Both sides are fully committed to moving the project forward as rapidly as possible.&quot;<BR> No.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 429, THURSDAY EDITION, MARCH 14, 1996 -FTJ won't give in to pressure By Goodson Machona THE government will not succumb to calls by opposition parties and civic organisations to adopt the new republican constitution by a constituent assembly, president Chiluba has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He ticked off the donor community and foreign governments who have hinted that further aid would depend on good governance and the rule of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They should deal with us on the basis of partnership knowing that we are a sovereign independent state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I ask of you that we have had enough lessons on how countries evolve their own constitutions,&quot; Chiluba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at a press conference yesterday, Chiluba said there was no need for a constituent assembly because the composition of the Mwanakatwe constitution review commission was reflective of the character of the Zambian people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We had chiefs, non governmental organisations, churches and political parties because we didn't want to be accused of having doctored the constitution,&quot; Chiluba said, adding: &quot;Those who meet in conventions talking about a constituent assembly, we say enjoy your time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But my government will not capitulate or surrender its authority and power by calling for a constituent assembly.&quot; He said calling for a constituent assembly is like creating parliament by default.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Having appointed a cross section of people who went round and gathered evidence, what will be the role of the constituent assembly?&quot; Chiluba asked, adding: &quot;What the people have said is already in the document (the Mwanakatwe report).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those people calling for a constituent assembly have other designs in their mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - About K1 billion has been raised from the sale of strategic maize reserves since the exercise began three weeks ago an official from the agricultural commodities exchange (ACE) said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Manager of ACE, Andrew Fletcher, said in an interview on Friday, however, that the recent political controversy over the price of mealie meal had reduced the demand by half.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Sales have declined,&quot; Fletcher said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Bids have dropped by 50 per cent.&quot; He said apart from the wrangling over the price of mealie-meal, the maize market appears to have peaked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The downward pressure on prices is squeezing millers who are now reluctant to buy the maize now,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A recent report from the Agricultural Marketing Information Centre of the Ministry of Agriculture said bids for the maize in strategic reserves had declined to 25 totaling 1010 tonnes last week from 66 totaling 3940 tonnes in the second week and 113 totaling 3140 tonnes in the first week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports that a Copperbelt miller was offering breakfast meal at K11,000 per 25 kg bag appears to have disturbed the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Genuine maize traders and millers have stopped buying maize for the time being,&quot; the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Those about to import maize and or mealie meal have put their bids on hold because one can not compete with such a low price for breakfast meal.&quot; Fletcher advised politicians to allow market forces to work because trying to keep prices for consumers low now would logically require the government to support farmers when the price of local maize drops later in the season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If we subsidise consumption when the price is high will it mean that when prices are low the farmers will be subsidised?&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Thursday, agriculture deputy minister Mathias Mpande advised politicians to stop interfering in the market because this was undermining the confidence of traders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My minister and I have worked hard to give confidence to the private sector and if they stopped participating in the maize market shortages could result in prices going as high as K30,000,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia National Farmers Union president Ben Kapita also criticised politicians over their recent utterances because they amounted to hypocrisy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This government has never kept maize prices from falling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When farmers faced ruin in 1993 they were given promissory notes instead of a good maize price,&quot; Kapita said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But when prices rise it appears that farmers will not be allowed to benefit.&quot; Fletcher earlier said the controversy had created uncertainty in the maize market but he was confident it would settle down later.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - After ten days of deliberations, the 'Concerned Citizens' have vowed not to vote for any member of parliament who does not support the adoption of the republican constitution through a Constituent Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One participant, Lee Habasonda, advised other delegates to campaign against any members of parliament who are opposed to a Constituent Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We should not allow ourselves to be manipulated by these politicians.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We should still insist that we adopt our constitution through a Constituent Assembly if the views of the people are to be reflected,&quot; Habasonda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most delegates felt a Constituent Assembly be organised despite the government's opposition and disregard of the debates on the Mwanakatwe Draft Constitution by presenting the Amendment Bill to Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In 1991 we fought against that monster of dictatorship and now we have to fight that monster of total injustice to liberate ourselves from this bondage.&quot; &quot;In 1991 there was an uprising against the UNIP government by every Zambian, we need another uprising against these men who are taking our country backwards,&quot; the participants said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Daniel Lisulo also asked the participants to work out possible measures should government refuse to listen to the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We should make sure that the 'Green Paper' that will be prepared should reflect the true views of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And after this we should make sure we publicise it so that people can compare it with the government white paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 'Green paper' should be outstanding from the white paper,&quot; Lisulo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John Mfula who travelled from Kasama said they should make it clear that the ruling MMD succumbs to their demands over the constitituion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Lets show them that if they fail to listen to our demands, we should make it very clear when they come to us to ask for a vote,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 'Green Paper' will be handed to the President, the Chief Justice and the speaker of the National Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week foreign affairs minister Christon Tembo was reported to have assured South Africa foreign minister Alfred Nzo who is currently in the country that government would consider some of the 'reasonable' proposals from the 'Citizen Convention'.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Former finance minister Luke Mwananshiku has been appointed to chair the ZCCM board to make sure operations are smooth before the privatisation of the mining conglomerate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Chiluba announced yesterday at a State House press conference that Mwananshiku and two other independent board members had been appointed to the board to streamlime operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The decline of ZCCM is really a worrying issue and government is doing something to ensure that all is well by the time it is privatised,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba said that proper management was crucial in the running of ZCCM affairs if things were to move accordingly before privitisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On its privatisation, he said the whole programme was on course but he could not indicate the time frame within which the exercise would be concluded. And Chiluba has said that his government has performed well on the economic front since it came into power and asked people to give it another mandate to complete its programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The MMD had proved to be a responsible government which had established and mantained staunch relations with both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said government has been serious about reform and that it would take a lot of time before some of the fruits of the current government could be realised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The government has been particular and concerned about reforms, which has caused a lot of suffering for the ordinary people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it should be realised that it is a long road to cover,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the increase of mealie-meal prices, the President accused some farmers of using the maize issue to generate dissent against government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was being parochial, he said, for farmers to tell politicians to stop talking about maize and mealie meal price when people's lives were being affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These people are being parochial by telling us not to talk about maize and mealie meal price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Politics in Africa are about food and shelter, how can we stop talking about it?&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The National Party (NP) has condemned the draft constitutional bill empowering the President to dismiss Supreme and High Court judges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NP spokesman, Sam Chipungu, said in an interview yesterday that the hasty publication of the bill has put the independence of the judiciary at stake.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chipungu said the problem started when the bill for the conditions of service for the judges was passed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If the President has powers of giving judges conditions of service, what can stop him from firing them?&quot; Chipungu asked, adding, &quot;We condemn this article because it undermines the independence of the judiciary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The article may look innocent on the surface of it, but it is very serious in reality,&quot; Chipungu carped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And NP Legal chairman Ludwig Sondashi said the amendment cannot be accepted in a civilised society as it greatly violates the independence of the judiciary by insisting to know the reason why the judge acted in the manner he did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The article can only be effected by a primitive government such as ours as is proving to be,&quot; Sondashi said, adding,&quot;the MMD should also know that they will not stay in power forever, the same article they are effecting today will work against them tomorrow.&quot; Chipungu further condemned the recalling of retired judges to the bench and described them as 'client judges'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If a recalled retired judge is handling a sensetive political case, what will stop him from being on the realms of the executive?&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said President Chiluba wants to take full control of the judiciary so that it could be easier to overturn the judges decisions in some cases like they have done to the landmark Supreme Court judgment by the Chief Justice Matthew Ngulube on the Public Order Act.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Opposition parties and human rights organisations have reacted sharply to an article in the draft constitutional bill empowering the President to dismiss Supreme or High Court judges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Section 98(3) grants the President power to remove a judge from office subject to ratification by the National Assembly, for gross misconduct which 98 (5) defines as: &quot;the taking into account of extraneous considerations whether political, personal or otherwise, which have the effect of causing gross misapplication or misinterpretation of the law resulting in gross injustice to an individual or the state or to the general public welfare and good governance.&quot; Liberal Progress Front secretary Rolf Shenton charged that the whole constitution was a &quot;fraud&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't want to discuss any part of the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The whole thing is just a fraud which is just being imposed on the people,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Legal Resources Foundation(LRF) charged that the clause was meant to undermine the judiciary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is no law anywhere where a judge can be removed for misinterpreting the law, this is completely against the legal principles,&quot; LRF legal officer Robby Shabwanga said,&quot; adding: &quot;This shows how intolerant the government is towards calls for an independent judiciary.&quot; But efforts to get a comment from the government officials failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vice President Godfrey Miyanda, chief government spokesman Amusaa Mwanamwambwa and Home Affairs Minister Chitalu Sampa were all said to be out of Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Zambia Democratic Congress(ZDC) Vice-President Kasuka Mutukwa said the &quot;the constitutional making process had a totally punitive approach and should be rejected by the people&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This clause specifically targeted at the judiciary clearly shows that the MMD government would like to have a free hand to tamper with the independence of the judiciary,&quot; Mutukwa said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National Party secretary general Akashambatwa Mbikusita Lewanika said the MMD government had personalised the constitutional process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This shows the personalised partisan position from the government in trying to intimidate the bench into making decisions in line with their political considerations,&quot; Lewanika said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But CHAKA party president Jairus Kalisilira suggested that the independence of the judiciary can only be maintained if the existing parliamentary system is changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What we need is to have an upper and lower house system of parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Appointments should be done by the upper house so that the President becomes a complete servant of the people,&quot; Kalisilira said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - British Petroleum (Zambia) managing director, Roger Griffiths, has said the sale of the company may be concluded with the Zambia Privatisation Agency within two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The heads of agreement has been reached and the sales agreement may be finalised in the next month or two,&quot; he said at a press briefing on Monday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the 51 per cent government shares would be floated to the public by the Zambia Privatisation Trust Fund to enable Zambians buy shares in the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Griffiths also said that he would like BP shares listed on the Lusaka Stock Exchange to benefit from the five per cent reduction in corporate tax given to companies so listed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It would be part of the negotiating stance, we would be interested in that,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The February 28 privatisation status report says BP had acquired 25 per cent shares in BP Zambia for $3.2 million (K3.2 billion) under its pre-emptive rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And visiting BP Southern Africa and BP Africa chief executive Fred Phaswana said BP employees would be able to own shares in BP International once BP Zambia was privatised because of the company's employee share scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He reaffirmed that BP was here to stay and as proof of this, the company has budgeted US $2 million annually for infrastructure development such as filling stations, storage depots for customers and other facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Phaswana ruled out the possibility of BP and Mobil merging in Zambia like they have done in Europe because conditions here were different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The BP and Mobil merger in Europe was dictated by conditions in Europe,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't see those circumstances here.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The University of Zambia Political, Social and Economic Debate Association (UNZAPOSED) has been banned for one year for issuing a press statement against the sentencing of The Post editors by the speaker of National Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The banning of UNZAPOSED, which was announced by the dean of students last Thursday, came after the University of Zambia Students Union (UNZASU) complained to the dean that the association had violated the affiliation regulations by issuing a statement without consulting it as the mother body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We recommended to the dean of students affairs to have UNZAPOSED banned because its executive ignored the regulation which stipulates that all clubs at the campus can only issue press statements through or after consulting UNZASU,&quot; UNZASU secretary general Chungu Malitonga said in an interview last Thursday, adding: &quot;But this is not about what the club said but the kind of way the statement was issued.&quot; UNZAPOSED President Henry Malikyama last Tuesday condemned the move by the speaker of the National Assembly Robinson Nabulyato to jail indefinitely managing director and editor-in-chief Fred M'membe, managing editor Bright Mwape and columnist Lucy Sichone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He demanded the immediate lifting of the sentence unconditionally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the banning has been condemned by UNZAPOSED.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The punishment is too much on us,&quot; Malikyama complained in an interview on Thursday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We did not speak on behalf of all the students so it is very unfair to ban the club.&quot; The association was banned on the day it was supposed to hold a debate with political leaders from the ruling MMD and opposition parties on the &quot;Public Order Act amendment versus Constitutional liberties&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The banning of UNZAPOSED is very unfortunate because academic freedom of expression which exists at UNZA has grossly been done away with,&quot; senior student Namakando Sumbwa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ban almost caused confusion at UNZA on Thursday evening and students who wanted to attend the debate immediately demanded the impeachment of the entire UNZASU executive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNZASU president Emmanuel Tembo is expected to hold a press conference sometime this week to discuss the students' position on the mode of adoption of the constitution, the arrest of Post editors, UNZASU's role in the forthcoming general elections and other important national issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNZASU publicity secretary Brian Mulenga confirmed the press conference in a notice to students released on Friday, but no date has been set.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The United States (US) government is keenly monitoring the current democratisation process taking place in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Visiting US principal deputy assistant secretary for African affairs, Prudence Bushnell, said during a press briefing in Lusaka yesterday that her visit was aimed at consolidating democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We saw the first democratic elections in Zambia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But what is important is not the elections but what comes afterwards in the consolidation of this democracy,&quot; Bushnell said, adding: &quot;The second elections are also important because when you talk about democracy you do not only talk about specific insitutions, but also the underpinnings to it like freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, corruption and need for transparency,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bushnell also disclosed that the question of the two detained Post editors was discussed during the talks with President Chiluba but could not give further details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That was one of the issues we discussed but I was informed that they were jailed on a parliamentary law of this country, and I accept that,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She also called on both the government and the opposition parties to promote a culture of democracy which she said could only be created by parliament, government, the press and the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The government has a responsibility to apply laws fairly and listen to all citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposition has a responsibility to make their programmes known to their citizens and the press has also got a responsibilty to report truthfully without exageration,&quot; Bushnell said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition parties and other interested groups recently called on the donor community to impose sanctions on Zambia, but Bushnell warned that the consequences of sanctions would be adverse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I held discussions with various leaders of opposition parties but none of them brought up the issue of sanctions, but I wish to say that the impact of the results go beyond what you may want to achieve,&quot; warned Bushnell, adding: &quot;So that if you want to impose economic sanctions they must be well targeted.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Zambia Association of Manufacturers (ZAM) has urged the government to review its decision to classify some inputs as finished goods, thereby attracting duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZAM Vice-chairman, Anthony Simmonds, said in an interview yesterday that government's move defeated finance minister Ronald Penza's recent budget announcement that duty on manufacturing raw materials would be reduced to 5 per cent from 20 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The government gave certain reductions in tariffs for manufacturing raw materials.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the ministry of finance and Zambia Revenue Authority have redefined some previously regarded as manufacturing inputs as finished goods and the duty has gone up,&quot; Simmonds said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He gave examples of bearings and wire used in the manufacture of goods for the mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Both to a certain extent are finished products,&quot; he admitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But if they are used to manufacture other items they are raw materials.&quot; Simmonds said the measure was annoying because manufacturers expected duty rates to fall instead of rising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The major effect has been to move the duty from 20 to 25 per cent in many cases instead of down to 5 per cent,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And acting ZRA public relations officer Nkweto Tembwe confirmed that discussions had taken place between ZAM, ZRA and the ministry of finance on the complaints raised by the manufacturers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The difficulty is that what one manufacturer considers a raw material is not necessarily a raw material as defined by the very comprehensive customs tariff code,&quot; Tembwe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, he said as a result of lobbying and political representations, some adjustments have been made to the tariffs in the committee stage of the Customs Amendment Bill presented to parliament in the last session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tembwe said further adjustments could be made by way of statutory instruments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finance minister Ronald Penza said in his budget address in January that duty on raw materials and productive machinery was being reduced from 20 per cent to 5 per cent and on intermediate goods from 30 per cent to 15 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the measure was meant to remove tariff anomalies and improve competitiveness of Zambia's producers relative to those in the sub region</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Field registration supervisor for Lusaka, George Phiri disclosed this in an interview on Monday but could not give details.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have been directed by the director of elections to inform you to be on stand-by as the case will be coming up in court soon,&quot;JPhiri said without disclosing the date of the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - As the Kwacha continues to depreciate, there are growing calls among the business houses and some economists to re-introduce controls on the foreign exchange rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia Education Publising House managing director, Henry Chipewo, says there is need to introduce some form of control on the ever soaring exhange rates. He called for a fixed exchange rate by the central bank which he felt was more appropriate to the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A flexible fixed exchange rate is more desirable in Zambia,&quot; Chipewo observed, explaining: &quot;The Bank of Zambia should have a duty of closely studying the behaviour of macro-economic factors and simply make timely adjustments than is the case now where everything is just let loose without any control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that the current Kwacha devaluation at the expense of the liberalised exchange rate controls had only inflicted poverty on citizens as Zambia's core export copper was subjected to low prices and felt that these kind of scenario was only workable in industrialised countries like Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Zambia at the moment produces nothing that should induce natural devaluation of the Kwacha to create any competitive edge against anyone,&quot; he said adding that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If anything, devaluation has only enabled us to inflict more poverty on our selves by selling more copper for less money in real terms and more over whatever we export is for peanuts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Chipewo's suggestions were quickly shot down by Central Bank spokesman, Kabinga Pande last Friday, who felt introducing such controls was going back to the old system of governing economic affairs which inhibited economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't think that would be the best thing to do as it would be like going back to the old system of running economic affairs,&quot;JPande said but declined to further comment on the matter but promised to issue a detailed statement later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pande's sentiments were supported by former Bankers Association of Zambia chairman and managing director of Barclays Bank Zambia Limited, Michael McNie who termed the calls for exchange controls as &quot;appalling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It would be appalling to go back to the exchange control system. We've got a liberalised economy and a free market economy, what should just be worked out to halt further devaluation of the Kwacha is a proper management of the economy,&quot; McNie observed, adding:J&quot;Even if we went back to the old system the value of the Kwacha would still continue to fall with the high inflation in the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - YOUTHS have asked the President to ensure the Youth Constituency Funds launched last year was not politicised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The message was delivered to President Frederick Chiluba by Lenganji Namumba, a grade 12 pupil of Matero girls secondary in Lusaka. She also called for the funds to be unblocked from the current bureaucratic systems of disbursement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We would like you to ensure that the fund and the youth enterprises revolving fund are not held up in local government and political bureaucratic procedures,&quot; Namumba said, adding: &quot;Local government institutions have also become political rather than service to the communities where they belong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his speech President Chiluba said the youths were a major resource of output who should take full responsibility to participate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The youth consist of a major resource of output in this country and the economy will only be successful if each and everyone of you embraces the responsibilty to fully participate,&quot; Chiluba said, and he disclosed: &quot;Government has increased the allocation of the youth enterprises revolving fund and will keep increasing when the budget allows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also promised that the issue of constituency funds would be addressed and that the youths were free to give their views on their use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We shall ensure that the disbursement of the fund is not subjected to partisanism. You should also be free to express critical views on how the fund is progressing,&quot; Chiluba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The youth week reached a climax with hundreds of youths attending a wreath laying ceremony officiated by President Chiluba at the Freedom statue in Lusaka yesterday to mark the end of the celebrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba disclosed at the same function that 70 per cent of the Zambian population were below the age of thirty.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - PRESIDENT Frederick Chiluba has dissociated himself and his government from the decision to include the citizenship clause which will bar former president Kenneth Kaunda from contesting the forthcoming elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Nothing can be further from the truth. That is totally false. Our constitution shall not be tailored around one man,&quot; Chiluba told a State House press conference yesterday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Kaunda described Chiluba's performance at the press conference as &quot;dishonest&quot; and nothing of importance except &quot;play acting&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You cannot play act on important issues such as a constitution of a country. The constitution of the Republic is a sacred document and it must be treated as such,&quot; Kaunda said in an interview yesterday. UNIP will hold a press conference on Sunday, he said and added: &quot;To say the least it is a sad thing to have a head of state who is dishonest with himself and the nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberal Progressive Front secretary Rolf Shenton described Chiluba's performance as &quot;nothing new&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have heard nothing new from President Chiluba for the past four years. It is sad that he is not prepared to listen when the country is crying out for compromise. All he is talking about is power because that is what he has and he is not prepared to listen,&quot; Shenton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the press conference yesterday Chiluba claimed the clause in the Mwanakatwe draft constitution which bars people whose parents are not Zambians from standing as Republican Presidents was included by the Mwanakatwe constitutional review commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also claimed that the Mwanakatwe commission concluded its work long before Kaunda announced his return to politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Kaunda could not have been a factor in this report because just before the commission commenced work our dear Kenneth Kaunda announced his retirement from politics,&quot; Chiluba said, adding: &quot;He did not come back until the commission had collected all the evidence. I would like to know how he could have been a factor while he was in retirement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this is disputed by both Kaunda and his press assistant Muhabi Lungu who is a former staunch MMD supporter. Lungu said Kaunda made known his intentions to return to politics long before Mwanakatwe made his report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is a deliberate lie by Chiluba, a deliberate manipulation of facts,&quot; said Lungu who also said that by the time Sikota Wina was making the MMD submission to the commission Kaunda had already completed his tour of the country. &quot;President Chiluba is lying,&quot; Lungu insisted yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Kaunda described as &quot;criminal&quot; Chiluba's inclusion in the draft constitutional bill of a clause which will give him power to dismiss judges of the Supreme and High courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is one of the criminal acts by this president and his government.  Today judges are under pressure, what type of democracy is that - to intimidate judges? That is not done by any democrat,&quot; Kaunda said, adding: &quot;It demonstrates the type of man he is. A man who thinks like that is a dictator of the worst kind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda, who described his relationship with Chiluba as far from being cordial as the President claimed, also charged that Chiluba should take his hands off the judges because his actions &quot;will bring bloodshed to Zambia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It shows the man is sick. The relationship is nasty. The last time he talked to me on the phone he literally insulted me,&quot; Kaunda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both Kaunda and his press assistant insisted that the former president would contest this year's elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He will stand no matter what they do,&quot; Lungu said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Nothing will stop me from contesting the presidency of this country, I have come to lead this country into second liberation and I will do it,&quot; Kaunda said at a rally a week ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Chiluba says Kaunda will only stand &quot;if the law does not define or prescribe&quot; what it says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When the constitution says this is the position, that is the position everyone follows,&quot; Chiluba declared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The clause has been a contentious issue ever since the government white paper was released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week &quot;concerned citizens&quot; drawn from various political parties, NGOs and other interested parties met at Lusaka's Mulungushi conference centre where they unanimously agreed that anyone can stand as Republican President as long as he or she was Zambian.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - A LOSING candidate at the Zambia Basketball Association elections held last Saturday has attributed his defeat to a smear campaign by his club chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anderson Nyembe, who was highly-tipped for the job, charged that Lusaka City Council (LCC) Looters chairman, Wesly Katepu played tricks against him.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Just before the voting started as contesting persons, we were asked to leave the room but shortly after we left , Katepu lied to the out-going chairman , Brian Chisengalumbwe, that all people that had nominated me were not representatives of the clubs. But what even surprised me was that voting went on even after that without informing me. I think it would be fair for Katepu to stop personal vendettas, he won't develop sport like this,&quot; observed Nyembe in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nyembe was nominated by Willy Chama of Roan and Lottie Zulu of LCC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the former LCC Looters and national team trainer, Nyembe maintained that he will still continue working with the new executive despite losing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am not bitter and I will now try all I can to help where I can. My plans are that basketball should be re-orgainsed in schools before concentration on higher levels,&quot; said Nyembe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaonga polled 9 votes to emerge as the new chief for the assocaition while Davy Katete was second with six votes in a three-man contest which saw Nyenbe getting no votes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - NIKUV Computers is not a registered company in Zambia, the Lusaka High Court was told yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deputy Registrar of Companies in the ministry of commerce George Lipimile told High Court Commissioner Bornaventure Mutale that according to a search conducted last Friday, Nikuv was not registered to operate in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;From the search we conducted last Friday (February 8, 1996) in both local and foreign registers, the company that was stated on the summons, Nikuv Computers Israel Limited, is not registered,&quot; Lipimile said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The revelations came during the continued trial in the case in which the United National Independence Party ( UNIP ) and the Liberal Progressive Front (LPF) have sued the government over the hiring of Nikuv Computers to do this year's registration of voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And a former Nikuv Computers employee, Jeffrey Chanda, said there was a possibility that some voters names would be omitted on the final computer printout sheet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chanda said the procedure used to verify information in the computers was such that if something was omitted, a person was required to put zero.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For example if on the application form, your registration number has been correctly put but the computer operator missed out a figure, instead of correcting it, I had to put a zero in that place which would change the meaning of the number,&quot; Chanda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Lipimile said according to the law, any foreign company that is working in Zambia is required to register within 28 days of operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two parties' lawyer, Nosiku Kawanambulu, asked whether the registrar of companies would have had documents if it was registered in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If it was registered, it was going to appear on our local or foreign company registers and we were going to have a file on promoters. We don't have any particulars relating to Nikuv,&quot; Lipimile said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defense counsel solicitor general, Sam Chisulo, asked Lipimile whether in a situation such as this one where the government had hired a foreign company to do work for it in short term, the company would have still to be registered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The question would require for him to interpret the law because the Companies Act requires that the type of business being done in Zambia be stated but for this one I wouldn't exactly know because I don't know what the company is doing here,&quot; said Lipimile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia Independent Monitoring Team vice-president Isaac Zimba also testified on the experience he had in Kaunda Square stage two where a house there was being used to register only MMD members and the fact that the house was not a legal registration place.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Last week's news was devoted to the surrender and committal to an indefinite term of imprisonment of two young heroes Fred M'membe and Bright Mwape. The sentence was passed by Miyanda and Nabulyato for offences committed against their persons in that Fred, Bright and myself did not acknowledge the infallibility of these two god heads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the three of us have made it clear that we have no intention of committing idolatry by &quot;repentance&quot;, the two men may spend some time in prison. But that is what principle, integrity and freedom fighting is all about. That is how South Africa gave birth to Mandela currently doing Africa proud.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am still reported as at large with a K2 million price tag on my head.  I take issue with the description of being at large and with the price tag of K2 million being put on my option not to submit to Nabulyato's unconstitutional decree depriving me of my personal liberty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Article 28 of the Republican constitution tells me that if any of my rights and freedoms vested in me by the Constitution has been, is being or is likely to be contravened I should apply to the High Court for redress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consequently, when Nabulyato issued his unlawful edict, application was made to the High Court that my right to personal liberty (Article 13), protection of the law (Article 18), right to freedom of expression had been contravened and the court should consider the issues and offer me protection pending final court verdict. Deputy Chief Justice, Bweupe, doesn't believe that a contravention of my rights guaranteed by the constitution should move the court, the protector of last defence at a pace that would have protected Bright, Fred and myself from being deprived of our personal liberties without due process of the law. He set the date for May 7 and advised that meanwhile we go and serve a prison sentence which offends against the constitution, natural justice and plain commonsense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I asked myself: if the institutions which are supposed to ensure that my rights and freedoms under the constitution are not taken away arbitrarily and without regard to the rule of law are unwilling to discharge this sacred duty- who is going to save me from the perverse rule of men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The old age answer points to me as an individual. If today, Nabu-lyato can sign a warrant not provided for under any law purporting to deprive me of my personal liberty and I succumb; tomorrow as a result of this article the same Nabulyato will sign a warrant for my execution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When I appeal to Bweupe under the constitution to save me from death, which is not sanctioned by any law, from the evidence available in this case, I will be told to go and be hanged. The question of whether my hanging was lawful or not can be left to the administrator of my estate to sort out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fight for rights and freedoms has always been an individual one-that is why we have the Nelson Mandela's, Abraham Lincoln, and their genre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Martin Luther King's Civil Rights Movement has origins in the courage of one old black woman, who took up a seat in an all white section of a bus risking being thrown under the wheels of a moving bus. King responded to the life sacrificing courage of that old lady to mobilise the march to freedom to which millions of Americans responded ending with a mammoth rally and with King's &quot;I have a dream&quot; epic speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was in response to the courage of that same woman to exercise her right that galvanised the Kennedy/Johnson Administration to put the state machinery in defence of the rights and freedoms of black America. There is also the story of that courageous black man, the first to enter the all white University in Alabama. He went under the protection of the American Home Guard, who surrounded the university and the lecture hall in which he spent the first day without other white students or lecturers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is those actions, that define the sanctity of the rights and freedoms enshrined in the Bill of Rights and make it a sacred duty for me to defend them to the death. The sacred duty of individuals to fight for their freedoms shouldn't be degraded by cheap price tags of any amount , Kwacha prizes are for drug traffickers, murderers and those who pervert justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> My right to personal liberty won't be taken away without the due process of the law. If I am found tomorrow it must be understood that I, an unarmed woman with a baby on my back will have to be executed for resisting the unlawful deprivation of my personal liberty. My life will be my contribution to the old age struggle of freedom against all forms of slavery, dictatorship and tyranny such as that of Nabulyato and Miyanda that detracts from my dignity as a human being. This is why I object to the cheapening of the issues involved in the Nabu-lyato saga to K2 million. Freedom is priceless;that is why Fred and Bright surrendered to imprisonment; it places the fight into proper perspective beyond prices but where it focuses the attention of men of honour and integrity and sows the seeds for our own King's style of march to freedom and Zambia's own collective dream of a government established on the principles of human rights and freedoms, equality before the law, justice and governance dictated by the rule of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, I am not at large; I am protecting my constitutional right to liberty, protection of the law, freedom of expression until the matter comes before the courts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - THE new Republican Constitution should stop the current legalised discrimination against women, Non-Governmental Organisation Committee (NGOCC) chairperson Susan Jere demanded in a press statement released on International Women's Day on Friday last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The current Republican Constitution of Zambia allows discrimination of women under customary law, marriage law and personal law,&quot; Jere said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Article 23 of the 1991 Constitution which purports to protect women against discrimination actually serves to legalise discrimination in wide areas of administrative and social practice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said the nation is living in a critical moment as to the protection of women's rights and eradication of discrimination based on gender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The submissions to this effect by the women's movement to the Mwanakatwe Constitution Review Commission were incorporated in its draft but the government in its white paper No 1 rejected these submissions and maintained the current laws and practices,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the University of Zambia Department of Development Studies lecturer Charlotte Wonani, who led UNZA students in a march past Friday from the Lusaka main Post Office to the High Court, said women are eventually succeeding in their battle for equal rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The fact that women now can gather and have their message heard indicates a major success in our fight for equalJrights,&quot; Wonani said in an interview after the march past.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The ANC welcomes the major thrust of the 1996/97 budget and would like to urge the government to remain firmly focused throughout the year on the critical areas of RDP delivery as envisaged in the Minister's speech. We fully support his view that this is The Year of Meaningful Delivery on the RDP. In this context, the government is urged to develop clearly implementable plans to achieve this objective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We see the budgets of the Government of National Unity as building blocks in the transition process from an Apartheid era through reconstruction and development to full democracy . In a number of areas, reprioritisation still needs to be driven firmly and the government should develop fairly quickly, the multi-year fiscal plan which the Minister has made mention of.  This is critical in ensuring a decisive break with the past.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The budget should have a positive impact on economic development in the coming year and every effort should be made to galvanise the country around this perspective. Job creating measures should be enhanced and policies tightly co-ordinated so that we do not lose the momentum required for this gigantic task. In this regard, the ANC welcomes the emphasis placed on the creation of jobs by the Minister. We are extremely concerned that over the past year, very few jobs have been created in both the private and public sectors of the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this context, the government will need to concentrate its efforts more effectively at the national public works programme as one of the job creating strategies. This will contribute both towards poverty alleviation and development, particularly in areas of infrastructural development and upgrading. The ANC would like to urge the government to consider a more bold initiative which ensures and takes advantage of complementarities between the RDP and public works programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African National Congress notes the progress being made in the area of taxation policy. We need to move with some speed in bringing to finality the work of the Katz Commission so that certainty can be achieved. In this budget, we would like to make special mention of the way in which the incorporation of the retirement industry into the tax system has been addressed. The Minister and his department have handled this matter in a responsible and strategic manner. The ANC therefore calls upon the industry to cooperate with the authorities in making these proposals a success . There is no cause in our view for any alarm on the part of members of retirement funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As far as VAT is concerned, we are pleased that the Minister was wise enough not to heed some of the more short-sighted and insensitive &quot;free advice&quot; to raise the rate and again has set out a strategic approach to this issue. As stated by the ANC on numerous occasions before, VAT is an effective yet regressive tax which in the absence of a social security system, would place an undue burden on the poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are encouraged by the progress being made with regard to personal taxes. We note that the middle and lower income earners will receive some relief. We urge the government to continue to do more in this regard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The year's budget is beginning to show signs of the required shift in allocations towards our objectives as contained in the RDP. We are particularly pleased to see that through reducing expenditure on non-priority areas such as nuclear energy, the defence special account, the General Export Incentive Scheme and administrative expenditure in the education department, the government has been able to provide additional resources available for education, state aided training centres, community policing, health care, housing , water affairs, land redistribution and welfare. There has also been allocations to the RDP fund as promised. We are also pleased to see that in this budget, for the first time, full information is provided indicating how these funds will be allocated. This is good news for our people. The government needs to ensure that this time next year, we must not be lamenting about unspent funds. Funds allocated must be spent effectively and timeously!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC supports the policy of the government with regard to the commitment to reduce the budget deficit in a gradual and systematic manner.  The overall level of indebtedness is a serious problem which demands careful management. The current level of the debt as a percentage of GDP imposes tremendous difficulties for fiscal policy. An effective debt management strategy and system is therefore critical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commitment to gender equality and equity in the budget is to be welcome.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - South Africa may have suffered the extreme disappointment of exiting stage left from cricket's World Cup after their quarter-final defeat against a resurgent West Indies in Karachi on Monday, But where they certainly emerged as winners out of all 12 competing countries was in the public relations arena.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hansie Cronje and his team created a high- profile image while in Pakistan for the World Cup and the people of that country took them warmly to their hearts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa were perhaps fortunate to play all their group matches in just the one country while the likes of Sri Lanka criss- crossed the sub-continent like a cricketing yoyo, but they did everything just right as far as people-relations were concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After their own national team, who it would appear from countless newspaper articles in Karachi and Lahore, had effectively committed treason in losing to India in their powder-keg quarter-final, Pakistanis were right behind South Africa to go all the way in the World Cup.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not for them the likes of gutless Australia who had refused to play their Group A match against Sri Lanka because of the bomb attack on January 31 which killed over 30 people in Colombo. At the time, Cronje publicly stated that he and his team would have had no qualms about playing in Sri Lanka --- and that was one example of many statements or actions where the South African team did the right thing, pure and simple.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, if one was to put under the spotlight the public image of Hansie Cronje and England's Michael Atherton during the World Cup, it would be hard to find a more black- and-white contrast. Cronje, with great similarity to his rugby counterpart Francois Pienaar, now seems to have an instinctive feel to say and do the appropriate thing at the appropriate time --- whether publicly, at a press conference or in the high street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Almost embarrassingly at the other end of the scale, the hapless Atherton appears to have the diplomatic dexterity and nimbleness of feet of a drunk elephant with its feet encased in concrete blocks. The Lancashire man has clearly been affected for the long term by the tabloid press in Britain and these days he simply does not care how his image is perceived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet bloody-minded though he might wish to be, his reference to a local journalist as &quot;a buffoon&quot; after the England/South Africa match in Rawalpindi, represented a major error of judgment in manners --- never mind an error by an England captain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Managing director of the United Cricket Board of South Africa Ali Bacher is well aware of the integral part that the team and the individual image plays in modern-day cricket. &quot;We have very strong views that the image of the game is crucially important --- as well as the image of the players,&quot; Bacher said the day after South Africa's loss to the West Indies in Karachi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The players must behave on and off the field in a manner which befits the great traditions of the game. It is important to reflect the ethos of the game and, not withstanding the professionalism, that must be paramount.  Certainly we in South Africa are very strong in giving every possible back-up support behind the scenes to our players to handle the responsibilities and the pressures that now await international cricketers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bacher believes that it is impossible for a young player today to enter the realms of international cricket and not to make errors of judgment and to be able to handle the press confidently unless he is guided accordingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The young players need assistance. If you take cricketers like Paul Adams and Jacques Kallis, if you don't brief them and give them support behind the scenes, they're going to run into problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But we have our Plascon academy which runs every winter and one of the important aspects of that academy is to brief and to guide and almost to educate the young cricketers in these responsibilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Hansie understands the need of the captain to play his part in insuring that the sponsors are looked after, that the media are looked after, that the administrators are looked after and that the ordinary folk in the street are looked after. All in all, we're very proud of our team. And we must never get away from that aspect of cricket which is part of the culture of the game. We must preserve it and certainly we in South Africa will do our utmost to ensure that all the players who represent our country are well-briefed and well-versed in their responsibilities to the great game of cricket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bacher emphasises that the United Cricket Board of South Africa will always take a firm stance in this regard: &quot;We are going to drive a very firm and professional show where the players become paramount in our marketing strategy, but, within this context, there has to be discipline and there have to be contractual obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At the end of the day, the players have got to know their responsibilities to us and we've got to know our responsibilities to the players to ensure that, ultimately, the game of cricket flourishes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The Cape Town Olympic Bid committee is about to clinch the two crucial sponsorship deals that will bring it close to the R80-million it needs to fund its bid to host the 2004 Olympic Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two sponsors, almost certainly Sun International and South African Airways, are expected to announce their backing within the next few weeks.  SAA is apparently planning a lavish ceremony to announce its support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bid committee has already secured support from major corporations like Mercedes-Benz, Unifruco, Eskom, Caltex and Nedbank. However, R80-million is the minimum the committee has to raise if it hopes to present a credible bid.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bid representative Paul Johnson would not confirm either SAA or Sun International's participation. He did say that official announcements could be expected soon from a major airline and hotel group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The procurement of sponsors is ongoing,&quot; he told the Mail &amp; Guardian.  &quot;Estimates of how much money we need have ranged from R75- million to R90-million, but the most recent audit showed that R80-million was the cut-off mark.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bid committee has tried to woo sponsors by offering a package of exclusive marketing rights. These include the right to use Cape Town's Olympic bid logo --- a map of Africa made up of the South African colours over the words: Cape Town 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another drawcard was to accept only one major sponsor from a specific industry sector. Hence Mercedes Benz will be the only motor manufacturer to support the bid. SAA as the only large South African airline was the sole credible candidate for the committee. It would not even have had to come up with a generous package to have its name attached to the bid, although it would have to do better than suppliers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Suppliers get to label themselves according to the service they provide.  However, to be recognised as a supporter would take substantial financial support. Sun International is already an official sponsor of the South African Olympic team taking part in Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sponsorship runs until September 1997 when the winning city is announced. After that, sponsorship has to be renegotiated with the International Olympic Committee (IOC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The immediate challenge facing the committee is the presentation of its bid book, which takes place in August. The book, to be published by Churchill Murray, is a technical manual written to specific requirements setting out the bidding city's proposals on how it will provide transport, sports facilities and various other essential elements of hosting the games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IOC will select a shortlist of candidates on the strength of the bid books from the 11 competing cities. About half will be eliminated after the books have been analysed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deposed South African Rugby Football Union (Sarfu) chief executive officer Edward Griffiths is to edit the book. Griffiths told the M&amp;G he took the job as a stop-gap until his fight to get his post back was settled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My priority is my reinstatement with Sarfu,&quot; Griffiths said. Sarfu president Louis Luyt fired Griffiths without explanation last month. He said he had no plans to stay on after August, although he would consider extending his commitment if he failed to win back his Sarfu job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Griffiths payed a major role in organising the Rugby World Cup, experience which will no doubt greatly benefit in planning the bid presentation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Griffiths dismissed critics who say the event is too large for Cape Town to handle: &quot;A year before the world cup there were great fears that we could not manage such a large event. What happened was we hosted the most successful world cup ever. The bid will take an enormous amount of work, but the underlying success of South Africa is its ability to think big. It can be done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Griffiths said even if Cape Town did not win the bid to host the Games, &quot;the impressive thing about the bid is that it will transform a city of two halves into a single entity.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - One of the key components of Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg's Budget is to address fears around the budget deficit and government debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These blight an otherwise impressive economic record that boasts the most buoyant growth, lowest inflation, largest net capital inflows and most sizeable fixed investment in two decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liebenberg's numbers for the 1996/97 fiscal year move in the right direction, albeit slowly. The deficit amounts to 5,1% of gross domestic product (GDP) against 6% in 1995/96 (5,5% if transfers to the Central Energy Fund are excluded). The total debt comes to 55,6% of GDP (56%).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government's deficit is well above the 3% mark that influential institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank consider stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is not about ideology or economic orthodoxy. Even a 5,1% deficit figure is a major turn-off to potential investors, both domestic and foreign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a world where fiscal prudence is the trend, globally integrated markets judge economies harshly by voting with their money. Liebenberg talks about reducing the deficit by 0,5 percentage points in the next few years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's government debt is just below the 60% mark that these institutions consider prudent before a country gets caught in a so- called debt trap. But the trend in South Africa is ominous --- in 1980 to 1981 government debt was 30% of GDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The interest bill (R34,4-billion) amounts to 20% of total spending (18% in 1995/96) and tax revenue is up from 24,6% of GDP in 1995/96 to 25,1%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The deficit totals R28,8-billion (revenue of R145-billion less expenditure of R174- billion).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If loan redemptions are included the gross borrowing requirements for 1996/97 amount to R45,1-billion against R38,4-billion in 1995/96.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This will be financed from short-term loans (R3-billion), government bonds (R36,6-billion) and foreign loans (R2,5-billion).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> None of this should prove a problem and put pressure on interest rates, but foreign borrowing becomes expensive when the rand depreciates. The 100-million bond now costs R620-million to redeem compared with R540- million when it was issued earlier this year. In 1995/96, R1,8-billion was raised. In addition to the pound, there was a Japanese yen issue that raised around R1,2-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the local bond market, the bulk of the funds will be raised in the R153 (matures in parts in 2009, 2010 and 2011), a new 2006 stock and reopened R177 (2007) and R175 (2002) bonds. The R157 (maturing over 2015, 2016 and 2017), which has raised some R18-billion from the Public Investment Commission, will also be put into the market. The bond market gave the final favourable verdict --- rates on the R150 fell from 15,48% just before the budget to 14,88% directly after Liebenberg spoke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Longer term investors might take a more sombre view. First, Liebenberg's figures have to be trusted. Last year a deficit of 5,8% was budgeted for, or R29-billion. It ended up at 6% (R30-billion).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main factors behind this larger deficit are serious provincial overspending and shoddy former homeland finances, expenditure of votes from previous years brought forward into this fiscal year, the removal of import surcharges and lower value-added tax revenue owing to reduced inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The major economic problems with a large public debt include &quot;crowding out&quot; private investment, adding to inflationary pressures, impairing incentives to innovate and invest and undermining monetary policy and hence putting pressure on interest rates.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Economic growth last year was the best on record since 1988, despite setbacks in the agricultural and mining sectors and a slip in the fourth quarter owing to a decline in manufacturing output. But the doomsters are gaining voice, forecasting a leveling off in activity as the business cycle takes its course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a climate of falling inflation, growing investment and improved competitiveness, Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg is optimistic about our economic prospects. A gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 3,5 to 4% is expected for the current financial year, but there are some provisos: gross domestic saving fell to 18,5% of GDP last year, against an average of more than 25% in the 1970s and 1980s. South Africa cannot rely on foreign investment alone to achieve sustainable growth.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government is doing its bit, keeping a tight rein on fiscal policy, thereby creating an investor-friendly climate. In fact, Liebenberg's deficit target is now an even more ambitious 4% by 1998/99.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But if the world economy as a whole is indeed nearing the peak of the boom --- as indicated by Liebenberg --- then cutting the deficit so sharply would be counter-productive, says Dr Peter Hilsenrath of Syfrets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Slower world GDP growth implies a more difficult environment for South African exporters. And with slowing domestic private investment, as well as expected weaker private consumption growth, it is imperative that government investment kicks in to provide counter-cyclical stabilisation.&quot; Foreign investment, both direct and portfolio, would be the loser, he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liebenberg may be acting in anticipation of a recession --- cutting now while the going is still relatively good. Otherwise, the deficit could balloon to 10%, which would definitely not send the right signals to foreign and local investors, says Dennis Dykes, chief economist of Nedcor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other big blot on the economic horizon is unemployment --- but a clear plan for job creation was conspicuous by its absence. Liebenberg reiterated government's commitment to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 500 000 new jobs a year by 1999, as outlined by Thabo Mbeki, the deputy president, last month, but gave no indication how this was to be realised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If past performance is anything to go by, the private sector cannot be relied upon to step into the breach: only 55 000 jobs outside the agricultural industry were created in the first year of the upswing, to mid-1995. Liebenberg did, however, highlight the structural problems in the labour market and made a point of setting out the urgent need for more information on how the formal sector works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We need to understand the consequences of increased sub-contracting, self-employment and more flexible working arrangements,&quot; he said. &quot;Unless we do, government will not know the actual changes in income generating employment or the wage elasticity of employment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly, he said, the links between formal sector employment and real income changes and the activities of the informal sector need to be better researched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fine print of the Budget book outlines some positive steps in addressing the structural problems besetting job creation, such as land reform, support for small farmers, industrial policy and export promotion, small business development and vocational training. Indeed, education is a top priority for government expenditure this year, with R5,5 billion of the total cake, against R4,3 billion last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Improved RDP delivery is expected to boost job creation but there was disappointment at the dearth of direct measures. Said Dannhauser van der Merwe, general secretary of the Federation of South African Labour Unions (Fedsal), &quot;Only R100-million was allocated to public works programmes; much more could have been done, plus we have to make sure that the benefits are not undermined by huge job losses through privatisation and public sector restructuring.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liebenberg was at pains to emphasise the holistic nature of this year's Budget; it was not merely a one-off financial exercise designed exclusively for1996/97. &quot;Some of the measures taken this year should yield results in the short term, others would probably take a year or more, while some should facilitate changes envisaged for later years,&quot; he said on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commentators have been quick to criticise in the past, complaining of too much rhetoric and not enough action. The government is aware that it cannot afford to fiddle while Rome burns any longer --- as long as growth stays on track, there is room for putting fiscal promises into practice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The 10,4% increase in total expenditure is higher than expected, mainly owing to the R6- billion allotted to improvement of conditions of service. The process of restructuring the public service is expensive in the first year, says Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg, but the benefits of a more efficient civil service will quickly outweigh the costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The process involves downsizing and rightsizing: flattening the gradings, ironing out inequities and paying market-related salaries to encourage skilled workers to stay in the public service. No figure was put on the total number of redundancies envisaged; despite the burgeoning unemployment problem, the measure was generally welcomed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liebenberg stressed a commitment to delivery; revamping the public service is a huge part of that initiative, as is the new South African Revenue Service (SARS), to go on line next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The issue of roll-overs was highlighted as part of the new efficiency drive. Housing, while allotted a lower amount than last year, will come out with R4,6-billion, owing to the backlog of unspent monies in the Reconstruction and Development Programme Fund and National Housing Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Education scores with R5,5-billion against R4,3-billion last year.  Substantial increases in subsidies to universities and technikons are envisaged, as is a R300-million fund to assist financially disadvantaged students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defence spending, while down from 4,5% of Gross Domestic Product to less than 2% this year, is still high at R10,2-billion. Scaling down the defence force is never easy; the defence lobby is a powerful one, says one analyst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On balance there were few surprises in the expenditure plans, or indeed, in the taxation changes. While the levy on pension funds was expected, other revenue-generating measures amounted merely to tinkering. Excise taxes could have been higher, says the health lobby, while the increase in estate duty and donations tax to 25% was seen as a first step to a capital transfer tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'Clearly the government has broadly accepted (Michael) Katz's views on capital transfer tax and a threefold increase in this area of taxation can be expected in the fullness of time. In addition to the rate hike, action on the treatment of interest-free loans in estate planning and restriction on generation- skipping devices can be expected in the capital transfer tax act when it arrives, probably in 1997,&quot; said Tenk Loubser of Price Waterhouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lowering of the secondary tax on companies and the marketable securities tax was welcomed. The South African Chamber of Business pointed out, however, that company taxes are still very high relative to our competitors, and called for their abolition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If there was one criticism of the Budget, from business to labour, it was the lack of boldness. Sacob said that while it took some fiscal steps in the right direction, it did not meet the economic challenges that lie ahead.  &quot;Some tough decisions that are needed to improve South Africa's economic performance have not been taken.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg -There was a predictably mixed reaction from political parties to Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg's 1996/97 budget on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African National Congress welcomed the fact that Liebenberg had not succumbed to the &quot;short-sighted and insensitive free advice&quot; of the likes of the South African Foundation to sharply increase value-added tax (Vat) while slashing the deficit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was never likely anyway, given the extensive consultations with representatives of both business and labour ahead of the budget, but rank and file members must have been somewhat alarmed by the widespread publicity given to the foundation's suggestions and wondered who would win the war of words.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Labour Minister and chairman of the ANC's national executive economics committee Tito Mboweni said that the budget was a clear rebuff of the foundation's outdated views and set a more sustainable course for growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the ANC did give notice that it expected the government to &quot;remain firmly focused throughout the year on the critical areas of Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) delivery&quot; and, as Liebenberg had said, make this the Year of Meaningful Delivery on the RDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mboweni said that although some progress had been made in reprioritising government spending, more should be done, especially to support the critical task of job creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He believed that labour intensive public works programmes could play an important role in creating jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC also welcomed progress in introducing tax reform but said that this should be speeded up &quot;so that certainty can be achieved&quot;. The controversial introduction of a 17% tax on pension fund income had been handled in a &quot;responsible and strategic manner&quot; and Mboweni called on the industry to co-operate with government to make it work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is no cause in our view for any alarm on the part of members of retirement funds,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National Party finance representative Theo Alant condemned plans to tax pension fund interest and rental income as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; measure that would affect savings. Freedom Front finance representative Willie Botha said the tax &quot;targeted the sitting ducks providing for their retirement&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Democratic Party finance representative called the budget a &quot;spend now, pay later budget&quot; because the budget had not been cut substantially and had instead raided retirement funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The government is forcing future generations of taxpayers and pensioners to pay for its inability to control its excessive expenditure,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alant welcomed the fact that the government had adopted sound economic policies that had demonstrably led to growth, but warned against complacency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The challenge facing the Government of National Unity is to strengthen confidence in the new South Africa and in the government's ability to maintain peace and law and order, and to apply sound economic policies amid signs of growing tensions and support for populist policies,&quot; Alant said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the positive side, most parties welcomed the reduction of the secondary tax on companies and marketable securities tax, but equally hoped that the planned revamp of revenue collection services would show rapid results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liebenberg is banking on getting an extra R1,5-billion from the revamped service but Alant said that progress in getting this up and running had been &quot;unacceptably slow&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fact that all parties agreed on the need for fiscal discipline and reducing the budget deficit bodes well for continued efforts to bring the deficit down. But the proof of the pudding will be in the eating, and it might not be very palatable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg -This year's Budget had not been expected to raise the roof, nor did it. But Chris Liebenberg, the Minister of Finance, was quietly confident it would be well received by the markets, big business and labour alike. He insisted it was most definitely not a standstill Budget, nor a &quot;holding operation&quot;; indeed, in many respects, it showed courage and innovation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Business had other ideas. The South African Chamber of Business (Sacob) had pushed for a 1% hike in value-added tax (VAT) --- that didn't happen. But the expected levy on the retirement funds did, at 17%.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sacob was unimpressed: &quot;The decision to tax the income of pensions funds will be extremely onerous administratively and is, in Sacob's opinion, badly flawed as it amounts to little more than a raid on the nation's savings.  This, combined with the decision not to increase the VAT rate at this time, sends out the wrong message in respect of the relative discouragement of consumption and the encouragement of savings and raises questions about the ability of the government to take tough, and possibly politically unpopular decisions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liebenberg emphasised that no deals were done; there was no &quot;trade-off&quot; between labour and the pensions industry. Raising VAT made no sense when substantial unused funds were being rolled over, with the concomitant wasted opportunities for job creation. But the pensions bullet had to be bitten: South Africa's contractual savings industry was the second best in the world, he said, because of low taxes. Its wealth had to be addressed and the Katz Commission proposals made perfect sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Furthermore, the regressive nature of VAT argued against an arbitrary increase. To the criticisms from the pension fund industry that the levy will hit the lower-income groups hardest, Liebenberg's response was swift: over a longer-term period of 10 to 15 years, it is the highest income groups that pay more, while the lowest benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sacob wanted an investor-friendly Budget and in many respects that call was answered. The Secondary Tax on Companies was lowered --- by more than the expected 10%, from 25% to 12,5% and the Marketable Securities Tax was cut in half to 0,5%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Liebenberg re-affirmed the government's commitment to fiscal discipline: the Budget deficit target is 5,1% of gross domestic product (GDP), against an out-turn of 6% for 1995/96. The public debt total, therefore, is projected at 55,6% of GDP, compared to 56% last year, so the debt trap spectre is fading, slightly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consumers, as long as they don't smoke, drink or drive, have reason to cheer. In line with the government's pledge to iron out personal income tax inequities, tax bands have been further consolidated; the top rate of income tax now kicks in at R100 000 and the minimum tax threshold has been raised from R14 600 to R15 580.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reaction in the markets was good; the long bond rate was strong at 14,9% after the speech, having been 15,4% in the morning, and the rand also took heart, rising against the dollar to R3,89.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But business and the markets alike had hoped for a more definite statement on relaxing exchange controls and privatisation. All Liebenberg said on the former was that the government was still on track for a gradual move at some stage but that the Budget was not the proper platform for such announcements; on the latter he said steady progress is being made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His moves towards restructuring the public sector were well received, as were his pledges for more efficient tax collection. Indeed, he could hardly justify an increase in VAT when R10-billion slips through the tax net every year. To this end, the South African Revenue Service will be launched next month --- although the position of chief executive remains empty.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg -It began as an ordinary press conference --- one of those affairs where journalists drink too much, get indigestion from bland answers to banal questions as well as stodgy snacks, and swear never to sacrifice another Saturday afternoon to media hype. But by the time Tina Turner made a predictably, but not insultingly, belated appearance, the pokerfaced press corps had become a cheerleading squad and chorus line, rocking and singing to the sounds of Turner's promotional video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are many epithets to describe the lady with the legs that have launched a thousand fantasies, the sonorous yet gritty voice, the smile that could double as a lighthouse and, of course, the sexual energy that is measurable on the Richter scale. But the two words that come to mind most often in relation to a woman whose career has spanned over three decades are reinvention and return.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since 1953, when an adolescent and rather blousy Tina Turner from Nutbush City first sang, literally, for her supper, through the 1980s when she claimed her rightful place in the vanguard of popular music, Turner has been resurrected and redefined over and over again. Her post-Ike struggles are already the stuff of contemporary pop-lore, as are her stage and screen performances alongside the royalty of the rock kingdom. Her songs --- like Simply the Best and Private Dancer --- have become international trans-generational anthems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sure, her career hasn't been entirely contradiction-free, as demonstrated by her 1979 performance at Sun City in contravention of the cultural boycott, and her Farewell tour in 1988, which turned out to be anything but a goodbye. But in response to a pointed question about why she had returned after such a grand finale, Turner replied: &quot;I still want to fill stadiums, I still have so much to say, to sing and to discover.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Which accounts in part for her return to South Africa. Having arrived a month before she is due to perform the South African leg of her Wildest Dreams tour, Turner will spend the next few weeks rehearsing at Sun City with her team of internationally acclaimed supporting musos, and simultaneously rediscovering the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I remember how wild my first visit to South Africa was,&quot; she says. &quot;It just seems like a great place to be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her answer to the question of whether she regrets her first ill-timed visit is an unambiguous &quot;No!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Simply put, Turner doesn't seem to have a politically canny bone in her well-honed body. Free of camera enhancements, she seems also refreshingly at odds with her vampish media image: more demure, much smaller, yet paradoxically bigger --- and unmistakably better. She also seems remarkably free of guile or expediency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not for her the dabbing of tears from over- rouged cheeks, or the obligatory sermonising on spiritual homecoming. And she doesn't come across as a talking press-release. Asked how she plans to contribute to the upliftment of black South Africans, she runs a hand through her short, streaked hair (one of many wigs, she frankly admits): &quot;I don't know, I've just arrived.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When informed that she is an inspiration to all victims of abusive relationships --- an accolade she probably receives at every press conference --- she appears almost coy. Her answers are predictable but spoken, believe it or not, with convincing sincerity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And when a glazed-eyed journalist dedicates an erotic sonnet to her beauty and sexual allure, she seems genuinely delighted. In response to a question about what turns her on in a man, she points to the impromptu bard --- who looks on the verge of climax or collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And her perceptions of South Africa? &quot;Too soon,&quot; she says, &quot;but on the way back from the airport I passed cars filled with black South Africans and they smiled at me. It wasn't like I had a sign saying Tina Turner on the roof or anything. But I got the impression that this is a really happy place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A nayve observation, perhaps, but who can blame her when a crowd of hype-hardened drain- sniffers are sitting at her feet softly crooning: &quot;Simply the best.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tina Turner performs at Newlands in Cape Town on April 20, at King's Park in Durban on April 23, and at the Johannesburg Stadium on April 26</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg -If there exists a single structure which encapsulates the apartheid era in all its banal brutality, it is the George Goch hostel in Jeppestown. A concrete monolith housing male, Zulu-speaking migrant workers, the drab edifice is enlivened only by shouts of laughter coming from the match-box windows, and the squatter shacks that have sprouted just beyond the razor-wire boundary, like weeds through pavement cracks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is familiar turf to Johnny Clegg. But tonight his visit has an edge of urgency. He has come to recruit &quot;soldiers&quot; from the hostel's dance teams to join The Full Story - -- Clegg and Sipho Mchunu's one-off concert in Johannesburg, to be held on March 20.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mission is not proceeding as planned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier, Clegg attempts to rehearse at the Mega Music Warehouse with the Meadowlands Choir, only to discover their Zulu pronunciation fails to match the rich timbres of their vocal chords. In a rousing rendition of Asimbonanga, Clegg almost succeeds in transforming the urbane, Sotho-speaking choir into rough-edged, melodic impis. He coaxes them with a display of street-swaggering Zulu, peppering it with a chorus of &quot;sex, drugs, rock'n'roll&quot; and weaving the melody through the circle of earnest minstrels.  The pitch rises and the pace quickens in time to his rhythmic foot-stomping and finger-clicking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Uh no, guys, you draw out the syllables too much. They've got to be sharper, more clipped.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is one of those delicious ironies that an English-speaking white boy should be instructing homeboys how to sing --- if not in their own tongue, then in one they are familiar with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is an irony that is enthusiastically embraced by Clegg.  Anthropologist by day, impi by night, businessman, muso, husband, father, Zimbabwe-born struggle brat, white Zulu, cultural hero, he and Mchunu changed the face of South African pop at a time when apartheid contrived to keep their cultures apart. These are epithets which Clegg accepts --- in a shrugging, good-humoured sort of way --- and eschews, because they cannot encapsulate the contradictions that colour his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When I was lecturing in the anthroplogy department at Wits,&quot; he recalls, &quot;there was this expectation that, as a progressive person, one would be capable of uniting all the conflicting sides of oneself and becoming a truly integrated adult,&quot; he says. &quot;But, for me, that is impossible. I have learnt, rather, to accept the fragments and the changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is a part of myself that identifies with the life of a migrant worker and the accompanying sense of dislocation and displacement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Which goes some of the way towards explaining the rationale behind his official musical reunion with Mchunu. It is not, he insists, simply a nostalgic attempt to rediscover romanticised roots, or to recapture the glorious epoch when Juluka articulated and symbolised the pain of apartheid and the joy of breaking down barriers of race class and culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clegg explains: &quot;Sipho and I have come together again because, although the bond has never been broken, we want to make the most of the choices and changes. Most importantly, we want to try out the magic again, to see if it still works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sitting outside the George Goch hostel, Clegg speaks about the exhilaration of change, and the new challenges ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Before, the type of songs we sang were of necessity determined by apartheid, but there's an incredible sense of liberation in being able to sing about the contradictions of daily life, about anything. Obviously there has been a loss of innocence in the process. We also tend to romanticise the epoch in which we discovered most about ourselves. In retrospect though, it remains just like any other epoch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He adds: &quot;This concert will be completely different to the old ones, with a 15-man dance troupe, a 20-piece big-voiced choir, as well as state-of-the-art lighting and staging.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But alongside Clegg's enthusiasm is an unmistakable note of anxiety. His desire to recruit a 15-man dance team from the hostel has run into a potentially serious snag. The migrant elders are demanding a meeting that will decide --- less than a week before the show --- whether Clegg's request will be met. At the core of the problem are rivalries between the hostels along the East Rand. George Goch houses most of the dancers, but Jeppe hostel is the domain of the Zulu elders, and in order to get permission to recruit and train the dancers, Clegg has to travel to Benoni hostel to negotiate with a 20-strong committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After a lengthy session of &quot;quietly probing but repectful questions&quot; conducted over litres of Coke and Lemon Twist, an elated Clegg reports that the committee has agreed to let him use the dancers of his choice. It is then that the other Cleggs melt away, and Clegg the Zulu impi merges with the anthropologist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Meeting this hostel committee reinforces how traditional hierarchies, structures and codes of honour enable people to carry on, to keep themselves intact. These men come from an enclave in Natal that has been all but forgotten in the process of change. And they are trying desperately to hold on to and perpetuate their beliefs in order to make sense of a changing world. They are men of honour who want nothing more --- not even a percentage of the money I pay the dancers --- than the knowledge that their dancers will be acknowledged and treated well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He continues: &quot;This process has been like a time warp, like the days of Juluka when we had to fight to prevent the venues we were performing at from closing down, and negotiate our way through every song and concert. I'd almost forgotten about what it was like, what energy it took and generated to play in those days. How wonderful it was.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The reconciliation process in Namibia --- carefully nurtured by President Sam Nujoma since independence --- is teetering after a row over Swapo's treatment of detainees during the liberation struggle and allegations of crimes committed by policemen in defence of apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The row has led to calls for a South African- style truth commission, but also to unprecedented threats of &quot;civil war&quot; from the secretary general of Swapo, Namibia's ruling party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A warrant officer in the Namibian police force, Linus Leumbo, sparked off the row by writing to the local press pointing fingers at serving and retired policemen. He alleges that, among other things, these men, whom he named, knew exactly who pulled the trigger on the gun that killed Swapo activist Anton Lubowski.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Matters took a surprising turn two weeks ago with the publication of The Wall of Silence, a book written by Pastor Siegfried Groth, a German clergyman. The book details torture and other forms of cruel and unusual punishment that Swapo meted out at its camps to perceived renegade members of its guerrilla army. At a church convention last week, clergymen asked that a truth commission be set up urgently to probe the accusations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To Nujoma, that was the last straw. Last week, he went on Namibian television and, for about half an hour, conducted a personal diatribe against Groth and Christo Lombard, one of the pastor's helpers, whom he referred to as &quot;an apostle of apartheid&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president said Groth was &quot;never a friend of Swapo&quot; and, therefore, not a champion of the liberation cause. Nujoma charged the book was a one-sided story loaded with &quot;lies&quot; and said that since the pastor was not ashamed of writing these &quot;untruths&quot;, he was stepping in to set the record straight in order to maintain &quot;social order&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nujoma's address added fuel to the fire, and some accused him of abusing his access to state television to promote Swapo's cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This week, in one of the most venomous post- independence speeches from Swapo yet, party secretary-general Moses Garoseb said Swapo had opted for reconciliation but Groth and others were opening old wounds. &quot;So, let us open them and see how it hurts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saying Nujoma had been insulted, he declared: &quot;I will not reconcile myself, I am on a war path. Maybe what we need in this country now is civil war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the party would not apologise to Swapo fighters who were tortured. &quot;Apologise for what? For defeating the Boers? That is an insult to us black people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Disturbingly, Garoseb called on Swapo supporters to prepare for war, warning of &quot;bloodshed in this country&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Leumbo says he is determined to bring those he fingered to book. He has written to the prosecutor general asking for heads to roll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prosecutor general responded by saying the name supplied to him by Leumbo as the person who pulled the trigger on Lubowski came from a statement that was taken some years ago. The witness, for some reason, was considered unreliable. So the matter was not pursued and the alleged killer was not interviewed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Leumbo says he smells a rat and alleges that this is all part of a cover-up involving the highest levels of the police force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His mission is by no means restricted to the Lubowski case. He also wants the head of the deputy chief of police and has detailed the man's alleged iniquities at length. The deputy chief professes ignorance and has refused to get into a &quot;mud-slinging match&quot; with the warrant officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Namibian this week reported that the Council of Churches in Namibia has said remarks made by Nujoma on NBC-TV last week subtly attempted to &quot;suppress a constitutionally guaranteed right of freedom of speech&quot; and contained accusations that whipped up fear and uncertainty among sections of Namibian society.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg -The president, the Prince of Wales, the Xhosa paramount chief, the British prime minister, the Eastern Cape premier and a prominent paleo-anthropologist have all been dragged into South Africa's great riddle of a skull with a hole in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Nicholas Gcaleka, a self-appointed sangoma from the Eastern Cape, whipped up controversy when he returned to South Africa from a trip to Scotland early this month with a skull he claims to be that of a Xhosa warrior king killed by British troops at the Cape Colony in the early 1800s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The aggrieved spiritualist was this week in Cape Town trying to see President Nelson Mandela after an imbizo attended by 30 senior chiefs, including Paramount Chief Xoliliswe Sigcau, confiscated the skull so that scientific tests could be done to establish its true identity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chiefs have lodged a wooden box containing the skull for safekeeping at a mortuary in the Transkei town of Willowvale and are busy setting up a panel of scientists who will be asked to establish whether Gcaleka's claim that the skull is that of the legendary King Hintsa kaPhalo is true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sangoma is outraged, saying he was tricked into attending the imbizo at Sigcau's Great Palace and surrendering the skull to the chiefs. Gcaleka told reporters the chiefs have interrupted his plans to rebury the head on May 12, the anniversary of Hintsa's death. He claimed British Prime Minister John Major and the Prince of Wales had telephoned him to say they wanted to attend the ceremony --- and apologise for the chief's slaying in 1835.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela's spokesman Parks Mankahlana confirmed the president had received a letter from the sangoma urging him to intervene in the dispute and the presidency was still considering the matter. But a spokesman for the British High Commission in Cape Town said his office had received no indication that Major or Prince Charles were planning a trip to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Transkei lawyer Mda Mda, appointed to represent the Xhosa paramountcy in this matter, told the Mail &amp; Guardian that the chiefs were planning to consult Professor Phillip Tobias, South Africa's foremost paleo- anthropologist, and other international experts, about setting up a panel to judge Gcaleka's claims --- suggesting the riddle will be solved by a bizarre mix of science and the supernatural.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Gcaleka had been to Bisho last week to lobby Eastern Cape Premier Raymond Mhlaba for the skull to be returned and said the chiefs were asking the provincial government not to intervene until expert DNA and forensic tests on the skull had been conducted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Gcaleka arrived home last weekend, he showed reporters a skull with a neat hole on the right side which was found near Inverness in Scotland. But instead of opening the way for a ceremony designed to bring spiritual peace to the nation, his efforts had the opposite effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiefs and other traditional healers in the Eastern Cape claim Gcaleka is a charlatan out only to make money and boost his image as a sangoma healer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gcaleka claims the hole in the skull is proof that it belonged to Hintsa. But most Xhosa chiefs and other spiritual leaders have disputed this, saying the skull could not be genuine because Hintsa's head was blown apart by his captors. Their scepticism is reinforced by reports in a Scottish newspaper that the skull is actually that of an ancient Celtic monk.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - This is what President Nelson Mandela's diary looks like this week. There are early morning dashes to airports, a meeting with a sports star, that very important meeting in KwaZulu- Natal and plenty of time for rest in between affairs of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As far as possible, most of Mandela's afternoons and every Friday are kept free. This Friday though, the imbizo in KwaZulu- Natal is of critical importance, so his day is full.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three days a week are devoted to African National Congress business --- Mondays, which he spends at Shell House, and Saturdays and Sundays, when he prefers to stay at his Houghton home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By late last year, Mandela began complaining that his schedule was so hectic that he seldom had time to read the newspapers and important state documents. He wanted time out to do this so badly that he remarked that he missed the days on Robben Island, where he could spend time reflecting on issues and penning his responses. So he suggested free time in the afternoon, whenever possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The decision to leave his afternoon free had nothing to do with doctors,&quot; stressed presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela's diary is definitely not as hectic as it was this time last year, said Mankahlana. However, the president's office could not produce last year's diary for comparison as it was in Pretoria and his staffers were all in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Largely, this situation has evolved over a period of time, rather than because of a specific instruction. The staff in the president's office have now all acquainted themselves with the fact that his programme has to be streamlined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If six ministers want to see him on a particular day, perhaps three will be re- routed to the deputy president. Instead of doing an interview once a day, we arrange one a week with four journalists present.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mankahlana said Mandela's programme was currently &quot;manageable and reasonable&quot;, although demands for his time keep rising. &quot;We expect that as long as he is alive, people will want a slice of his time. He is popular, he has strong appeal, and everyone wants him at their event.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More often that not though, Mandela just isn't available to judge a fashion show or snip a ribbon and, when the staff at the presidency believe an event needs a representative, other Ministers are co-opted into service to stand in for the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Some people don't like it when they invite Mandela and someone else arrives to represent him. It's not that they want the president of South Africa to attend, they want Nelson Mandela himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What most people don't realise is that Mandela's diary is thematic. They would stand a better chance of grabbing his attention if their request for his time found symmetry with Mandela's causes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In October and November last year, for instance, his diary was cleared of matters of state while he concentrated on winning support for the local government elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since January, he has had one overriding concern --- peace in KwaZulu-Natal. Mandela's staff have had to shape his programme and make it fit into the president's overall plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Almost all his speeches this year have preached peace, reconciliation, patriotism and nation building. He has consulted often with King Goodwill Zwelithini, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and ANC KwaZulu-Natal leader Jacob Zuma. He has been following Magnus Malan's trial closely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Tuesday he had lunch with Buthelezi to iron out arrangements for the imbizo on Friday. &quot;After Friday's imbizo, he will start gearing up for the local government elections in the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal,&quot; Mankahlana said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;With this much foresight, we are able to add to the president's current project without overworking him. There's no Chinese wall though, we can always pitch the programme according to what's high on the agenda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the diary is drafted by a committee consisting of cabinet secretary Jakes Gerwel, presidential parliamentary councillor Ahmed Kathrada, Mandela's secretary Mary Mxabane and his head of communication Joel Netshitenzhe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> State visits to South Africa and abroad are, naturally, organised months in advance. These are also streamlined, taking into account which countries are most important to visit and which visits can be passed on to the deputy presidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The diary committee meets regularly to consider requests for Mandela's time. Obviously, they cannot allocate every minute detail, anticipate every crisis or cater for their boss's whims. When he wants to meet a sports star, like Springbok swimmer Penny Heyns this week, she's slotted in. If he wants a photo opportunity with her after the meeting, it's likewise arranged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We can plan almost a year in advance for overseas trips, but visits to South Africa come sometimes with as little as a week's notice,&quot; said Kathrada. &quot;So the diary changes all the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We try to take into consideration rest periods for him, but that's also not easy. For instance, when he goes to Transkei to rest, we go out of our way not to disturb him and people land there without previous notice demanding to see him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;While we try to cut down the programme as much as possible, it's difficult, everybody wants a piece of the president.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The chief executive officer of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Dr Biki Minyuku, says he will not differentiate between the victims of apartheid atrocities and those who suffered at the hands of the liberation movements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Minyuku says it is his overall objective to unify individuals who have suffered losses during the years of apartheid, irrespective of which side they were on.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Human rights violations touched the whole spectrum of South African society. &quot;I do not see my role as playing one organisation off against the other. We are dealing with human beings whose rights have been violated and violations know no affiliation,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although he is a card-carrying African National Congress member, Minyuku says he does not regard himself as &quot;overtly&quot; ANC. &quot;The fact that I am an ANC member has nothing to do with my effectiveness and efficiency as CEO to the Truth and Reconciliation Commision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Minyuku says it is his individual right to belong to the ANC, just as it is another's right to belong to any organisation of their choice. However, he would be willing to consider relinquishing his party political membership if the community at large felt it affected his impartiality as the commission's CEO.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The African National Congress has instructed its leadership and members to go to the truth commission if they committed human rights abuses during the anti-apartheid struggle --- and, in a gesture of support for the truth process, has withdrawn temporary immunity given to its members by the old government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The ANC renounces the temporary indemnities (designed to allow exiled members back into the country before the 1994 elections) as they no longer serve any purpose. The ANC will submit its record, leaders and members to the scrutiny of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission,&quot; said a statement issued on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have nothing to hide. Instead we want to help create a climate in which the healing process of our nation is enhanced.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This week the Mail &amp; Guardian asked senior officials and Cabinet ministers from the party how it would deal with amnesty applications from its own members to the truth commission and found the ANC grappling to come up with a consensus policy around a number of sensitive issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It emerged there is concern in the organisation about groups of Umkhonto we Sizwe commanders who are anxious that they will have to shoulder the blame for the guerrilla movement's attacks on civilian targets carried out in the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Members of these groups, said to include some senior MK officials, are demanding to know whether ANC political leaders now in government will go to the commission and accept responsibility for issuing the orders that led to these attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thursday's statement makes it clear that the ANC leadership will support its rank and file by accepting collective responsibility for actions during the anti-apartheid struggle. The M&amp;G has also established that Joe Modise (now defence minister) is willing to go to the truth commission in his capacity as a former MK commander and member of Umkhonto's political military council subject to policy guidelines currently being drafted by the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The ANC will never condone any human rights violations which may have been committed by freedom fighters during the heat of the struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The ANC has already made public the findings of the Motsuenyane and Skweyiya commissions (which investigated abuses at the movement's detention centres in various parts of Africa), for which our entire NEC has taken collective responsibility,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The national executive committee of the ANC recently set up a powerful sub committee including heavyweights like Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, Defence Minister Joe Modise, Intelligence Chief Joe Nhlanhla, Justice Minister Dullah Omar and Transport Minister Mac Maharaj.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This subcommittee has set up a truth commission desk at ANC headquarters to handle a range of issues relating to the truth commission which operates at national and provincial level. Officials in this department have to provide members with advice about how the truth commission will work and has been flooded by requests from victims of abuse at the hands of the security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However some officials have, somewhat unexpectedly, found themselves dealing with requests from members who want amnesty for abuses they committed during the struggle. There were two commissions of inquiry by the ANC into human rights abuses in its detention camps during the 1980's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are hearing some quite shocking things about what people did at this time and it is clear that a lot of people in the organisation are worried about this. We are hoping that the ANC will use the truth commission to finally come clean and deal with these skeletons in its own cupboard,&quot; said one official who asked not to be named because the matter is so sensitive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Early this week Justice Minister Dullah Omar told SABC radio the ANC would instruct its members who feel they committed abuses to approach the truth commission and would adopt an open policy about this. The M&amp;G then submitted a number of questions to the ANC's Department of Information and Publicity and also to the ministers who sit on the NEC subcommittee dealing with the truth commission. These included:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Will the ANC make public the names of its members who apply to the amnesty committee of the truth commission and the nature of the abuses they committed?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * How many ANC members have already applied for amnesty and what categories of human rights abuse are these applications for?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Has the ANC stipulated that members who feel they have committed abuses must go to the commission or is this a voluntary/individual decision?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Will the ANC provide counselling and support for members who decide to approach the truth commission?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a general consensus in the ANC that the organisation was fighting a just struggle against an immoral system and, as a whole, does not have to account for the kind of human rights abuse committed by those who created and fought for the apartheid system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Apartheid was a crime against humanity and the struggle against humanity was pronounced by the whole international community to be just...  The actions of those who fought to maintain apartheid cannot be equated --- morally and politically ---with the actions of those who fought for democracy,&quot; according to the ANC statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, within this broad moral framework, there appears to be two main tendencies within the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One group reacts with indignation at the suggestion that they have anything to account for at the truth commission. Its proponents tend to say attacks against civilians were the exception during the guerrilla struggle and explain the detention camp abuses as the result of heavy infiltration by Pretoria's security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another section of the movement -- which appears to have swayed official policy -- believes the ANC should use the truth commission to deal, in an open and cathartic way, with the abuses committed in the camps and to compensate victims and families of victims who suffered in these detentions centres.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Politicians are now manipulating the prices of mealie meal through their rhetoric, annoyed farmers claimed yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia National Farmers Union (ZNFU) president Ben Kapita said in a press statement that his members were concerned about their future following recent outbursts by politicians over the fixing of the price of Zambia's staple food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kapita wondered how suddenly every minister has assumed the role of agriculture minister and is making statements on maize pricing. &quot;This government has never kept maize prices from falling. When farmers faced ruin in 1993 they were given promissory notes instead of a good maize price, but when prices rise it appears that farmers will not be allowed to benefit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Farmers are extremely concerned for the future,&quot; ZNFU president Ben Kapita said in a statement yesterday. &quot;If prices are fixed now, what hope is there for a profitable maize price when the new crop comes onto the market and the election draws closer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kapita said ZNFU shared the concerns over high mealie meal prices because they affected the 600,000 farmers and their families as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But farmers are even more concerned at recent statements by politicians who are trying to manipulate prices through political rhetoric,&quot; Kapita said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kapita appealed to the politicians, especially ministers to enforce a competition and fair trading act in setting up the long awaited competition commission instead &quot;of making empty noise&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;An impartial investigation, not political rhetoric would show if maize prices are being unfairly fixed,&quot; he suggested. Kapita blamed maize imports on poor agricultural policies and poor handling of the sector by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The ministers who are blaming millers for the high maize meal price must know that stable prices will only come through increased local production which will only be achieved through correct and consistent agricultural policies which are currently lacking,&quot; Kapita said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last Friday health minister, Michael Sata, accused millers of over charging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We called the millers and they gave us the costings of producing a 25kg bag of mealie meal but we discovered that the recommended price could have been around K11,000,&quot; Sata said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier, various government officials including President Chiluba had accused millers of profiteering and threatened to act against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am ordering that market forces must interact in favour of consumers,&quot; Chiluba said on February 22. &quot;This is a serious warning which must be observed immediately.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Kapita said government should blame itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Government must stop blaming others for their on failures,&quot; Kapita said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The closure of Zambia's only recording company, the Teal Records Company, has exposed Zambian music to music pirates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a survey carried out by a Post correspendent, the fastest selling tape on the black market, is a compilation of Zambian music entitled &quot;Zambians.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When it just appeared on the black market sometime last year, it beat all other artistes in sales. And yet none of the money is going into the pockets of the hard working Zambian musicians whose music appears on this tape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Veteran musician Chris Chali of Amayenge Cultural Ensemble whose song 'Mabo' appears on the tape confirmed that there is no one collecting royalties for the cassette.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia Copyrights Society ( ZAMCORPS ) chairman, Jagari Chanda is also at a loss as he seems not to know the source of this pirated work. The only glimmer coming from this dark cloud is perhaps the comfirmation that Zambian music is still very popular.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - Professor Achamyeleh Debela, Director of North Carolina University Computing Center for the Arts, has joined many other Ethiopian scholars in the United States in urging the Italian Government to effect the immediate return of the Axum obelisk looted by Mussoloni in 1937.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Proffesor Achamyeleh issued a statement of support for the return of the obelisk from Durham, North Carolina, to mark the Centenary of the battle of Adwa, which said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Axum Obelisk still in Rome is Ethiopia's cultural treasure, and its removal from its original site by the Italian fascists in 1937 was a grave injustice to the people of Ethiopia, because it deprived them of an extraordinary historical artifact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I was delighted to hear that there was a possibility that the obelisk might at long last be returned, and that Italy of the late twentieth century might prove itself a country of understanding and honor above colonial deceit and injustice.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If I am dismayed and disappointed it is because no visible measure has thus far been taken to honour declarations that the obelisk would be returned, nor are there any clear indications that these declarations will be honored in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is ample reason for concern, for the Italian Peace Treaty, signed in 1947 almost fifty years ago, stated in Article 37 that all loot taken after 3 October 1935, the date of the invasion, should be returned within 18 months, and the patience peoples of Ethiopia have already had to wait almost fifty years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If is of paramount importance that the Italian Government makes a clear statement on the specific steps to be taken for the obelisk s repatriation, and that this be officially communicated to assure the parties concerned. I feel sure that the patience, but persevering, resolve of the peoples of Ethiopia will ensure that justice in this matter will at last be done.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - The House of Peoples Representatives yesterday approved the appointment by the prime minister of the president and vice president of the Federal Supreme Court of the country. The House has also elected three MPs as members of the Federal Commission for Judicial Administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Having been briefed on the personal accounts of the appointees by Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, the House has approved the appointment of Ato Kemal Bedri and Ato Menberetshay Tadesse as president and vice president of the Federal Supreme Court respectively.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prime Minister Meles said Ato Kemal Bedri had been serving in different judicial positions since he graduated in 1973 from the Law Faculty of the Addis Ababa University with LLB degree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The premeir further said Ato Kemal, a Hareri by nationality, has also been working in different capacities after the former military dictatorship was ousted in May 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ato Membere Tsehay Tadesse is also a graduate of the Law Faculty of the Addis Ababa University with LLB degree, according to Ato Meles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prime Minister Meles said Ato Menbertsehay, a Tigrean by nationality, had also graduated from a foreign university with a post graduate diploma in his career.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ato Zenebe Alemayehu, a candidate for membership kin the Federal Commission for Judical Administration, lost the election because he got only 10 of the total vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The House has later promulgated the law setting the parliamentry recession period as enshrined in the Constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accordingly, the month-long parliamentary recess will begin on March 10 and end on 10 April. A similar recess of the House will also begin on July 8 and on the Monday of the last week of the Ethiopian month of Meskerem.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Besieged with an unfavourable economic situation since the end of the Cold War, Africa now finds itself under pressure to adopt the usage of new information technology which thrives on computers, if it is to compete with the rest of the world favourably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Information transfer is central in enhancing economic development in any part of the world. Currently, there is talk about globalization of computer usage for data accessibility. At the bottom-line is information transfer which in turn goes with the realisation of the cherished dream of information superhighway.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In order to avoid economic isolation, Africa therefore needs to make a bold venture into the computer world for more up-to-date information. Such a move calls for the sharpening of tools for conveying information in local commerce and industry as well as for international trade and diplomacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is out this realization that 12 African countries have joined the Internet, the global information superhighway better known as the information web. This move is also seen as the determining factor in their economic survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Worldwide, there are more than 137 countries on Internet, thanks to (United States) Pentagon researchers who invented this information technology which was hitherto used exclusively by the US military in communication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the liberalisation of this technology, today Internet allows data to move from one network to another much as a letter moves from one city to another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Northern African countries like Tunisia, Egypt and Algeria had earlier access to the network because of their proximity to Europe and cultural links to the oil-rich Arab world. Other countries on the continent except perhaps for the early experiments conducted in Cote d'Ivoire until recently, have not benefitted much from this new communication technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This scenario has changed with countries in southern and eastern Africa joining the cyberspace. Last October, Kenya became the 12th country to join.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African Regional Centre for Computing (ARCC) is behind the promotion of Internet in the sub-Sahara region. It conducts research and offers training on the use of computer in communication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ARCC Director, Dr. Shem Ochuodho, says there are over 600 organizations across the region, among them some UN agencies, foreign universities, hospitals and companies which are currently on Internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Ochuodho told APS that cyberspace, a chain of electronic communication networks, has linked 3 to 4 million computers worldwide, bringing together over 40 million people, among them professionals, businessmen, academicians and administrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ARCC contends that countries that have joined the cyberspace will benefit in terms of facilitated research in various fields, obtaining required data or information, and minimising time and information transfer costs. For business men and women, transactions can be conducted electronically through the superhighway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He however regrets that Africa is not significantly connected to the superhighway. He is nevertheless optimistic that the situation might change, judging from the outcome of a meeting last June in Hawaii which resolved that the continent should forge ahead in this new communication development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting which brought together 42 Internet groups from 26 countries worldwide, issued a communique that among other issues underscored the need to have Africa connected to the communication web by early 1998. The meeting sent an appeal to African governments to provide an enabling environment for such an undertaking. It called for the reduction of tax levy on computers so that many private and public institutions can acquire them cheaply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Ochuodho observes that economic policies vary for different countries resulting in different economic growth, something he laments can be an obstacle in the growth of communication technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His pessimism is further heightened by the fact that the initial cost of establishing a computer network for information purposes can be prohibitive not only to some organisations but also governments with low economic growth.  In addition, the adaptation of this technology depends on a number of factors such as the extent to which it is acquired, adjusted and absorbed. This again depends on the size and pattern of demand for securing the technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Planning and management of the computer technology is also a very crucial factor. This means African countries should be able to plan, know how such technology can be run, have the capacity to maintain it and create awareness about its advantages in regard to economic development. Besides, there is need for a positive attitude to adapt the computer technology to national and local needs and essentially avail other infrastructure like telephones to guarantee such a network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the foregoing, those areas that have not been connected with telephones are likely to be left out in this advancement. In Africa, rural areas would thus be affected most, yet this is where the majority of the population lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ARCC principal engineer Mr. Koyabe L. Martin cautions that telephones should not be seen as a luxury but as a means to economic advancement. He notes that in Tokyo (Japan) alone, there are more telephones than in the whole of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Martin admits that the initial cost of installing the new information technology might be high but once it is in place, the viable cost is much lower as seen in some of its advantages which include many to many or one to many communication points at a go as opposed to one to one point as in telephone communication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He warns that technology can only be slowed but it can never be stopped.  Appreciating the right by authorities to hinder such technologies due to security reasons, he nevertheless warns that since information is the key to economic growth, the best governments can do is to use strategies that protect certain information from being misused.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - It is said of Daniel Comboni, that as the great missionary was saying his prayers at the close of the day in a mission in southern Sudan, a boy jumped over the wall into the mission compound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Who are you,&quot; Comboni asked they boy. &quot;I am the slave of a camel merchant,&quot; was the answer. And who sent you here?&quot; inquired Monsignor Comboni. &quot;God sent me,&quot; was the unexpected reply.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Struck by the boy's answer, Comboni is said to have granted him shelter and began to teach him; first to read and write then on to higher and more difficult things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In due time the young ex-slave was baptised, taking the name of his protector, and eventually he became the first native priest of the central African Mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This tale epitomises the mission of Catholic Bishop Daniel Comboni, founder of the missionary congregations named after him, and the man who will be beatified by Pope John Paul II on Sunday March 17, 1996 at the St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Bishop Comboni dedicated his life to spreading the Gospel of Christ, educating Africans and recruiting them from rampant slave trade</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Daniel Comboni was born in Limone on lake Garda (Brescia), Italy, on March 15, 1831. Comboni's father worked locally as a gardener, his mother, a housewife, bore eight children. Daniel was the only child to survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In February 1843, Comboni was accepted as a student at Fr. Mazza's Institute in Verona. Fr. Nicholas Mazza had set up a school for gifted children whose families could not pay for their education. In an outline of his life and work written in 1876, Comboni linked the birth of his missionary vocation with the arrival of Fr. Angelo Vinco who had spent some time in Sudan. While in Verona in search of help, Fr. Angelo gave a talk at the Mazza College.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wrote Comboni in 1849 of the lecture; &quot;I knelt at the feet of Mazza and as a student of 17 consecrated my life to work in Central Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In December 1854, Comboni was ordained priest and set out with a Mazzian missionary expedition in 1857. After a long arduous journey, they founded a mission station on the banks of the Nile about 1,6000 kilometres south of Khartoum. They called the station Holy Cross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But within months, the missionaries began to succumb to Africa's tropical diseases and the unfamiliar hot and humid climate. On March 2, 1958, the Superior Fr. Oliboni lay dying. His last words are said to have made a deep impression on the young Comboni and became his guiding star: &quot;Even if only one of you is left, don't give up. God wants this mission and the conversion of Africa to continue. I die certain of this,&quot; said Oliboni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Upon this plea, Daniel Comboni took an oath; &quot;I will never give up; Africa or death.&quot; Henceforth Africa, or death became his life-long motto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shortly after the death of their superior, the surviving missionaries were ordered to return to Europe to recuperate. Later Comboni was to make six journey to Africa and eventually establish missions, schools and training centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the heart of his mission was a &quot;Plan for the Regeneration of Africa by Africans.&quot; This in itself was a revolutionary plan. Ironically the inspiration of &quot;the Plan&quot; came to him at the same St. Peter's Basilica where he is to be beatified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This became one of the most significant events in his life and a revolutionary approach towards the evangelization of Africa. To minimise the deaths arising from disease and climate and to maximise on Africa's suitability to the African climate, Comboni envisaged a plan that would involve Africans fully in the proclamation of the gospel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His choice of the phrase &quot;regeneration of Africans&quot; had deep meaning. It was a programme full of hope and expectation, for Comboni it had to be brought about by the African people themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Regeneration of Africa by Africans had other futuristic concerns which are being understood better today such as gender sensitivity and inculturation. In his plan, African women would be trained as leaders and teachers &quot;who would promote the education of women in reading, writing, keeping accounts..&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his immense confidence in the people of Africa, as well as his determination &quot;to make available the possibility of full intellectual development for both men and women,&quot; Comboni envisaged the establishment of &quot;four great African theological - scientific universities in Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the Mazza institute decided to withdraw from the mission, Daniel Comboni felt he needed to set up his own missionary institutes. In 1867 he set the Missionary Institute for Africa, later the Comboni Missionary Sisters in 1872. He was nominated Pro- Vicar by the Holy See in 1872, then Vicar Apostolic of Central Africa in 1877 and finally ordained as the first Bishop of Central Africa in August 1877.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the greatest services that Daniel Comboni gave to Africa was his immense struggle against slave trade. At first he started by taking some of the slaves for training in Europe. In later years, Comboni was able to buy slaves being whipped as they walked along,&quot; he later wrote about an encounter with slave-caravans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The small children were carried by their mothers. Other children who were able to walk did so tied by their necks to poles resting on their shoulders so that they could not escape. Yet others, up to 15 years of age had goat skin straps around their necks which were attached to the slave traders,&quot; he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of the adults, he observed that &quot;some were chained at the feet and yet forced to carry their masters' luggage.&quot; But what hurt Comboni most was the inhuman and brutish treatment of the Africans that went along with the long treks. &quot;When the slaves were tired, they were urged along with spears and sticks. Some fell to the ground and were finished off with clubs and spears, others were left to die. Slaves were forced to march in this way for more than 12 hours a day for up to three months,&quot; he wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The slave-caravan experience filled Comboni with anger and determination to do something to stop this cruel practice. But his noble duty to Africa was not to last. On October 10, 1881 Bishop Comboni died of black fever and was later buried in Khartoum, Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following widespread reputation for holiness through his work which was continued after his death, a decision to open an informative process in Verona and Khartoum for the introduction of the cause of beatification and canonization was started in 1927.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, his work is seen in Comboni missions, schools and other training institutions which spread from Egypt down to South Africa and from Benin on the Atlantic Ocean to Kenya on the Indian Ocean. In all, there are 162 Comboni communities in Africa through 56 dioceses in 16 countries. The Comboni Sisters, on the other hand, have 136 communities in 12 countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Two professors of medicine in Kenya and Uganda, are claiming outstanding success in the treatment of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) brought about by the Human Immuno Deficiency Virus (HIV).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Professor Arthur Obel, formerly of the University of Nairobi, Kenya has previously worked as a senior scientist at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI). In an exclusive interview with a local daily on March 1, he claimed that a self-formulated drug, Pearl Omega, had proved a breakthrough in the treatment of AIDS. Dr. Obel is well known in medical research circles in Kenya, having been associated in an earlier controversial AIDS drug called KEMRON, an interferon based treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A number of patients who used the drug claimed that subsequent tests showed that their HIV status had changed from positive to negative. On that basis, they believed they were completely cured.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These patients were among hundreds of others to whom Pearl Omega had been sold since early last year, at a relatively new government institution, the Kenya Biodiversity Centre, headed by Prof. Obel. The centre's premises are in a go-down in Nairobi's Industrial Area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Carpenters were busy renovating the premises as Dr. Obel made claims of a breakthrough that has eluded scientists worldwide over the last 15 years since the virus was identified as a killer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pearl Omega is given in liquid or capsule form, several times a day. A course of treatment lasting several weeks is quite expensive by local standards - about US dollars 500. Foreigners wishing to buy the drug pay five times as much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Besides the seven patients whose documents showed they were no longer HIV positive - that they had reverted to HIV negative status, the local daily said it had talked to 31 patients in all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They claimed that once on treatment, they rapidly regained appetite and the infections associated with AIDS such as diarrhoea, pneumonia and herpes zoster rapidly abated and disappeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But no sooner had Obel claimed a breakthrough than Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi declared that as far as the government was concerned, &quot;no cure was certified discovered yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And on March 6, a Government statement cautioned Kenyans that to date there is no known cure for or vaccine against AIDS. Signed by the newly appointed Secretary to the Cabinet and Head of the Public Service Mr. Fares Kuindwa, the official statement said the Government was aware of the several drugs developed locally and internationally among them KEMRON, immunex, AZT, PCM4 and more recently Pearl Omega but urged the public to observe preventive and control measures against contracting the HIV virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moi said other scientists of proven integrity had to validate such claims. President Moi warned Kenyan's not to relax their moral standards as the disease was spreading like wildfire in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers say President Moi was not impressed by claims of a &quot;cure&quot; having been misled in 1991 by the immune system produced by living cells in response to invading organism, such as viruses. Koech and Obel claimed to be the discoverers of Low Dose Oral Interferon treatment, but it was subsequently shown that this treatment was in fact first described in the British Medical Journal, the Lancet of December 26, 1987 (page 10).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While KEMRON tablets reportedly helped a number of AIDS patients improve their quality of life, it proved generally disappointing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Neither are Prof. Obel's medical colleagues impressed by his current claims. They have challenged him to avail his Omega data for scientific scrutiny in the accepted scientific manner. They charged he was evasive and vague. Indeed the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board, through their Chairman, Prof. Richard Baraza, warned any doctors who used the drug, that they were doing so at their own risk since the side effects were not known.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Obel was developing Pearl Omega, a Ugandan doctor, Prof. Charles Ssali has treated thousands of patients with a multiple herbal pill called Mariandina. Prof. Ssali, formerly with the Faculty of Medicine, Makerere University, Kampala, claims to have treated 10,000 patients since 1992, at his clinic in the Kyotera suburbs of the Ugandan capital. He claims to have started his research in 1988.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A number of his patients claim that his herbal approach has eradicated the opportunistic infections associated with AIDS. Ssali himself claims 75 per cent of his patients have improved dramatically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He argues that AIDS is essentially a deficiency disease. A healthy life and a balanced diet are a real barrier to HIV infections. Like an increasing number of doctors in the West, he asserts that minerals like zinc enable the thymus gland in the chest to produce enzymes and hormones which activate cells within the lymphatic system, which in turn become &quot;killer cells&quot; against incoming invaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He says drinking alcohol is a bad habit that compounds the problem of HIV in Uganda. Dr. Ssali says his AIDS medicine is formulated from 18 natural compounds. These compounds provide vital micronutrients or serve as anti-oxidants which all play a role in ensuring that pollutants do not adversely affect the immune system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Uganda's Health Minister, Dr. James Makumbi, remains skeptical. Late last year, he cautioned Dr. Ssali against using the media to propagate his findings. &quot;The best forum are medical journals like the East African Medical Journal,&quot; said Makumbi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prof. Ssali wondered why he was being taken to task on the basis that his drug had not been tested on animals. He wanted Dr. Makumbi to explain why foreign companies were testing AIDS vaccines in Uganda without going through similar procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also reminded Dr. Makumbi and many younger doctors in Uganda, that they owe their medical skills to the knowledge he imparted to them while teaching at the Faculty of Medicine at Makerere University in the 70s and 80s.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Massive food loss from infestation with insects such as weevils, infestation with micro-organisms such as aflatoxin or other parasites could become a thing of the past if African nations used irradiation technology for the preservation of food. The technology is now widely accepted in the West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Experts say food loss from insect infestation alone - post harvest storage losses - costs African nations more than 40 per cent of all its agricultural production.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But food loss from insect infestation is only one of the problems, says Susan Thorp, a development advocate with WREN World Radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Hot, humid conditions prevalent in the tropics mean that many more foods like meat, milk, fish or fruit will deteriorate within a few hours or days, while premature sprouting of tubers and other crops are also major obstacles to keeping foods fresh, wholesome and attractive,&quot; says Ms Thorp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa does not have resources for largescale application of many costly technologies like refrigeration or freezing of dry of foods. Consequently, large scale treatment of food to kill insects and prolong shelf life has traditionally been with chemicals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Ms Thorp observes: &quot;lingering residues and environmental consideration are forcing the search for alternatives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many African nations have problems with insect infestation of cash crops such as cocoa beans, coffee beans or maize. &quot;Insects may even prevent or cause difficulties for potential export to other countries. In Ghana, 60 per cent of foreign exchange is generated by the export of cocoa beans alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She observes that at present, the beans are fumigated with ethyl- bromide &quot;a chemical that is now being phased out due to environmental pressure because of its effects on the Ozone layer (in the atmosphere).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Thorp advocates strongly that food be preserved by irradiation techniques in Africa. This technology is relatively cheap and fully accepted in the United States and many countries in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Irradiation of food is based on the use of ionising energy from such sources as cobalt-6 as well as electron and x-ray machines adjusted to proper energy levels so they can kill insects, micro organisms and other food robbing creatures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is suitable for cereals, vegetables, fruits, tubers, fish, meat and many other foods produced in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Thorp says African nations which wish to use these technology can find all the help they need from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arua, Uganda - The Catholic Bishop of Arua in northwestern Uganda, has lamented that some Catholic priests have breached their celibacy vows and in the process fathered children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishop Fredrick Drandua told a seminar in Arua town on March 3, that priests intent on marrying can be allowed to do so in church if they renounce their priesthood and get the Pope's permission to marry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The matter began when a participant in a seminar on &quot;Counselling, probationary services and the penal system in Uganda,&quot; sought to find out from Bishop Drandua how children fathered by priests can get to know their father as is the right of any child.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bishop explained at length, according to the state-owned daily New Vision account of the proceedings of the seminar; &quot;If a priest gets a child, he is suspended from carrying out activities of the church for an indefinite period. When he reforms, he is allowed to return - but only after he has made comprehensive arrangements with the parents of the girl or woman for the upkeep and care of his child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishop Drandua conceded that priests had been dismissed altogether when they continued to get children after the first pardon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also explained that children born out of wedlock - the term illegitimate children is going out of fashion - cannot seek to join the seminary &quot;except with the permission of the bishop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, a Kenyan daily, the East African Standard reports in its issue of March 4, that a Catholic priest is at the centre of a row with his congregation who claim he has broken his celibacy vows and all church norms by allegedly getting married.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Catholic faithful from Limuru parish, some 30 kilometres from the capital, Nairobi, charged that the priest had constructed a house for his wife adjacent to the church compound. They considered this act a betrayal of the accepted norms of the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Sunday, March 3, the congregation staged a peaceful demonstration demanding the removal of the priest from the area. They waved placards, tree branches as they sang church hymns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of the demonstrators claimed they had presented detailed grievances in a letter to the local Deanery and the Archbishop of Nairobi, Maurice Cardinal Otunga.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Windhoek - Zambian lawyer, Mr. Sakwiba Sikota, says he intends to challenge the Speaker of the National Assembly in Zambia, Dr. Robinson Nabulyato for the indefinite imprisonment of his clients - two newspaper editors of the controversial independent bi-weekly The Post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking to the Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA) here on March 6, Mr. Sikota, argued that the procedures used by the Speaker, Dr. Nabulyato to order the arrest of, and to pass sentence on Fred M'Membe, the Post's Editor-in-Chief, the Managing Editor Bright Mwape and columnist Lucy Sichone, has no backing under the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His challenge, is expected to heard on March 12 under a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MISA further says, the two Zambian editors, whom the Speaker of the National Assembly, Dr. Nabulyato jailed indefinitely after finding them guilty of contempt of parliament on February 27, handed themselves to the police on March 4, while their colleague, Sichone, is still lying low.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;M'Membe and Mwape did hand themselves in to the police this morning, March 4, while Sichone, a civic activist and freelance columnist for the paper, is still at large,&quot; disclosed MISA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to MISA M'Membe had been sent to a maximum security prison in the Zambian capital, Lusaka, while Mwape was driven to Kabwe, 150 kilometres away where he too is said to have been imprisoned in a maximum security jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the writ of habeas corpus application, the parliament will be required to justify on what law or authority it is holding M'Membe and Mwape in prison, Lawyer Sikota told MISA. He added that if the court was not satisfied with the reasons given, it would order the immediate release of the trio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Mr. Sikota, M'Membe and Mwape were expected to be present during the proceedings this week on March 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing himself to Section 27 of the National Assembly Powers and Privileges Act, under which his clients have been jailed, Mr. Sikota argued that the sentence passed by the Speaker was not provided for in the 1956 Act.  He further explained that once parliament had found someone in contempt, the matter should be handed over to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was the DPP's duty, and not that of the parliament, to prosecute, Mr.  Sikota further stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an earlier interview with Namibian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC), Mr. Sikota said his clients had never been put on trial, and had been found &quot;guilty&quot; by parliament in absentia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is totally against all the rules of natural justice, argued Mr.  Sikota, stressing that &quot;everyone is entitled to be tried by an impartial tribunal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the case of M'Membe, Mwape and Sichone, Vice-President Godfrey Miyanda (who raised the contempt issue when the Post trio wrote about his criticism of a Supreme Court ruling that legislation requiring police permission for the holding of demonstrations was unconstitutional), and Dr.  Nabulyato &quot;played the part of accusers, prosecutors, judge and jury,&quot; lamented Mr. Sokoto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But lawyer Sikota was confident the courts will order the release of his clients on grounds of the constitution. The case had brought a &quot;mini constitutional crisis,&quot; he argued, adding that the courts will have to over-rule the National Assembly, as the legislative authority has obviously gone way beyond its bounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Once a court rules that they (Mwape and M'Membe) are being held illegally, the prison authorities will have to release them, he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And speaking on Sichone's decision not to hand herself in, Mr. Sikota told NBC: &quot;Sichone's position is that she cannot be party to what she clearly sees as an illegal act and answer to a warrant (for her arrest) with no constitutional backing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He explained that Sichone had a three-month-old baby and so she was not willing to subject the baby to the &quot;terrible conditions&quot; found in Zambia's prisons, where cholera was prevalent at this time of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile Zambia's Home Affairs Minister Chitalu Sampa, says M'Membe and Mwape &quot;should be treated like ordinary criminals&quot; while in jail, the state-owned Times of Zambia reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sampa reportedly made the remarks to the imprisoned editors. &quot;A prisoner is a prisoner and there is no special treatment,&quot; Mr. Sampa was reported saying. The Minister added that M'Membe and Mwape were not political prisoners.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Freetown - The rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) has repeated its opposition to the general elections held in Sierra Leone late last month, saying it will not recognise any winner of a run-off slated for March 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Presidential and parliamentary elections were held on February 26 and 27, the first multi-party poll for nearly 20 years, but the electoral commission said they will have to go into a second round because none of the candidates emerged the outright winner. The exercise was intended to end four years of military rule and to negotiate a peaceful end to five years of civil war in the West African state.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;None of the candidates obtained the 55 per cent requirement as set out by decree and the constitution. As a result there will have to be a run-off,&quot; the head of the Interim National Electoral Commission (INEC), Mr. James Jonah, is quoted as saying in a broadcast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rebels had threatened to make the country totally ungovernable and insecure should the elections go ahead, and they were marred by violence, mainly in the capital, Freetown, the north, and the southeastern town of Bo, where several people are reported to have been killed by unidentified attackers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Against the background of violence, said the electoral commission, Sierra Leoneans turned out in large numbers to vote, pushing polling into a second day. However, civilians charged that the RUF threat was carried out, ironically, by elements of the army who did not want a democratic change rather than the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soon after the latest results were announced, an RUF spokesman told the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in an interview that the rebel movement will not recognise any winner because the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> elections were meaningless, with civil war still raging in the country.  He said an end to the war must be sought and a new process involving all Sierra Leoneans, including traditional and local leaders, set into motion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Giving full results of the presidential and general elections, Mr. Jonah said the leader of the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP), which is the country's oldest, won the most votes but not enough for an outright victor.  Ahmad Tajan Kabbah of the SLPP won 35.8 per cent of the votes and will face his closest rival, John Karefa-Smart of the United National People's Party (UNPP), who received 22.6 per cent in the run-off on March 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Talks aimed at ending the civil war were held on the eve of the elections between the rebels and the military government of Brigadier Julius Maada Bio in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, but broke off inconclusively. They resumed on March 3, but were again suspended for consultation. No new date has been set for the resumption of talks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monrovia - The Interim Government in Liberia has announced the sacking of United Liberation Movement of Liberia - Johnson faction (Ulimo-J) leader, Roosevelt Johnson, as Minister for Rural Development, because a dispute within his organisation has threatened the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But immediately the announcement was made, Johnson challenged it, arguing that the other members of the Transitional State Council, including Charles Taylor of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), George Boley of the Liberia Peace Council (LPC), and Alhaji Kromah of Ulimo-K, had no powers to dismiss him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He charged that under the Abuja Peace Accord signed last August, all members of the State Council had equal status and therefore, no one member could be dismissed by the others.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Making the announcement on Monrovia radio, an interim government statement, quoted by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) said the decision was taken because recent developments within John's Krahn wing of the Ulimo threatened to derail the peace process. The government also issued a warrant to search John's premises in Monrovia for weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On March 2, senior members of Ulimo-J announced that they had fired Johnson accusing him of losing control over the fighters. They also said Johnson was responsible for recent fighting between troops of the West African peacekeeping force ECOMOG, and those of Ulimo-J in Tubmanburg, northwestern Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the fighting, about 60 ECOMOG troops, mainly from the Nigerian contingent, were reportedly killed, together with scores of civilians caught in the cross-fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johnson has since said he was still in charge as Ulimo-J leader and described those who announced his ouster as disgruntled members of the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, fighters from the LPC are said to have gone on the rampage in the port city of Buchanan, killing two people and wounding several others.  Reports say angry civilians had mounted road-blocks to track down members of a rebel group, whose vehicle knocked down and killed a teenage girl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The LPC group then retreated and returned with reinforcement, armed with assault rifles and opened fire on the unarmed civilians. The bodies of those killed in the shooting and that of the teenage girl were put on display, with angry demonstrators pleading with the Ghanaian contingent of ECOMOG based in Buchanan, to take stern action and stop the rebels from bringing arms into town.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - Liver disease, resulting directly from infection with the Hepatitis B virus, and indirectly through cancer and cirrhosis, &quot;is the fourth largest cause of death in the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. J. Jensen of the American Liver Foundation has warned that the impact of Hepatitis B in public health is generally underrated, particularly in Africa, where as many as 10 per cent of the population are carriers of Hepatitis B. &quot;In some countries in Africa, like Mozambique, as many as 20 per cent of the population may be carriers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Carriers do not have symptoms and require a blood test to verify infection with Hepatitis B or C. These two types are the more common and contagious varieties, says Jensen. Carriers are still susceptible to cancer.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He explained that Hepatitis A is spread mainly through water contaminated with sewage. It is generally considered less dangerous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hepatitis B and C are spread through contaminated blood, unsterilised hospital equipment and sexual intercourse, the same mode of transmission as the HIV virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, among the Karimojong people of north-eastern Uganda, the cultural tattooing of the body has been identified as a major avenue for the transmission of Hepatitis B.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Karimojong are nomadic pastoralists who occupy a large chunk of land in northeastern Uganda. The area is considered the least developed in the country. The local people engage in regular cattle rustling. Famines caused by droughts are quite common.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Mathew Emer of Matany Hospital in Karimoja, told the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Resident Representative in Uganda, Dr. Babatunde Thomas that the reason Hepatitis B was prevalent in Karimoja is partly because the people used the same razor blade while tattooing their bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On HIV/AIDS, Dr. Emer said the prevalence of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) was considered low three years ago, but recent statistics had shown a steep rise. For example, hospital records at Matany showed that only 2.5 per cent of mothers attending ante-natal clinics had HIV in 1993. This figure had risen to 7.5 per cent by late 1995 - a 300 per cent increase.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - The head of the Nigerian Catholic Bishops' (CBCN) Conference Albert Obiefuna has charged that Nigeria was in &quot;great distress&quot; and urged the clergy to prevail upon the country's military leader Sani Abacha to alleviate the people's misery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing a CBCN meeting on February 28, Bishop Obiefuna called for a &quot;well-worded and courteous&quot; memorandum on the sufferings of the people to be handed to the Head of State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishop Obiefuna singled out the deteriorating security situation in Nigeria and the plight of &quot;thousands of prisoners languishing in jails without trial&quot; as some of Nigeria's most pressing proclaims.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigerian authorities have clamped down hard on political opponents since the military regime annulled the results of the 1993 general elections which publishing magnate Moshood Abiola claimed to have won.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola was subsequently arrested and charged with treason after he declared himself president and is still being held in jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishop Obiefuna also appealed to his colleagues to condemn what he called &quot;shameful acts&quot; of Nigerian girls allegedly engaging in prostitution in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Authorities here recently ordered the arrest of three Italian embassy officials over allegations that they had received bribes from some 500 Nigerian women to issue visas to them to travel to Italy to practise prostitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The military administrator of Lagos state, Colonel Olagunsoye Oyiniola, who also attended the bishops' meeting, appealed to the clergymen to promote moral growth and religious tolerance in the west African country, which has experienced outbreaks of violent clashes between Christians and Muslims in the recent past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He urged Roman Catholics to pray for the government's three-year democratisation programme, which is being implemented in phases, and will culminate in the military handing over power to an elected civilian government on October 1, 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Answering Colonel Oyinlola's appeal, the Archbishop of Ibadan, Alaba Job, prayed that; &quot;Your government will ease the burden of the people and bring about peace and tranquility to Nigeria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile security forces have prevented the staging of a play by exiled Nobel literature laureate and human rights activist Wole Soyinka, and arrested two theatre directors in Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organisers of the performance said security agents went to a government school where Soyinka's play &quot;Trials of Brother Jero&quot; was being staged on February 29 and ordered the performance stopped before arresting two of the directors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The directors were taken to the headquarters of the state security service where they were interrogated on their motive of staging the play.  They were later released but ordered to report to the police virtually every day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soyinka is an outspoken critic of Nigeria's military regime. He recently described Abacha as a &quot;stone-age despot&quot; who intends to cling to power for as long as possible.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - Kenya Airways said it would sell 235 million shares, 51 percent of its shareholding, on the Nairobi Stock Exchange in the biggest flotation since the bourse opened up in 1954.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The airline said in a statement that the share offer would begin on March 25 and remain open for four weeks to April 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenya Airways Managing Director Brian Davies said the offer was the second phase of a privatisation after the January sale of 26 percent of the airline to Dutch national carrier KLM for $26 million (UShs 26bn).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Kenyan government will retain 23 percent of the airline. &quot;The government will be offering approximately 235 million shares for sale.  Further details, including the price of the shares, will be announced at a later date,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The flotation will enable all interested Kenyans to participate in the future success of our national airline and ensure that majority of the shares are held by Kenyan citizens,&quot; the statement added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NSE estimated that each share would cost 12 shillings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Initially, Kenya Airways staff were supposed to acquire three percent of the airline but the Monday statement made no reference to them, suggesting staff had ceded that privilege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign investors in the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE) are allowed to buy up to 40 percent of the shares of local concerns. Davies had previously said foreign investors would be permitted to purchase up to 14 percent of Kenya Airways stock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Kenyan public and institutions would take the balance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenya Airways made a profit of 450 million shilligs ($7.7 million) in 1993, the first since its launch in 1977. But the airline is weighed down with debts totalling $15.35 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Profits rose to 868 million shillings and the government said it would take over its outstanding debts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenya Airways has eight aircrafts--three Airbus A310's, three Fokker 50's and two Boeing 737's. It has a work force of 2,400, reduced from 3,500 in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to Kenya Airways, the Kenyan government has listed 42 other public companies for privatisation this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NSE, with a capitalisation of $1.75 billion, is the fourth largest bourse in Africa but accounts but accounts for only one percent of the entire share market. The Johannesburg Stock Exchange still tops in Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - At a total of 552,532 bags for January, valued at US $50.2 million (Shs 50bn), Uganda has recorded the highest shipment ever in a single month since the early 80's. But uncertainty in the direction of international prices and the growing influence of pre-finance by external banks continue to lower profits in the local market.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Uganda Coffee Development Authority (UCDA) report for January says that although international prices remain high, local farmers are earning comparitively less than during the same period last coffee year. The January price of between Shs 600-700 Kiboko (unprocessed coffee) and Shs 1,300-1,450 per Kg for FAQ (processed coffee)compare unfavorably with last year's prices of 800-1000 and 1800-2000 respectively during the same period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A 1995 World Bank report paints a gloomy picture of the Uganda coffee market and predicted a continued drop in profits. The report that Ugandan financial instituitions, especially Uganda Commercial Bank (UCB), are losing the coffee processing and marketing business to off-shore banks. 45 percent of an estimated Ug Shs 75 billion obtained for coffee purchasing and marketing was provided by non-Ugandan banks. The World Bank report says Ugandan farmers were driven to foreign banks by high real interest rates charged by domestic banks. It notes that as international prices drop competition from off-shore sources, it will have a more powerful effect on demand for funds in the local market, leading to a decline in margins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A UCDA source said that the World Bank's gloomy predictions are credible, but said in the short run international pre-financing provides healthy competition in the market and prompt payment for farmers. According to a yet to be published UCDA document, following the liberalisation of the coffee market, over 80 percent of coffee finance is pre-financed by foreign financial institutions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Speaker of the National Assembly, Robbinson Nabulyato, in late February sentenced Post managing director and editor-in-chief Fred Mm'embe, managing editor Bright Mwape, and columnist Lucy Sichone, to indefinite imprisonment for breach of parliamentary privileges and gross contempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three were found &quot;guilty of libelling and publishing inflamatory and conteptous remarks, contempt and libel, and wantonly contemptuous of the dignity of the house, the speaker and the leader of the house&quot; respectively.  We reproduce in full what they wrote in their respective columns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fred's Dairy - by Fred M'membe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week Vice-President Godfrey Miyanda, legal affairs minister Remmy Mushota, and energy deputy minister Ernest Mwansa opened a vicious attack in parliament on the Supreme Court for declaring sections 5 (4) and 7 (a) of the Public Order Act unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vice-President Miyanda and other ruling MMD officials have every right to feel disappointed with the Supreme Court's ruling on the Public Order Act as it was a treasured political weapon in their hands.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They used the restrictive laws not only to stop anti-government protests but also to harass and humiliate their political opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Act enabled MMD officials to hold meetings at very short notice as they did not, in most cases, require police permits as most of their top party officials are also ministers. And the police is under the control and direction of those who are in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Supreme Court's ruling has, in some very big way, levelled the political play field in so far as mass mobilisation through political meetings is concerned. The ruling MMD has indeed lost some political advantage. And looking at the way the MMD officials are reacting to the Supreme Court judgment loss must have been gigantic - the bigger the advantage the greater the resistance to losing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miyanda missed point over writers attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Behind the scene - by Bright Mwape</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I FEEL let down yet again by the conduct of Vice-President Brigadier general Godfrey Miyanda. When he went promo and starred in Victor Oladukun Tunnel and Torture 'advert' on CBN, I thought it was for sheer want of leisure-time off whatever you can imagine keeps him busy in the veeps office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But I thought he was totally of tangent on Tuesday when he went to cry before the speaker of the national assembly that he be protected from the arrogance and cheek of writers like Fred M'membe and Lucy Sichone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not that any generals don't cry. The generals must be allowed to cry and weep. It's normal. As one philosopher once put it, &quot;even the fish cry's only the water retains its glitter of confidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But not even that is my issue. Miyanda let me down for failing to distinguish between an office as an institution and the individual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He failed to read the principle of the people's disgust at his fellow MMD cohorts attack is that these are injuring the greater integrity of the office of the chief justice and the judiciary in general. The gist of the public outburst including the high sounding Lucy Sichone and Fred M'membe attacks was less intended at curtailing Miyanda's freedom of speech as of reminding him that when he takes on the judiciary in that manner Zambians have a duty to rise to its defence because it is their last hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What the people are saying regardless of their affiliation is that the chief justice should be left alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their concern is their wider implication of calls for his removal let alone the Miyanda backed attempt to go round his judgement and retain exactly what the judiciary ruled against.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miyanda as a politican must know that he has had demonstrable 'privileges' even illicit ones, to protect him from so many verbal and written attacks inspite of his blunders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When he and other politicians are injured by my writing they should run to the 'Chief Justice' and try hard to use that institution to sqeeeze me into jail or drain my pocket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even when that fails the Miyanda's would summon their security to survet, haras and intimidate me. If that is too indirect I would be clobbered by thugs of party cadres who have never known the word 'reason' in their life time. They would not be arrested or charged because they are protecting the President or is it the 'power.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now I learn the Miyanda's can even abuse parliament to add to their list of protectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If you add to this physical bodly guards, guns, alarms, sirens, cars and other you would understand Miyanda's shock when all this fails to hold the sharp edge of Lucy and Fred's writing from piercing his heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But when all this is their's have the Miyanda's in their plural, thought about who is there to protect the more important institution when it turns freedom of assembly from a previledge of the Miyanda's to a right of over eight million people?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The protection of the intergrity of that institution will not be left to today's holder of that office, Mathew Ngulube. It is not his issue. Infact Ngulube should not even waste his time answering back the Miyanda's. We the people, whose institution that s, will rise to its defence at whatever risk to ourselves. It is for our benefit. Not even parliament will hold us back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thats why those in the judiciary getting compromised will not equally receive our support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Therefore Mr. Speaker Sir, I rise on a counter point of order. You have an obligation to recognise that you are ruling on an issue which goes beyond M'membe and Sichone. It is one of the people versus the executive over the independence of the judiciary. Are the Miyanda's in order? I beg to move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miyanda has forgotten about need for justice!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lucy on Monday - by Lucy Sichone</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vice-President Godfrey Miyanda is alive and addressed by his title of Brigadier General because of the courage and integrity of a few men in thejudiciary who defied KK to ensure that justice was done when he was arraigned on a treason charge of which he was not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miyanda cannot have forgotten the courage of one judge who refused to sit and hear his case until his jailers removed the chains with which he was shackled in the court room. Miyanda could not have foregotten that in the circumstances of the Second Republic, it took men of courage and integrity to acquit him of a crime for which the government decreed him guilty. Yet KK even in cases such as that of Miyanda where courageous judges dispensed justice in defiance of his wishes, never abused a one-party rubber stamp parliament to attack the decisions of those judges who risked their necks for Miyanda's constitutional rights to equality, justice and protection of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In view of this, Miyanda's condemnation of the courage and integrity of the Supreme Court judgment which merely applied Article 1 (2) of the Constitution which reads &quot;This Constitution is the supreme law of Zambia and if any other law is inconsistent with this Constitution, that other law shall to the extent of the inconsistency be void&quot; was cheap, false and cowardly.  Miyanda's statement was cheap and false because Section 7 of the Public Order Act was declared void only to the extent where the exercise of the right to assembly could be enjoyed at the discretion of a policeman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The requirement for the police to maintain law and order at any assembly still remains in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was a cowardly statement because he could only attack a decision made by men of the stature, dignity and integrity of Mathew Ngulube from behind the protective skirts of grand mother Nabulyato. I have no doubt that Miyanda being a devout Christian had in mind the parable of the unmerciful servant whose many debts were forgiven but who withheld the same kind of mercy shown to him from his debtors and had them thrown in prison. The Bible says that when the master who had forgiven his servant heard what he had done, he had the unmerciful servant thrown into prison for not extending the same kind of justice shown to him by his master to his debtors. Miyanda is depending on Nabulyato to save him from the natural consequences of his actions and soothe his conscience. What hypocrisy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Miyanda was an honest man he could not have lined political violence which is being fanned by himself to the decision of the Supreme Court. And by the way the re-enactment of the POA will not solve the problem of its invalidity by Article (2) of the Constitution and as long as we have individual judges of courage and integrity, such a law will not stand. The veep will just have to be a man enough and abolish the bill of rights as it exists in the Constitution and rule in the manner everyone, including his colleagues in the MMD know he would like to rule - as a Christian Abacha. For as someone said of Lyndon Johnson &quot;One cannot imagine an act so small that he would not commit it, nor words so hollow that he would not utter them. He is a crescendo of hypocrisy and pettiness who has managed to congeal in one personality the worst elements of man's most honoured traits. He is capable of anger but not passion, he is pious without being religious, tough without being brave, sincere without honesty and vain without pride.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As for the honourable MPs who called for the removal of Mathew Ngulube from his job, I can only advise that individuals of the calibre of the current Chief Justice do not depend on the trappings of office to be heroes.  They are heroes because of what they are and not what they do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I know that this is difficult to understand in a country where there are no heroes, no role models, where honour and integrity are conspicuous by their absence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ngulube, outside the CJ's office would still command the same kind of respect that would compel most of us in need of a role model, guidance and just old fashioned advice to seek him out and and learn from his experience.  The assumption here of course is that he has always been and continues to turn down consultancies and offers of jobs from around the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commonwealth and USA in order to help those of us who benefit from his wealth of legal knowledge and plain common sense. Further, I know that it is a trait of human nature to judge others by our own standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consequently, those who measure their wealth by their job description, believe that all persons depend on their positions for some measure of stature, respectability and dignity. In fact it is the other way round; it is inherent integrity of the person that vests an office with qualities of respectability, integrity and dignity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The current leadership crisis has been brought about by a critical shortage of men and women capable of imparting honour, integrity and dignity to their offices whether it be in judiciary, executive, legislature, civil service, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the circumstances, it is absolutely necessary that I pay tribute and salute Justices Ngulube, Muzyamba and Sakala in their capacities as human beings, because it is the qualities of their humanity that is reflected in that landmark judgement which shall be forever cherished by all freedom and peace loving Zambians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miyanda's court ruling 'justified' - what will replacing the Public Order Act mean?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last Thursday Vice-President Miyanda, who is also the leader of the House, told parliament they will make another law in the place of the lost Public Order Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We will make amendments to see that sense comes to the law so that we don't have anarchy,&quot; Vice-President Miyanda told parliament last Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The courts should have cast their nets wider and looked at the wider implications of their judgements.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But what does this mean? Doesn't it mean bringing back another Public Order Act under a different name? What are the implications of all this if it is effected? Does it undermine or strengthen the separation of powers?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Vice-President Miyanda is not the only top government official attacking the Supreme Court and it's judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Legal minister Remmy Mushota, who seems to be living only for today with little interest in tomorrow, has gone beyond criticising the Supreme Court judgment to attacking the political affiliations of the individual judges, of course in a cowardly manner - without giving names or elaborating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last Wednesday Mushota told parliament that judges should refrain from political party membership because this would clout their judgments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When the judiciary set a political platform in their judgments they risk antagonising the legislature,&quot; Mushota told the house. &quot;Any attempt by anyone to use the bench for legislation would land them into trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Energy deputy minister Ernest Mwansa accused the Supreme Court of imitating what happens in other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The problem is that people imitate what happens in other countries like the United States,&quot; Mwansa told parliament last Wednesday. &quot;It is possible for people to demonstrate without permits in the United States because there were enough policemen to deal with the crowds which was not the case in Zambia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whereas I agree with Mushota that the judiciary is not the legislature, I believe the High Court and the Supreme Court has power to declare acts of parliament unconstitutional. This is not equivalent to &quot;using the bench for legislation&quot;, as Mushota claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What seems to be clear now is that the executive doesn't seem to accept, in practice rather than in theory, the separation, or indeed the sharing of, power among the three arms of the state - the executive, judiciary, and legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Zambia, as matters stand today, the independence of the legislature is not more than a theoretical ideal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The executive controls and directs parliament. The leader of the house, the Vice-President and the man who lead the attacks on the Supreme Court judgment in parliament, is the number two man in the executive. The majority of the members of the legislature are executive officials. The executive determines who should be speaker and deputy speaker. The composition and character of this parliament is of very little practical significance in the separation of powers. It is purely symbolic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And having taken over the functions of parliament, the executive has become excessively greedy and would also like to interpret the Constitution and all other laws, taking over judiciary functions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is common knowledge that some judicial officers, at various levels, have offered themselves to the service of those in charge of the executive.  They consult and brief members of the executive in all matters in which they think they have an interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judicial officers who were seen to be supporters, or ruled in favour, of the MMD were rewarded with promotions after the change of government. These favour-seekers are not even ashamed to allege that those who rule against the MMD and government have political affiliations with the opposition or former president Kenneth Kaunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But these are not the judicial officers Mushota is concerned about, because they always, in material matters, rule in favour of the ruling MMD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The MMD government, like it does with everyone who refuses to toe it's line or takes an independent position, is trying to discredit Chief Justice Matthew Ngulube, Justice Weston Muzyamba, and Justice Ernest Sakala as being supporters of some opposition parties. And if these belong to the opposition, and since no person can be independent in this country, it will be interesting to know which political party deputy Chief Justice Bonaventure Bweupe and Justice Chaila belong to. It is certainly not an opposition party!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is the some total of Mushota's insinuations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But if the Supreme Court can be said to be so weakly constituted what type of justice can those involved in legal battles in magistrate courts with a president expect to get. If the Chief Justice can be harangued in parliament in that way what more a mere magistrate or an ordinary High Court judge? These may probably explain why two High Court judges, Lombe Chibesakunda and David Lewanika, who enjoy some considerable respect as human rights judges, opted not to rule against the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As for Mwansa's claims that &quot;the problem is that people imitate what happens in other countries like the United States&quot;, the deputy minister forgot that the parliament he was talking from is an imitation, the suit, shirt, necktie, shoes, pair of socks, underwears and the wrist watch he was putting on are imitations. The Speaker's robe is an imitation from England.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Constitution of the Republic of Zambia and its bill of rights is an imitation. There is no need to labour much on this, the best thing for Mwansa would be to shut up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is clear that there are some serious separation of powers deficiencies in our system of government, but we should not allow it to be weakened further by wicked men, because, as we have seen, it does to some extent provide an important safeguard against the potential abuse of power by the executive.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Serving a jail sentence can be a traumatic experience. But for female inmates in one of Zimbabwe's jails, prison life has also turned into a learning forum where they have acquired skills that enable them try new job outlets upon release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most female inmates never see a judge or magistrate again. Chikurubi female prison in north-eastern Zimbabwe, near the capiutal Harare is now turning out qualified women who upon being freed are becoming useful members of a society that once frowned upon their deeds. Gweru is the only other women's prison in this southern African countrty.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just 10 per cent of women prisoners in Zimbabwe come before the courts again after their release, suggesting that women are far more likely than men to reform in jail. Also a significant number of women are in jail for infanticide and baby dumping, two offences that hardly anyone commits more than once and which few prospective employers will hold against a job applicant otherwise considered suitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Therefore, training for the employment market upon release usually makes very good sense for women prisoners and since most committed the crime that sent them to prison from need or desperation, such training is the best way of ensuring that they never see a judge or magistrate again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The present sophisticated training project was initiated by Lady Melhuish, the wife of a former British High Commissioner to Zimbabwe in 1985.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although not the best place to be, some serving inmates feel they have achieved more inside than they would have while outside and that they are far better equipped for life. They have taken prison as a second chance to learn how to lead a decent and honest life on their release. Some are now even running classes as they work out their term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When working out how she could help the women prisoners, Lady Melhuish came up with the idea of a training centre and discussed it with the Commissioner of Prisons, Mr. Langton Chigwida, who gave her the go-ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lady Melhuish, who had taught secretarial skills before, volunteered to take part of her time to teach willing prisoners secretarial skills without asking for any payment or assistance from the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the help of her husband, Sir Ramsay Melhuish, Lady Melhuish managed to source donations of typewriters and books from British business people and banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commissioner, Mr. Chigwada, also contributed to the success of the project by building a room at the prison premises where up to today lessons are being conducted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview at the Chikurubi Female Maximum Security Prison, Lady Melhuish said her wish was for the inmates to get employment when they leave jail. She briefly stopped running the project in 1989 when her husband was posted outside this southern African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But during her two-year absence, she arranged for those prisoners who had been with her for a long time and had already passed their advanced examinations to run the classes with the help of prison officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Although it was difficult for them to run the project during my absence they managed to pull through and when I came back, I phoned the Commissioner and was given the permission to take over again. We get a lot of help from people donating second-hand typewriters but we have never had a regular source of income,&quot; she told this writer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Lady Melhuish, a charitable organisation, Oak Zimbabwe Foundation, gave them goods worth over Zimbabwe dollars 50,000 (US dollars 5,000) after visiting the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most ex-prisoners who were once in Lady Melhuish's class are now breadwinners for their families. The project could also decrease the number of female offenders most of whom turn to crime because of lack of employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The examination results have also been overwhelming. The first 11 students passed, with 10 of them obtaining first-class passes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lady Melhuish says there are currently 21 students who will be joined by four prison officers, expected to later join the training class so that they could spread the project in other prisons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked why the project only benefited female offenders, Lady Melhuish said: &quot;I honestly believe that the majority of women are in prison for economic reasons, mostly because they will be trying to fend for their children. But with enough resources we might consider setting a similar project for male offenders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She added that most women were willing to learn and everyday there were more eager to join the class. But because of lack of space and few facilities they are turned down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Diana Musa (32) and Viola Hakata who are both serving jail sentences for theft, felt that the project was useful as it would help to improve their lives outside. Already the pair have obtained two certificates each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Agnes Samoto, who is in for fraud, the unpleasant side of prison life does not put her down so much for the project keeps her mind occupied.  Samoto, who by the beginning of this year still had two months of her sentence remaining, said she hoped to get a job with the qualifications acquired in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others whom APS spoke to said although they already had the secretarial skills, the project helped to refresh their minds. However, they were all grateful to Lady Melhuish for her devotion. &quot;She is a very nice woman,&quot; said Agnes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Peace seems as elusive as ever all over the world. In Africa, the search for peace continues as various countries are faced with civil wars that somehow seem endless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A resource person commenting about the threat facing the ordinary world as a result of conflict says; &quot;If an anthropological expedition from another galaxy arrived on earth today, it would surely be impossible for them to give a rational explanation of human behaviour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;How would they explain that we spend 250 times more on arms than we do on peacekeeping? What would they say about the 22 million people killed in wars since 1945? About the fact that 84 per cent of those killed were civilians, compared to 50 per cent of casualties in the Second World War?  About the 24 million people forced to flee and become displaced people within their own countries, and the 18 million who have become refugees abroad, all as a result of conflict?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Writing a foreword to The Cost of Conflict, a 1994 Earthscan publication summarizing case studies of conflicts worldwide, Rt. Hon. Lord Judd of Portsea, also notes that so much of the work done to raise the quality of life of our fellow human beings is frustrated and negated by conflict.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Says Lord Judd in the 1994 publication that tries to evaluate the costs and benefits of conflicts; &quot;In my six years as Director of (British charity) Oxfam, our priority was, as it is now, long term development. But over 50 per cent of Oxfam's work was in areas of conflict. In Africa, 70 per cent of our work was war-related...In the 1990s all the relief and development agencies are grappling with humanitarian suffering and death, in what Oxfam has called &quot;a decade of disasters.&quot; Judd has since retired from the British charity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead of promoting independence and development, most of Africa's efforts and external aid today are being channeled to deal with the collapse of civil society and economic destruction. Even programmes initially earmarked for other developmental activities such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) are now directing their much needed resources to resolving conflict and settling conflict victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These disasters are graphically demonstrated by the number of people being forced to flee their homes in circumstances which involve untold human suffering. A half of Africa's estimated 20 million people said to be presently displaced from their homes have been forced to flee as a result of conflict.  The rest have been compelled to leave by hunger and rural poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mozambique's 30-year-old war covering the pre-independence period (before 1974) up to the end of the post-independence civil war in 1992, was responsible for the displacement of some 5 million people internally and another 1.7 million into neighbouring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the Sudan, as a result of on-going civil war since 1983, over six million people have reportedly been displaced. Some 5000,000, mostly civilians have died whereas up to one million have been injured as a direct result of the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many refugees have been created from civil wars. An official at the United Nations High Commissioner</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> for Refugees (UNHCR) in Nairobi, says that even when humanely treated, the refugee still feels humiliated, no longer in control of his destiny and at the mercy of others. This undoubtedly generates anger and a feeling of helplessness,&quot; said the UN officer who chose anonymity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The disruptions occasioned by conflicts in Africa often deprive displaced people of many things. Among them, according to the UNHCR official were property, work, role and status, family, neighbours, friends, nationhood and such other facilities as schools, hospitals and institutions of worship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the cost of Africa's conflicts is always a lot more than the immediate visible human suffering. In Mozambique's war, first against the Portuguese then later against the insurgent National Resistance Movement (RENAMO), the economy, health services, education, the infrastructure and even internal trade virtually collapsed enhancing a dependence syndrome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this southern African country, 45 per cent of the schools had by 1993 either been closed down or destroyed. The elephant population had dropped from 65,000 to 13,000 and by 1993 it was estimated that it would cost US dollars 600 million to rehabilitate the country's roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The raging civil war in southern Sudan on the other hand, has reportedly stalled oil mining, costing the Sudan an estimated annual earning of US dollars 136 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But as Africa suffers the repercussions from conflicts, the true beneficiaries of these macabre settings are said to be the suppliers of firearms. Africa's conflicts are said to be good fodder for firearm barons as the warring factions will out of necessity, increase expenditure on the purchasing of militaryware.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is ironical that the five permanent members of the security council (the United Kingdom , France, Germany, the United States and Italy), which have the ultimate responsibility for peace keeping worldwide, are reportedly the most prolific suppliers of firearms. In 1993, the Permanent Five as they are known, are said to have accounted for 95 per cent of all arms exports to the Third World.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the Sudan for instance, military expenditure rose five-fold in 10 years, from US dollars 34.5 million in 1982 to US dollars 1.01 billion in 1992. Worse still, these expenditures were incurred while drought and famine ravaged the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, Africa's conflicts are setting in motion absurd priorities where African leaders spend colossal amounts of money on guns while millions of their subjects starve. As a result of conflicts in Africa and the resulting absurdities and sufferings that go with them, a number of individuals and organizations are looking for home- grown solutions to stem off or reconcile these conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last October, International Alert, a London-based group concerned with global peace and human rights violations, convened a workshop at the Red Cross Centre, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where individuals and organisations interested in peace initiatives debated on &quot;Regional Mechanisms for Early Warning and Preventive Diplomacy in Africa&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Professor Hizkias Assefa, Director of the Nairobi Peace Initiative (NPI) a local non-governmental organisation working in the realm of peace seeking and reconciliation, said that the meeting discussed &quot;ways of nipping conflict in the bud.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the resultant report, the workshop recommends that &quot;conflicts can be a vehicle for social change that can be managed with the question posed as to whether conflict prevention might suppress legitimate social change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report further cautions; &quot;It is important in approaching conflict prevention in Africa, to take a critical perspective, consider the specific contexts, include as a factor the needs and demands of the marginalised, to be clear of objectives, consequences and interests, and to be aware of value judgements.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting also came up with various recommendations meant to address the problem of arms and ammunition and how to involve local people particularly women in the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still, some actors in the peace and reconciliation seeking groups think that to resolve the impasse of African conflicts, grassroots people have to be consulted and indeed be made active participants of the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;People at the grassroots level, must be made aware of their role as peace-makers. Education and information for these people is particularly important in early detecting and resolving conflict,&quot; says Mr. Greg Darr of People for Peace, a local peace lobby group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He adds that indigenous aspects of peacemaking must be incorporated in the process of peace seeking and reconciliation. Mr. Darr notes that local aspects to conflicts such as culture, economic differences, marginalization and inbuilt prejudices ought to be well understood when dealing with conflicts and how to resolve them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the other hand, there are those pursuing the attainment of civil peace in Africa who like the Catholic Church, believe that &quot;the root cause of violent conflicts is in people's hearts and unless that is dealt with, the situation in the world will not change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whatever opinions different institutions and individuals pursuing the issue on peace in Africa hold, it is becoming clear that more and more people are getting genuinely involved in efforts to attain civil peace. More than ever before, peacemakers are now seeking not only indigenous wisdom in combating conflict but also local participation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Due to endemic poverty, Africa is caught in a trap of underdevelopment. One reason for this is that the continent has inadequate telecommunication facilities. And because it is poor, its telecommunication infrastructure remains underdeveloped. But something is being done to help redress Africa's backward telecommunication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 35 years ago the late flamboyant Togolese leader, Sylvanus Olympio lamented that it was more difficult to make a telephone call to Accra in Ghana from Lome in neighbouring Togo than to call Paris or London more than 1,600 kilometres away in Europe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also lamented that to call most parts of Africa from within the continent, one had to be linked via London or Paris. Unless Africa could get away from this apron attachment to Europe, argued Olympio, the continent would remain destined to play a marginal role in world affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now things are likely to change, thanks to the ambitious Africa One project being implemented by the giant American telecommunications company, American Telephones and Telegraph Corporation (ATT).  The project proposes that by 1999, a hi-tech fibre optic cable would be in position under the sea off the African coastline which would link a total of 42 coastal cities in Africa from Cape Town, South Africa to Cairo, Egypt. This would vastly improve telecommunication possibilities on the African continent and boost its social-economic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Moses Osum, a Nigerian engineer who is in charge of Africa One project at the ATT-Bell Telephone Laboratories in the United States says the undersea (submarine) fibre optic cable will form a giant fibre optic loop around Africa measuring approximately 32,000 kilometers. Dr. Osum emphasised that while the Africa One loop would directly connect Africa's coastal countries, the countries in the interior would have automatic access to it either by satellite or land links. The Africa One loop would also be connected to fibre- optic cables linking America, Europe and Asia,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unlike ordinary telephone wires which depend on electrical signals to transmit information, a fibre optic cable uses light impulses to achieve the same. A fibre optic cable is a vast improvement over ordinary submarine cables which means tens of thousands of calls and other data can be transmitted simultaneously - telephone conversations, data, facsimile (or fax) video-phone, electronic mail etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Osum who also heads the Optical Transceiver Department at ATT- Bell Telephone Laboratories, says fibre optic cables would require minimal maintenance &quot;because there are very few parts that can go wrong.&quot; It would also be laid deep in the sea off the African coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last December in Nairobi, Kenya, Ms. Glenda Jones, a senior executive at ATT Africa One project, said once the scheme is off the ground, it will provide &quot;an efficient, cost effective backbone for advanced telecommunication within Africa itself, as well as access Africa to the vitally important Global Information Network - the Information Super Highway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this way Africa would be boosted not only in its ordinary telecommunication but in new dimensions and facilities like telemarketing (buying and selling via the computer) and video teleconferencing - bringing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> people together from all over the world in a conference using television screens and computers thus avoiding the hassles of long distance travel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The initial drawback is still the funding. The Africa One project will cost approximately US dollars 3 billion and will likely be hampered by cost over-runs. Ms. Jones said this problem was being sorted out. The World Bank, the African Development Bank and a consortium of private investors have already shown keen interest in the proposed venture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ATT which started the Africa One project in 1993 at the behest of the International Telecommunications Union, says once the funds hitch is sorted out, a fully operational cable would be in place by 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The availability of hi-tech telecommunication facilities would help attract new investments and promote Africa's international trade. The project will jump start Africa's woefully inadequate telecommunications and make the same easier for all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Osum, himself an inventor who originated a number of new electronic devices used by ATT which is one of the largest companies in the world today, is particularly keen to see Africans enter the Global Information network. He says education, health care and agriculture will be some of the areas that would be boosted tremendously by accessibility to the Network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People can be educated right in their villages. In health care, specialists can provide vital life saving information that can help in the treatment of a desperately ill patient deep in the African interior. Africa has a lot of resources but markets elsewhere in the world are ignorant about these resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa One will be run by a company to be incorporated in the Indian Ocean nation of Mauritius later this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Statistics show that most African countries have fewer than 0.25 lines (i.e less than one per cent) per 100 people. Uganda is one such country in Africa but the government has unveiled plans to increase telephone line availability to 2 lines per 100 person by the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Compared to advanced nations like Britain, Japan and the United States who have between 50-80 lines per 100 people, Uganda's projected line availability is still very much a Third World situation. However it will be a major boost to its economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate of 5.5 per cent during the past few years, Uganda has one of the fastest growing economies among developing countries. It has a per capita income of US dollars 286.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Currently, Uganda offers 42,000 subscriber lines. But within the next five years, demand is projected to reach 300,000 lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Mr. Kirunda Kivejinja, the Minister for Works, Transport and Communications, the Uganda Posts and Telecommunications (UPTC), will be restructured to allow the formation of a new private liability company to be called Uganda Telecommunications Limited (UTL). Private investors would be allowed to invest in the new venture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda would also allow a second national operator of telecommunications in order to ensure that UTL does not function as a monopoly, says Kivejinja in a policy document released recently.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cairo - Human rights group Amnesty International has condemned the slaying of six Christians and two Muslims by Islamic extremists in Egypt's southern province of Asyut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Islamic militants opened fire on a crowd of people in the Asyut village of Etmaniya, about 400 kilometres south of the Egyptian capital, on February 24, killing six Christians and two Muslims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An Amnesty statement said: &quot;The region where the killings took place is predominantly Coptic Christian and it appears that the killings were on account of religion.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Egyptian and Arab human rights groups have added their voice to condemnation of the sectarian violence, with the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights expressing its &quot;strong condemnation of the massacres organised by armed violent groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Copts are becoming the chief target for these groups. These innocent citizens are being murdered for purely religious reasons,&quot; the organisation said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least 24 people, including 11 Coptic Christians, have been killed in the Bedari region of Asyut, where Etmaniya is also situated, in the past few weeks in a spate of violent extremist attacks, which have also led to stepped-up police crackdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muslim militants fighting to overthrow the secular government in Cairo and replace it with an Iranian-style Islamic administration have killed nearly 1,000 since they began their violent campaign in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They have previously mostly targeted members of the security forces and foreign tourists, but the February 24 murder of six Christians could be an indication that the extremists may be starting to turn their guns against non-Muslims, especially Christians who do not support the installation of an Islamic fundamentalist government in Egypt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In another development, local authorities in the Nile Delta village of Kafr Dumyan, some 150 kilometres northeast of Cairo, called in the police on February 27 after violent clashes, pitting Muslims against Christians, broke out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to an official version on the situation there, violence was sparked by a rumour that a local priest planned to expand a church to create more room for the faithful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thousands of Muslim villagers then gathered and attempted to set the church on fire before police intervened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some villagers said Muslims looted their homes, but authorities described the Kafr Dumyan disturbances as a &quot;minor incident&quot; lasting just half-an-hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are an estimated six million Coptic Christians in Egypt, according to figures issued by the church. This northern African country has a population of some 54 million people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harare - Vesta Sithole, wife of veteran Zimbabwean politician, Rev.  Ndabaningi Sithole has vehemently denied accusations that she had betrayed him politically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports in Zimbabwean newspapers quoted Rev. Sithole alleging his wife was working with the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) of President Robert Mugabe to ensure the political downfall of ZANU-Ndonga party of Rev. Sithole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But talking to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) on February 27, Mrs. Sithole said she was concerned about her husband &quot;because he is not behaving like himself lately.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is painful when people create things that are not real,&quot; said Vesta Sithole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She explained that she lives together with her husband, cooks for him and makes his bed and was at a loss to understand the origin of her husband's accusations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Rev. Sithole, 76, has a history of health problems, a situation that was aggravated last October, following his arrest after a group of people made an abortive attempt in Harare on the life of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, 72, who has been in power since independence 16 years ago. Sithole denied any involvement and is out on bail in a case still pending in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Supporters of Rev. Sithole's ZANU-Ndonga party say the charges were trumped up to get their leader out of the way in the presidential elections due from March 16 to 17 in which Rev. Sithole is a challenger to President Mugabe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, observers expect Mugabe to sail through easily due to weak challengers and voter apathy. There is an estimated 4 million potential voters in Zimbabwe but election registers contain less than 2.5 million names, few of whom care to vote. In 1994, Sithole said that Zimbabweans have become apathetic to elections because Mugabe's ZANU-PF &quot;routinely rigs elections and intimidates voters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Analysts say the real issues close to the hearts of rural Zimbabweans is land redistribution which Mugabe promised to effect many times in the past but turned out to be fraught with problems. In Zimbabwe, most of the farmlands belong to about 100,000 white farmers.  The southern African country has a population of nearly 8.5 million people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - The Burundi peace initiative, due to have taken place in the Tunisian capital, Tunis on March 3, has been postponed to a later date yet to be announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former American President Jimmy Carter announced the postponement of the meeting on February 29, one week after fixing the date for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His Atlanta, US-based Carter Centre is involved in peace initiatives on the African continent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Tunis meeting was due to bring together leaders from the Great Lakes Region of eastern and central Africa - Zaire, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Tanzania in an attempt to defuse the volatile situation in Burundi and the humanitarian crisis posed by the estimated 1.7 million Rwandese refugees in camps in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rwanda. Both Zaire and Tanzania want the refugees to return home &quot;as soon as possible.&quot; Zaire is using its army to put pressure on them to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenya was not mentioned in the earlier dispatch from the Carter Centre.  It had been expected that Kenya would host the meeting President Daniel arap Moi announced soon after his return from a trip to Israel, mid-February that Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni had called him in Israel to let him know that the regional leaders had chosen Nairobi as the venue for the Burundi peace initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Tunis meeting would have been the second time in four months that the Carter Centre had organised a summit for leaders of the Great Lakes Region. The first meeting was held in the Egyptian capital Cairo, last November. It achieved little because there was a lot of polarisation among the participants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the next summit is held, it will re-assess promises made during the &quot;Cairo Declaration&quot; that generally remain unfulfilled. Besides defusing the crisis in Burundi, it will look into how to &quot;accelerate the large scale return of the Rwandese refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, African Foreign Ministers met here from February 22 to 29.  Informal consultations on the ethnic killings in Burundi made part of their deliberations. One of the guest facilitators at the meeting was former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Secretary General of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim emphasised that it was crucial for the people of Burundi to realise that dialogue holds the key to solving the inter- ethnic bloodshed in their country. Salim opposed plans for a proposed stand-by peacekeeping force put forward by United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi- The Church in Africa should avail more funds to train women in mass media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fact that the number of women admitted to church-run training institutes such as the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) Communication and Training Centre is not on the rise but dwindling, is in itself a strong enough arguement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Talking to APS on February 28, the Centre's Communication Consultant Mr.  Polycap Ochilo said the six-month Media Production Course this year admitted five women compared to seven in 1995. The course began on February 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This clearly speaks for itself. The number of women being admitted in the church-run communication centres such as the AACC is dwindling while that of men is on the rise,&quot; he pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the 21 participants for this year's media production course have been drawn from Uganda, Ethiopia, Ivory Coast, Angola, Sudan and host Kenya.  By the time of going to press, 18 students had already arrived but three were still expected from Tanzania, Ghana and Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The AACC Communication Consultant said students will be exposed to various modes of communication such as broadcasting techniques, script-writing, photography and news and feature writing for both electronic and print media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We also intend to run short courses between September and December, geared towards exposing participants to the role of the media in community participation and development,&quot; Mr. Ochilo further told APS.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moshi, Tanzania - Participants attending the Lutheran World Federation (LWF) Africa Workshop on Human Rights in this northern Tanzanian town from February 19 to 23, have underscored the need for churches in Africa to play a prophetic role and challenge any government or authority which violates human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The workshop, jointly organised by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania (ELCT) and the LWF Office for International Affairs and Human Rights, deliberated on issues under the theme, Equal Value- Equal Rights; The Challenge of Ethnic Diversity in Africa. It brought together some 40 participants mainly drawn from LWF member churches. Among Ecumenical organisations represented was the Nairobi-based All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Tanzania workshop was part of a series of regional workshops organised by the LWF in its endeavour to equip member churches to be more active in the field of awareness of universal human rights while having a clear understanding of how concern for human rights relates to Christian faith and ecclesiology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was convened with the aim to raise awareness of human rights, including civil and political rights as well as social and cultural rights, and the ways in which they relate to the consciousness and practices of local communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The forum also sought to increase knowledge about the local, regional and international mechanisms for the protection of human rights and to provide training in the use of these mechanisms in addressing actual human rights cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also included in the objectives of the workshop was the need to increase awareness of democratic structures and processes, with emphasis on people's participation in decision-making, including election procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The theme, Equal Value-Equal Rights; The Challenge of Ethnic Diversity in Africa, was meant to help participants move away from approaching the topic of human rights merely in a theoretical and removed experience. The subject aimed at inviting participants to be active in reflecting on human rights violations as an issue which is nearer home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting acknowledged that in recent years, many of the problems facing Africa have had to do with ethnic differences between peoples who have lived harmoniously together. The toll of human suffering in ethnic-related conflicts in Burundi, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan and Liberia, to mention a few cases, cannot be ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The five-day workshop was organised against the background that ethnic reality and identity are not necessarily evil but the misuse of ethnic identity is evil. The workshop worked towards identifying the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> fine distinction between the two ethnic features with the hope of helping participants identify human rights violations motivated by ethnicity and seek ways to address these contextual violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The workshop chose the theme on ethnicity because the number of conflicts and tensions based on the same has increased dramatically in Africa, and ethnic conflicts, to a much higher degree than conflicts between states, present a tragic record of human rights violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the end of the meeting, participants agreed that since many (ordinary) people are ignorant about their rights, it was crucial for churches to promote human rights awareness especially at grassroots level, and in so doing make the distinction between ethnic diversity and ethnicity and how the former can be used positively to build rather than destroy a society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also highlighted the need for churches to conduct seminars and training workshops for staff members so that every member can become an advocate for human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting also recommended that churches work towards the inclusion of human, civic, political, economic and environmental rights in the ordinary school curriculum as well as in theological training centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The participants also recommended that churches disseminate information on human rights through public and church media on various societal levels and also produce and distribute reading materials on human rights. This information should be translated into local languages, alternatively, education can be conducted through drama groups and audio-visual aids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Moshi meeting also underscored the need for churches to develop or strengthen specific ministries in hospitals, prisons and refugee camps among other vulnerable communities where they (churches) should also provide counselling on human rights, facilitate or organise small group discussions, eventually becoming a resource centre for human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the family level, churches were called upon to promote the rights of women and children in family, society and the church by conducting workshops, and seminars on women's and children's rights and carrying out research and case studies on the meaning of marriage and the role of the family in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Regarding ecumenical networking, the human rights workshop underlined the need for churches to form ecumenical networks and cooperate with other organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from working with other churches through national councils, the workshop also emphasised the need for Lutheran churches in Africa to develop a regional network in collaboration with and facilitated by the LWF. Similar networking through the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) human rights desk was also proposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Member churches of the LWF represented at the Moshi meeting included among others, the Lutheran Church of Christ in Nigeria, the Lutheran Church in Liberia, the Ethiopian Evangelical Lutheran Church Mekane Yesus, Moravian Church in Southern Africa and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Lutheran World Federation is a communion of Lutheran churches all over the world. Founded in Lund, Sweden, in 1947, the LWF currently has 122 member churches representing over 54 million of the world's 56 million Lutherans. In Africa LWF has 25 member churches with a total 7.5 million faithfuls..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The LWF acts on behalf of its member churches in areas of common interest such as human rights, theology, humanitarian assistance, communication, and the various aspects of mission and development work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In response to a basic Christian concern, the LWF monitors human rights abuses around the world closely and in consultation with its member churches, makes representation on behalf of individuals and groups whose rights and dignity are violated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The LWF peace fund has enabled progress to be made in encouraging peace efforts in such volatile areas as Central America and the Middle East. Member churches are assisted in establishing offices for human rights and peace efforts. In addition, pastoral delegations, staff visits and consultations contribute to a global ecumenical ministry for justice and peace.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Zimbabwe will be the venue for a week-long church-sponsored consultation on the African child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The March 10 to 17 event in the capital, Harare is being sponsored by the Association of Evangelicals in Africa (AEA) in partnership with the World Vision International, Compassion International and the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The consultation will deliberate on the theme, Generation at Risk: What Future. Some 100 participants drawn from children organisations and agencies in Africa are expected to attend.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The topics to be discussed will include the child in especially difficult circumstances with special emphasis on children of war, education, child growth and development. Other highlights include emphasis on accessibility of medical care and nutrition, social, cultural, economic and political effects on the African child, health and children's rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Against the background that problems affecting the African child will not disappear overnight but their effects can be mitigated to ensure that they do not target the children, the meeting hopes to share resources, data and information and urge leaders to prioritize the plight of the African child and put them on the list of agenda for &quot;First Call for Action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The consultation is also expected to provide a platform for continental networking for all groups with concern for children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The idea of holding the consultation was mooted in November 1994 during the Pan-African Christian Leaders Assembly (PACLA), held in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi and attended by some 800 Christian leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the PACLA assembly, the leaders underscored total commitment to the African child for the sake of the future of the continent. AEA was mandated to pursue the vision for the African child through its newly established children commission, the Evangelical Focus on Children (EFOC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African Child consultation is a follow-up of PACLA's ten-point plan of action that was spelt out after the conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commenting on the forthcoming meeting, a delegate to the consultation, the Rev. Dr. Setri Nyomi, of the AACC Christian and Family Life Education Department said: &quot;The idea to meet is very central. We look forward to its outcome&quot;, he said. On the AACC's commitment to issues pertaining to the African child, the Ghanaian church minister, who also coordinates the AACC's the Selfhood of the Church Unit said his department in close operation with the Women's Desk of the AACC, has already published a book, the Child Survival Study Guide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speakers at the Harare meeting will include Zimbabwe's Minister for Health and Child Welfare, Dr. T. Stamp; the AEA General Secretary Dr.  Tokunboh Adeyemo; Rev. Phylis Byrd, the AACC Associate General Secretary; Zimbabwean Member of Parliament, Dr. Inonge Lewanika; Dr. Nyomi, and Kenyan woman scholar, Dr. Edda Gachukia, among others.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - The media will be part of a new information unit formed by the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs to foster greater understanding and awareness of issues in the traumatized Great Lakes Region of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The unit officially known as the Integrated Regional Information Network (IRIN) also aims at stimulating an &quot;esprit de corps&quot; among the diverse disciplines such as military, political, humanitarian work, law and media which are responding to the complex emergency affecting the Great Lakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also contributes to better informed and more effective humanitarian action, including emergency preparedness of fostering greater awareness and understanding of regional issues.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ben Parker, Deputy Coordinator of IRIN observes that the &quot;Great Lakes Region at present, is a traumatized and terrorised part of the world whose tragedies, when not overlooked, are often misunderstood.&quot; As such IRIN will attempt to tackle the logistics of information flow through electronic mail where needed and appropriate and also through the use of traditional channels such as satellite, phones and high frequency radio telex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other parties to the network will include national authorities, non- governmental organisations (NGOs), United Nations agencies and donors, human rights organisations, political parties, regional Institutions, Academia and the Media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Great Lakes Region has recently experienced untold suffering particularly following the genocide in Rwanda in 1994 and the intermittent fighting in Burundi. Hundreds of refugees continue to flee to neighbouring countries such as Tanzania and Zaire, thus creating emergency situations in the surrounding region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Humanitarian relief and rehabilitation in the Great Lakes would benefit from better management of the information that is already available, and from access to well-presented regional analyses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Network will produce public domain reports of UN agencies and peace-keeping operations, NGOs, the Red Cross movement,and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and make them available in response to specific enquiries or by subscriptions to mailing lists.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - A Catholic bishop here has challenged Christian publishing houses in Africa to co-operate with each other in co-publishing in English and other widely spoken languages on the continent, to enable the rural (majority) people find an avenue through which issues close to them can be articulated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing Catholic publishers in Africa attending a seminar here from February 12 to 24, Rt. Rev. Bishop Peter Kairo of the Murang'a Catholic Diocese (in Kenya's Central Province region), called upon Christian publishers to think of how they could deploy some of their resources to train writers, editors, and printers among people in the rural areas as a way of not only imparting skills but also sowing seeds of a viable rural press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The seminar whose theme was Publishing at the Service of Evangelization, was organised by the Paulines Publications, Africa, (Daughters of St. Paul) in Nairobi. It brought together 28 Catholic publishers from 13 countries namely, Ethiopia, Zambia, Malawi, Benin, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Zaire, Congo, Namibia, Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishop Kairo reminded the Catholic publishers that not much has been done in realising the dream of ecumenical publishing and book distribution.  &quot;We are still operating within our closets as individual churches. It is disturbing that even our bookshops in most cases remain exclusive domains for Catholic books,&quot; he noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Murang'a Diocese Bishop recalled that the First Regional Meeting of Episcopal Commission for Social Communications in English Speaking West Africa held in Ghana, April-May 1973, recommended that apart from co-publishing in English and other widely spoken languages, national Christian publishing houses should also co-operate in giving translation rights of successful books.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like commercial publishers, Christian publishers mainly produce and distribute publications in cities while the majority of Christians (like the majority of Africa's population) are in rural areas, observed Bishop Kairo.  The Catholic bishop noted that this rural bias has some direct bearings on the form and content of the publications, as these tend to focus more on urban issues. &quot;While one realises that there are certain logistical problems of producing publications in rural areas, we have the challenge to change the imbalance that is now in favour of cities,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the pricing of publications, Bishop Kairo said that while books, magazines, newsletters and other publications have become very expensive because of high input costs, Christian publishers have an obligation to &quot;make very deliberate efforts to make those publications affordable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He singled out Paulines Publications for their efforts in making reading materials affordable. A case in point is their recent publication, Towards and African Narrative Theology. &quot;I am sure that if this publication had been done by a commercial publisher, the price would have been prohibitive,&quot; noted the Murang'a Diocese Bishop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 416-page volume, authored by Maryknoll Missionaries Father Joseph Healey and Donald Sybertz, is a summary of Africa's native wisdom in the form of proverbs, myths, riddles, sayings, plays and songs. It sells at Kenya shillings 200 (about US dollars 4).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paying tribute to those publishers who have realised the need to empower Christians by publishing in local languages, Bishop Kairo said although the need to publish in local languages is sometimes a controversial issue, there is no way any Christian publisher can ignore the fact that African languages are the key to grassroots communications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Publishing in local languages does not just make the material more accessible to those who are not highly literate but also enobles languages that have been denigrated even though theircommunication is overwhelming,&quot; Bishop Kairo noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Participants, whose theme reflected on the Pastoral Exhortation, &quot;The Church in Africa&quot;, shared policies, achievements, problems and future plans of their respective publishing houses. With the help of experts, they acknowledged the need to clarify their policies by improving professionalism in publishing, book production and marketing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Catholic publishers resolved to help in the evangelization of Africa by publishing materials which answer people's spiritual, moral, cultural, educational and socio-economic needs and committed themselves to promote justice and peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The seminar also highlighted the need to encourage local literature and oral culture, saying these could only be achieved if publishers do not isolate themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Participants agreed on the need to form an association, the Association of the Catholic Publishers in Africa (ACPA) which aims at fostering communications and practical cooperation among publishers and with the Church.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ladies and gentlemen,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is a great honour to be in Bamako as your guest, I thank you</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sincerely for the very warm welcome you have extended to me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is a privilege to be among the members of the business community of Mali. It symbolises the new era in which we now live:one of co-operation between two great Africa nations. Above all I welcome the opportunity to share ideas with you on how we can expand economic links between our countries in order to benefit our peoples.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are able to discuss these matters because our South Africa has freed itself from apartheid, with the support of the people of Mali. We can now together, and in co-operation with the rest of Africa, face the challenges of Africa's renewal through development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The entrepreneurs and traders of Africa should be in the forefront of our continent's regeneration, for the well-being of our continent is directly linked to its economic development. For this reason the South African Government is committed to working for the rapid promotion of economic ties with its fellow African States. It seeks to do so within a framework which both rewards enterprise and promotes balanced economic development. South Africa sees its destiny as inextricably linked to that of the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A significant dividend resulting from South Africa's transition to democracy has been the normalisation of our relations with the countries of Africa. In the case of mali this has already meant the establishment of full diplomatic relations, a doubling of bilateral trade and the initiation of major South African investment projectsin Mali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We hope that the business people of Mali will take advantage of the accessibility of the South African Trade Counsellor in Abidjan who frequently visits Bamako, to identify further opportunities for trade with South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are also confident that the conclusion of an Agreement for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of investment between Mali and South Africa will strengthen confidence in our economic links We take pride in the fact that South Africa's presence in Mali also symbolised by gold. The Anglo-American Corporation's extensive involvement in the development of the Sadiola Hill Gold Mine will bring benefits to the peoples of both Mali and South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We encourage South African enterprise to participate in construction and development projects in other African countries, where this is done in such a way that it s also assists those countries efforts to achieve sustained development. For South Africa the Sadiola project creates trade and employment opportunities. For Mali it should bring not only jobs and exports, but also a transfer of South African mining technology and skills which will permanently increase the capacity of Malians to contribute to the wealth of the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is a particularly opportune moment for Mali's businessmen and entrepreneurs to engage their counterparts in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The policies adopted by our government in order to create a climate for growth are beginning to bear fruit. The South African economy is healthier than it has been in many decades. The rekindling of business confidence and optimism reflect the solid foundation on which the economic upswing is based.  Expansion of the manufacturing sector, substantial growth in fixed investments and large inflows of capital promise a durable recovery. They hold out the possibility of an even better performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Welcome as this development is, we are determined to achieve still higher levels of growth. For, we need to so if we are to make a significant impact on employment and produce more resources to uplift the living conditions of our people. To this end government has been galvanised with the challenge of formulating medium term strategy for sustained development and growth to lift us beyond our present constraints, some of which we share with most of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amongst other things such a strategy would include expanded trade and investment relations with African countries and a resolute pursuit of regional co-operation and development integration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would include measures to promote investment in particular sector and areas. Investment that entrance foreign exchange earnings, build infrastructure and make our people more productive would have high priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To achieve these objectives on a regional and continental scale will call for a concerned pursuit of unity and co-operation. That will also give our regions and our continent a more powerful voice in the world markets than any nation would have on its own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The challenges facing our countries in transition and the whole of Africa is magnified by the fact that we live in a time when the advanced industrial countries are consolidating themselves into powerful economic and political blocs to strengthen their bargaining positions in world markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa is particularly sensitive to this at the moment as we seek to establish a new framework of agreement within which our trade relations with the European Union could be conducted on an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> equitable and mutually advantageous basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa is also working with its Southern African partners to engage the industrial world in development of the region, and further afield on the continent. The increased levels of foreign interest in Southern Africa as a destination for investment reflect the passive potential or our region for sustained economic growth and development. Democratic systems of governance, a commitment to the peaceful resolution of conflict, disciplined use of public resources together with ambitious programmes of reconstruction are the key ingredients which are attracting this interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ladies and gentlemen;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African business, now freed from the narrow confines created by apartheid, are eagerly looking to Africa, including Mali, for opportunities for trade and investment. There is every reason why you, the economic actors of mali,l should visit South Africa and see for yourselves the many opportunities for doing business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would also be an opportunity to experience South African hospitality, which we enjoy extending to fellow Africans who come to see our own beautiful country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May our partnership prosper to the benefit of our countries and the people of Africa!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I thank you.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bamako - Address By President Nelson Mandela To The National Assembly Of Mali, March 2, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Your Excellency Mr President;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Honourable President of the National Assembly;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Honourable Members of the National Assembly;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ladies and Gentlemen,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is a great honour to be here in Mali today and I would like to thank the Government and people of Mali for the very warm welcome they have extended to me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation at being the guest of the National Assembly of Mali. I am moved at having this opportunity to address the elected representatives of a people which, like the people of South Africa, has known the pain of being denied freedom and what it is to fight for democracy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since 1992 Mali and its National Assembly have stood out as examples on a continent striving for democracy. Mali also has a distinguished record as a champion of regional and African unity.<BR> On behalf of all South Africans, I would like to thank the Government and people of Mali for their support and their contribution over the years to the struggle against apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although this is our first official visit to Mali, we know that we are amongst long-standing friends; brothers and sisters who shared in our victory as they shared in our struggle. And it is my pleasant task to report to you that the people of South Africa are resolutely taking advantage of their freedom to address their basic needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Your Excellency, Honourable Members of the Assembly;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amongst the fruits of our liberation is the opportunity at last to develop normal relations between South Africa and the other countries of Africa, including Mali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the short space of time since we achieved democracy, full diplomatic relations have been established between South Africa and Mali and trade between our two countries has already doubled. This is only the start and we look forward to the strengthening of all-round relations, promoted amongst other things by our present visit to Mali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ladies and gentlemen;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We also look forward to strengthened relations so that we can work together to address the challenges which confront Africa. Our continent's future prosperity depends on co-operation and unity between nations. In the same way that South Africa's reconstruction and development will succeed only through a partnership of all its social structures, so too is the destiny of each nation inextricably linked to that of the African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Economically, the South African Government therefore seeks a rapid promotion of economic ties between South Africa and its fellow African States. Our own socio-economic development is dependent on balanced economic development, both within our Southern African region and on the continent as a whole. Only then can we fulfill our urgent responsibility of addressing the fearful poverty that blights the lives of millions of Africa's children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The economic renewal of Africa, however, requires peace, stability and the nurturing of democratic systems of governance. Our regional and continental organisations, SADC and ECOWAS, and the Organisation of African Unity, provide frameworks through which solidarity between Africa's nations can promote these goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's own history has taught it what the world knows, that injustice and oppression are enemies of peace and development. We are therefore strongly committed to working together with other countries, in equal partnership, for the peaceful resolution of conflicts and for the promotion of democracy and human rights everywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is in this context that I would like to say a few words about Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The situation in Nigeria has deeply saddened us all. I believe that it was in this spirit that the delegation of Mali, together with that of South Africa, supported the Resolution on Nigeria in the General Assembly's Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee in December last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I hope the Government of Nigeria will reconsider its position and receive the Special Ministerial Mission appointed by the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group. I do so in particular because the objective of the Special Mission is to pursue a dialogue with the Nigerian Government so that it may assist with that country's early return to civilian democratic rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ladies and gentlemen; if we celebrate the strides taken in the last few years towards democratisation and civil peace in Africa, it is not to ignore the tragedies that have also occurred, such as those in Rwanda, Burundi, and Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We hope that the problems in Sierra Leone, Niger and Guinea which blight the collective image of Africa and set the continent back in her renaissance will be resolved in the best interests of Africa's people and the cause of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa will continue to be closely involved in OAU efforts to reduce tension, prevent conflict and solve existing conflict situations on the continent. We believe that the OAU Central Organ for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution, to which South Africa was elected in 1994, has a vital role to play in creating a stable and secure Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was for that reason that the South African Government has this past month made a further contribution to the OAU Peace Fund of approximately R1,2 million. We are further committed to vigorously supporting initiatives aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the OAU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa has also been closely involved, within the limits of its capacities, in OAU Ministerial visits to Burundi; in assisting the achievement of peace and stability in Angola by contributing the costs of quartering UNITA soldiers; and in technical assistance towards the training of demobilised soldiers in Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alongside the all important role which the OAU is expected to play in conflict prevention and resolution, South Africa believes that the continent's regional organisations should also have the instruments needed for them to play a meaningful role in this regard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These sentiments were part of the founding vision of our own regional organisation, the Southern African Development Community, and during the past year we were able to witness the effectiveness of regional co-operation in resolving a potentially serious conflict situation in Lesotho.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I would like to take this opportunity of expressing my admiration, and personal support, for the strenuous and tireless efforts of the West African States, through ECOWAS and ECOMOG, to bring peace to Liberia. These endeavours are an example to all of us in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ladies and gentlemen;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the final analysis we are talking about the resolution of these problems not as an end in itself, but because we believe that development cannot take place without democracy or prosperity without peace. The time has come for Africa to come into her own, to take her destiny into her own hands in order to better the lives of her people rather than suffer perpetual marginalisation and continue as supplicants with begging bowl in hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With this in mind I would like to wish the people of Mali and you, their elected representatives, encouragement and success as you proceed along the path of democracy upon which, like us, you have only recently embarked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank you.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Profund Warriors chairman Donald Mulenga has joined the race for the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) top seat after being nominated by City of Lusaka football club for the chairmanship in the elections slated for April 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The nomination of Mulenga brings to three the number of candidates that have lined up for the top Anchor House job. The others are former national coach Brightwell Banda and recently a politican, Jazzman Chikwakwa a member of parliament from the ruling MMD who declared he was standing despite regulations from both FIFA and CAF that politicians should keep off sport.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> City of Lusaka chairman, Simataa Simataa, who announced the candidature of Mulenga, further named his vice at City, Simon Phiri as another candidate his club had nominated for the FAZ polls,with Lusaka City Council official, Leonard Ngoma as the third nominee from Woodlands Stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have nominated the three officials because they approached us for our support and after sitting as an executive we feel they are the right people for FAZ,&quot; said chairman Simataa Simataa in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked what made his executive agree to the nomination of the three, Simataa based his reply on their involvement in soccer for some time as the main reason but hinted that City was willing to support others if they approached them before the deadline for nominations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They are all men of massive experience in soccer and that's why we agreed to support them. And if there are others that want our support, we will have to look at them and see if we can support them, we are open but anyone who wants our support must do that before the Thursady 14 March deadline,&quot; said Simataa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mulenga, who has been at the helm of cashless Profund Warriors for almost six years is seen as the suitable candidate because of his maturity in handling issues, while Phiri and Ngoma will be banking on their abilities to transform their respective clubs to high heights in the last season.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Lusaka High court Judge Kabazo Chanda yesterday granted leave to Post managing director and editor-in-chief Fred M'membe and managing editor Bright Mwape, to issue a writ of Habeas Corpus asking the State to give reasons for their indefinite detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The case will be heard on Tuesday March 12, a Youth day public holiday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Post newspapers lawyer Sakwiba Sikota of Central Chambers explained that it was not odd for the Courts to hear urgent applications on public holidays.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Injunctions are urgent applications which allow you to even follow a judge to his house at midnight. Writs of Habeas Corpus are even more urgent in that you can interrupt any Court proceedings if you have any such application. I trust that this is the reason why the Court has set the hearing for Tuesday,&quot; Sikota said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And in an affidavit in support of the application, M'membe has stated that neither he nor Mwape has &quot;been accorded an opportunity of a fair trial in any court of law with an independent panel to adjudge as is required under our constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have not been accorded any of the due processes of the law as set out in the rules of natural justice and in our constitution as my accusers are the same people who have purported to give me an indefinite sentence of imprisonment,&quot; M'membe, who is being held at Lusaka Central Prisons says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> M'membe also says that he has sworn the affidavit of behalf of Mwape who the authorities have taken to Kabwe and &quot;cannot be reached to swear his own affidavit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In another development The Post has petitioned the Supreme Court to determine the constitutionality of the speaker's and parliament's action in assuming a judicial role. Hearing for this case which poses questions on separation of powers between parliament and the judiciary has been set for May 7, this year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Police on March 5 invaded a Makeni farm house in search of clues of where the detained Post editors stayed before they reported to Parliament on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The heavily armed police invaded former Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC) director, Steven Moyo's farm to search for &quot;seditious documents&quot; stolen from an &quot;unknown&quot; place and cordoned off the farm allowing people to go in but not to get out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And both police spokesman, Francis Musonda and Lusaka Division commading officer, Wynter Kabwiku yesterday claimed they were not aware of the search at Moyo's farm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am not aware of that. I really don't know anything about the search,&quot; Musonda said, adding, &quot;I will however, find out from relevant officers about it and I will come back to you.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But both Moyo and his wife Orlean confirmed that their farm was surrounded by heavily armed police from 14:00 hours to 19:30 hours when they left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;From 14:30 hours the police did not allow anyone to go out from the farm. My place was virtually a prison and my wife was very upset about,&quot; Moyo said, adding: &quot;My mother, who is staying with us cried throughout the search.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The family believes the police search was political harassment and they recalled that March 5 was exactly three years since Steven was detained in 1993 over the Zero Option Plan allegation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Why should they bother my son? All this makes me cry, especially when I recall the times I spent in Southern Province in 1993 when he was detained,&quot; Moyo's mother said yesterday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Moyo, who doubted the reasons given on the search warrant said from the manner they conducted their search later that evening there was no doubt they were not looking for any documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We will have to stop this harassment because the manner they did this was suspect. They tell you one thing and do something else. They were obviously looking for someone,&quot; Moyo said, adding: &quot;Why should the police interview my workers if they were looking for seditious documents? They called our workers one by one and were asking them whether there had been visitors staying at the farm in the past one month.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His lawyer, Ian Zulu of Chongwe and Company confirmed that though the farm was occupied at 14:00 hrs the search when it actually started after 19:00 hrs took only about ten minutes. He also said there was no intimidation from police except that their presence had so much psychological effects on the family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But they did not find any of the documents they were looking for and this search came exactly three years since police came to search for the Zero Option documents from my client's residence on March 5 1993,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In two separate interviews, Musonda pleaded ignorance of the search despite being told that the search warrant and the officer executing it were from force headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I do not know anything, if that warrant was from headquaters, find out from them,&quot;he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Moyo, who is secretary to the Makeni Neighbourhood Watch but failed to attend its meeting on Tuesday because of the search, was not assured by Musonda's denials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have been hurt as a family. We need to be assured that our security is guaranteed. If police can move into one's home any time on flimsy grounds how secure are we?&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former ZNBC director general is supported by the search warrant which originated from force headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the warrant a detective chief inspector Zimba of force headquarters with seven other heavily armed officers, was detailed to invade the farm and search for &quot;seditious documents&quot; from a farm house belonging to &quot;Stephen Moyo&quot; of Makeni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You are hereby authorised and commanded in the name of the President with proper assistance, to enter the farm house of Stephen Moyo aforesaid, any time and there diligently search for the said goods, and if the same or any thereof are found on search, to bring the goods so found, and also the said Stephen Moyo before this court to be dealt with according to law,&quot; reads in part the warrant, signed by magistrate Silavwe, and originally indicating daylight as time for the search.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Zimba later went back to police headquaters to have the warrant changed to read that the search be conducted at any time.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mwanakatwe draft constitution states that: &quot;There shall be a speaker of the National Assembly who shall be elected by the members of parliament from among the members and that he shall vacate the seat as an elected member.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sam Mulafulafu from the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace proposed that eminent names of people be selected from outside parliament by a special committee of MPs which should be represented fairly.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It will be difficult to have a speaker from outside parliament because under the current law, it is only MPs either elected by the people or nominated by the President who can speak in parliament and the President when opening it.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The debate on the status of the speaker was deferred to today with all citizens demanding to have a non partisan speaker.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They said appointees should be from the ministries of legal affairs, home affairs and health.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also said the President should not have absolute discretion in the appointments of the advisory committee to make sure there is no abuse of office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A committee to look at the clause which gives the President these powers in the Mwanakatwe draft consitution was formed to make amendments which will later be included in the &quot;Green paper&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The amendment of Article 96 (1) now reads in part: &quot;There shall be an advisory committee on the prerogative of mercy which shall consist three permanent members from the, Ministry of Legal Affairs, Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Health. There shall be three other members.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Zambia today is at political crossroads. Where is the country going? Are the hopes generated by the political changes of 1991 still in existence? Have they blossomed from their nascence of 1991?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The MMD came to power on the back of democracy. The party's name - Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) bears testimony to the hope and belief made in July 1990.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But has democracy continued to grow since the euphoric songs of 1990 and 1991 or has it died an untimely death?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is no doubt that the Zambia of today is different from the Zambia of 1991. People appear more disillusioned, more defeated than they were five years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, people appear to have accepted their lot, that they had wanted change and that change God gave them and now they must pay for their folly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps this is why they seem to be silent when the worst atrocities are committed against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, despite this acceptance of their lot, there are growing concerns among several enlightened Zambians about the direction of democracy today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition parties and non governmental organisations (NGOs) have been in the forefront in expressing these concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since last Friday, the Civil Society, an umbrella organisation embracing all pressure groups, has been meeting to discuss the constitution of Zambia.  They were forced to meet because the MMD government has refused to have a meaningful discussion of the subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Civil Society and opposition parties have tried to make the government see the sense of meeting, discussing and reaching a consensus without positive results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the Mwanakatwe Constitutional Review Report which recommended a constituent assembly and a referendum as the most desirable mode of adopting the constitution the government rejected this in its white paper. It has since published a constitutional bill which, within the next 30 days will be passed. The government has done this despite the protests of the majority of Zambians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another area of concern raised by pressure groups is the registration of voters and the conduct of the forthcoming elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Again, the government has been adamant and has maintained its decision that the registration of voters will be done by Nikuv Computers, a company whose performance in Zimbabwe is discredited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Everyone is expressing concern about government performance on many fundamental issues except the government itself. Apart from elections, concerns have been raised about the re-established Public Order Act which has given the police wider powers to control freedom of assembly than at any time in the history of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This week apart from Civil Society, the American ambassador to Zambia Roland Kuchel has joined the many voices expressing concern about government conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing students on prospects of the forthcoming elections in Zambia at the University of Zambia, Kuchel did not hide his concern in diplomatic nicesities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The US government would like to know whether or not the Zambian government will continue to maintain political stability, that the interest of the private sector will be safeguarded and that the rule of law will be advanced,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Further, Kuchel said his government was looking forward to seeing that the coming elections will be free and fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He emphasised: &quot;We would like to know whether the elections will be held in a free and fair environment. People will measure the level of democracy in Zambia on how the 1996 elections will be conducted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These concerns from Kuchel and the American government are not new.  Other donor countries have expressed them in several meetings between the Zambian government and the donor community here in Zambia and abroad in Paris or Bournemouth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But they appear to have fallen on deaf ears. While the Zambian government seems to agree and assure the donors that they will abide by good governance, their actions are far from their commitments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It appears each passing day has seen a worsening of government's behaviour towards pressure groups and opposition parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There has grown in Zambia today a steady criminalisation of dissent by the ruling party and especially by the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is not too late, we hope, for our government to realise the folly of its path of intransigence and accept that consesus will achieve stability and development in our country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - An upbeat De Beers -- which this week announced a 14% increase in its attributable earnings to R2,25-billion for 1995 -- is confident that 1996 will see its control of the rough diamond market strengthen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That control was threatened when Russia began leaking stones into the market in 1993, in violation of its five-year contract with De Beers' Central Selling Organisation. It then side-stepped attempts to renew the agreement, which expired in December.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally a memorandum was signed last month between the government of the Russian Federation and De Beers to defuse the crisis. It covers the principles of a new three-year trade agreement, which could be signed by the end of this month, said deputy chairman Nicky Oppenheimer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It reconfirms De Beers as the sole buyer of diamonds destined for export from Russia (about 50% of run-of-mine goods). As allowed in the previous contract, Russia can sell a 5% cut of every shipment as a price-checking mechanism; for the lower quality stones, this will be increased to 20%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is very different to our standard contract with Botswana, Namibia and Australia, where there has always been a firm relationship between the price we buy at from the producers and the price we sell at to the market,&quot; says Oppenheimer, adding that this was never the case with Russia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The memorandum also clears up misunderstandings surrounding part- processed goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Russia had been privately selling what it termed part-processed stones (sometimes with a single facet), which De Beers termed rough. But, said Oppenheimer: &quot;These goods now form part of our exclusivity agreement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another area of dispute that the new agreement will resolve is the definition of technical diamonds.  &quot;Many of these technical diamonds have become polishable in India and we have agreed to redefine what are technical diamonds today rather than what they were yesterday,&quot; said Oppenheimer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although half of Russia's run-of-mine goods will be kept by Russia for its cutting and polishing industry, De Beers is entitled to buy whatever is unable to be polished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of the stones supplied to De Beers from Russia's stockpile -- believed to be mainly lower-quality diamonds - -- an average price will be agreed upon in advance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the Russian threat behind it, De Beers can focus full attention on Australian producer Argyle whose contract expires in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Argyle -- mainly a supplier of small, low-quality stones -- has also blustered about going it alone, but sources report it doesn't have the power Russia had to derail the De Beers cartel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;With all the uncertainty of last year, the lower end of the market lost value rapidly but with the new Russian deal, it should stabilise and it's in Australia's best interests to sign up again with De Beers,&quot; says a diamond analyst.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Two years after South Africa's first democratic elections there is a sense of economic inertia. Part of the transition problem has been building a new government on old structures; conservatism is deeply entrenched, in business as well as government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Policy-makers are loath to upset the apple-cart of international opinion with controversial -- but necessary -- proposals for job creation and economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So says Dr Robert Zevin, an American economist with a long and abiding interest in this country in his capacity as director of the Fund for Democratic Elections in South Africa and The New World Foundation. He believes a radical re-think is needed before the impasse leads to stagnation and political instability.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South Africa Foundation last week noted that with gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 4%, an annual rate of job creation of 0,5% in the formal sector, and 2 to 3% increase in the labour force, no dent in the unemployment rate was likely in the short to medium term. The foundation looked to the Far East for inspiration, favouring a low-wage, labour-intensive route to expansion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zevin, however, believes such a framework to be totally inappropriate to South Africa -- a middle-income, medium-technology economy. What this country needs is a typical Keynesian kick-start; present fiscal policies are consistent with a high employment economy, not one with a 40 to 50% unemployment rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government should spend R250-billion over the next eight years on the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP), satisfying the demand for job creation and service provision in one go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Says Zevin: &quot;Drastic problems call for drastic solutions. The private sector alone cannot create the millions of jobs needed by the year 2000, nor will it build all the houses and provide all the services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;No matter how much legislation is implemented to make mortgage provision easier, for instance, companies will continue to invest in office blocks in Sandton; there is no money in squatter camps and private capital is return- driven.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His premise is that once the accelerator effect has kicked in, with 60% of that extra RDP expenditure going on low-income labour, GDP will grow by a factor of R1,89, that is, every R1 spent will boost GDP by R1,89. This in turn will raise capital spending by businesses from 16% of GDP to over 25%.  Growth will be higher and tax revenues will rise by more than the additional expenditure, bringing the deficit down sharply as a percentage of GDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mere mention of adding to the budget deficit gives most economists sleepless nights. Any deviation from strict fiscal discipline would result in international opprobrium, capital flight and a collapse in confidence, they say. But present policies have done much to encourage short-term portfolio investment and less foreign direct investment, which creates jobs and growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's situation is unique; there is no precedent for successfully overcoming a massive unemployment rate in a low-growth, middle-income economy. There are plenty of examples of burgeoning budget deficits and their disastrous effects, notably in Latin America, and these scenarios are invariably quoted to silence the Keynesians. But laissez-faire economics has not had a good run in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa should shrug off international opinion, says Zevin. Even local investors will buy government bonds if the returns are high enough; there is no need to seek approval or credit from the World Bank. Indeed, South Africa is perfectly positioned to implement its own &quot;Marshall plan&quot; in the region, extending credit to neighbouring countries, which in turn will buy our goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The unemployment problem cannot be ignored; the government must harness untapped resources of labour, raw materials and industrial capacity to set the economy on a 7 to 10% growth path. Trying to galvanise the private sector in this direction is tantamount to ants pushing an elephant, says Zevin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The alternative, he believes, is to sacrifice all the gains of social transformation to economic failure. Instead of trying to cut the budget deficit to levels lower than most western countries achieve, South Africa must seek its own solution, capitalising on export competitiveness and economic autonomy on the African continent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The most recent estimates from South African Agriculture Union economist Koos du Toit are that the good rains should see a 20% rise in the gross value of farm output this year to R35- billion (R28,9-billion was realised in 1995). On the farms, this should translate into R12,5-billion in gross profits (R9,7-billion).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Du Toit reckons the rains are directly worth as much as an extra percentage point to South Africa's economic growth rate this year compared to an average agricultural season. With most economists forecasting gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 3% to 4% this year, the rains could thus account for a quarter of this year's economic growth.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Standard Bank's Rudi Wilsenach, senior general manager of agriculture, is more sanguine. He is looking at agriculture adding an extra 0,25 to 0,5 percentage points to GDP growth this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What is not disputed is that just about every area in South Africa has enjoyed good rains and regional economies will benefit hugely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With total capital assets of nearly R70-billion, contributing 4% to 6% to South Africa's GDP and employing 16,5% of the economically active population, the economic importance of agriculture is immense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main beneficiary is the maize industry where crops of over nine million tons, even 10-million tons, appear likely. This will be double last year's miserable crop and means some 2,5-million tons of maize could be exported into an international market where dollar prices of maize are 22% up on a year ago, and the rand has dropped. Du Toit guesses that maize exports could bring in R1,2- billion this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The wheat crop is estimated at 2,3- million tons (1,8-million last year) which should cover domestic consumption. Sugar is expected to yield 2,2-million tons this year (1,8- million), while horticulture output is anticipated to grow 10% to 12% and animal production should remain constant as herds are rebuilt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unifruco, the export marketing arm of the deciduous fruit industry, is looking at exporting 50-million cartons this season, the same as last season which brought in R2-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Standard Bank calculates that total agricultural exports have risen from 4,7% of South Africa's total exports in 1983 to 7% in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1994, when South Africa enjoyed a bumper agricultural season, agricultural exports totalled R8,3- billion and imports R4,9-billion. Du Toit is looking at around R8,5-billion to R9-billion in exports this year and R5,5-billion to R6-billion in imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trend is clear -- in a deregulating agricultural industry imports are increasing more rapidly than exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1995 farm debt rose 7,5% to R19,6- billion or 26% of farm assets. Du Toit reckons this ratio could fall to 24% this year, but notes this is still too high. &quot;A comfortable level is 20%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commercial banks are the largest financiers of this debt. Standard Bank estimates banks have a 34% share, the Land Bank 23% and agricultural co- operatives 20%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As for food prices, the producer prices of field crops rose 28% in 1995, horticulture products 9,5% and livestock only 3,6% (thanks to competition from importers). These producer price hikes are not neatly correlated with retail price movements in 1995. For consumers grain prices rose 6,4% in 1995, meat 10% and fruit 17,3%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over this year Du Toit is looking at food prices rising an average 6% to 10%, in line with the consumer price index. But producer prices will fluctuate -- falling 6% to 10% for field crops and rising 8% for horticulture products and 5% for livestock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So the rains will bring more food, although not cheaper, and contribute favourably on a net basis to the GDP and balance of payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Looking beyond the numbers, the rains will make the traumatic reforms in the agricultural sector easier. The industry is moving towards market- determined pricing, greater exposure to imports and thus international competition, land reform and less regulation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Natalie Gamsu, back in South Africa after a four-year stint in New York, returns to a closing venue: the Cape Town landmark Upstairs at Elaine's will go dark after Gamsu's show closes. Punters should break their necks, however, to see the swansong.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gamsu is better than ever, the beneficiary of some tough lessons playing New York spots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Big Apple evidently appreciated the powerhouse -- the New York Backstage Bistro Award for outstanding vocalist went her way in 1994, as did a most outstanding debut artist nomination from the Manhattan Association of Cabaret last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the mother city, it's not hard to see why. Curtain up and the songstress appears striking in a black velvet gown, with only a mike as prop.  Sting's Sister Moon finds its carefully enunciated way into the audience and it's obvious that good has got better -- New York has disciplined Gamsu and focused the rush of energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her choice of material goes way beyond the usual dreary standards. Tori Amos's Silent All These Years gets new meaning, ditto Marianne Faithfull's Guilt, and Gamsu's Craig Carnelia rendition of Flight calls for the hatches to be firmly battened down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Gamsu's forte is comedy, and the whacky numbers are the strongest.  Wouldn't You Rather Love a Great Big Woman? gets a firm &quot;oh yeah!&quot;, setting the pace for the highlight, a monologue of Gloria Gaynor's I Will Survive.  Gamsu mixes song, acting and chutzpah to lift the roof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not much can top that, and the show dips markedly towards its conclusion. But her African trilogy (Miriam Makeba's Ntyilo, Ntyilo, Edi Niederlander's Ancient Dust of Africa and Jennifer Ferguson's Roses) has the potential to invoke tears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gamsu performs Upstairs at Elaine's in Observatory until March 17</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harare - Did you jump or were you pushed? The question from colleagues was understandable, given the mounting list of casualties in the Modus House massacre -- last month's ruthless purge of staffers at Zimbabwe's pre-eminent independent newspaper, The Financial Gazette, flagship of troubled Modus Publications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I had the satisfaction at least of handing in my resignation. That same day a memo had arrived from management banishing reference to &quot;personalities&quot; in the news, an unambiguous reference to President Robert Mugabe who is entering the final week of an election campaign. The same memo sought to limit unkind references to Zimbabwe's leadership by reminding staffers of the need to produce a newspaper that was &quot;truly Zimbabwean in context and character&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This Orwellian injunction was part of an attempt by Modus chief executive Elias Rusike to &quot;restructure&quot; The Financial Gazette to make it more palatable to Zimbabwe's rulers after unprecedented attacks on the newspaper in the state and ruling-party media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was the newspaper's satirical comments which raised high-level hackles. When Mugabe referred last year to the human rights body, ZimRights, as an organisation of &quot;ZimLooters&quot;, The Financial Gazette's Muckraker column replied that such charges were inappropriate emanating from the chairman of Robbers and Muggers (RobMug) Ltd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zanu PF's organ, The Peoples Voice, charged the intention of Financial Gazette writers was to &quot;play havoc with the minds of the majority ... This psychological warfare has as its objective the brainwashing of Zimbabwe's media practitioners so that they adopt anti- national and thus anti-Zimbabwe attitudes&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What the party and government really objected to, of course, was The Financial Gazette's exposure of high- level corruption, its advocacy of constitutional reform, and its insistence upon fiscal rectitude. In a society where ministers are largely unaccountable, where presidential posturing is reported as divine revelation, and the fiscus is regularly plundered by the ruling party to sustain its administrative functions, The Financial Gazette's approach was indeed subversive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Modus proprietors obediently responded to official complaints by suspending their editor and muzzling journalists. Instead of standing by the editor they silenced him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Financial Gazette will now be unable to reveal anomalies in the land redistribution process that have favoured an official elite; nor will it be able to raise questions about government's spending priorities which have led to the collapse of hospital services and the closure of training institutes while Mugabe and his cabinet award themselves salary increases of up to 134%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In my four years as assistant to editor Trevor Ncube and as a columnist committed to disclosing the connection between flawed governance and national impoverishment, I was privileged to serve a newspaper with the courage of its convictions -- situated at the cutting edge of Zimbabwe's democratisation process. That process has suffered a serious blow with the effective silencing of The Financial Gazette's voice and Ncube's departure. By their actions, its timid proprietors have ensured -- wittingly or unwittingly -- that the country's well-entrenched ruling elite no longer has to answer for its conduct, a situation perilous to good governance and inimical to the interests of all Zimbabweans.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg -Top-secret government documents handed to court in the Magnus Malan murder trial make repeated use of an English and Afrikaans word &quot;marionette&quot; when describing covert military negotiations with Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conspiracy at the centre of the trial, Project Marion, deriving from marionette and its synonyms -- dummy, puppet, manikin and pawn -- describe how the State Security Council in 1985 viewed Buthelezi as a central component of its strategy to recruit surrogate black allies to act as a bulwark against the African National Congress in the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most revealing comments are in a military intelligence report -- &quot;South African Defence Force Support to Chief Minister Buthelezi and Bishop Lekganyane&quot; -- a detailed analysis of how important it was for the preservation of apartheid to build a paramilitary capacity against the ANC around these two conservative leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The document, drawn up on 19 December 19 1985 just before a critical State Security Council meeting called to approve Operation Marion, says it had become clear &quot;the internal unrest situation cannot only be characterised as a black-white struggle and that part of the unrest is the result of a power struggle between black groups.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is important that a large portion of the black population is currently not prepared to accept the expansion of the Charterist movement and is willing to actively resist this activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If the Charterists succeed in neutralising Inkatha, it is unlikely that the other groups will be able to withstand the pressure against them. The end result of this will be that the government will only have the whites as a bastion against the revolutionary onslaught on the Republic of South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The document describes how urgent it was to provide Buthelezi and Lekganyane -- who were estimated to have a total following of some seven million people -- with paramilitary forces which could be used against the ANC-UDF. &quot;Inkatha and the ZCC's willingness to actively resist revolutionary elements provides a golden opportunity for the State to pull a meaningful and influential section of the black population into a counter- insurgency and mobilisation programme.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It describes, in detail, how a covert military unit could be supplied to Inkatha but emphasises this collaboration between the Zulu nationalist movement and the SADF had to be kept secret so Buthelezi's image as an anti- apartheid leader would not be tarnished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Open SADF support to Chief Minister Buthelezi and Bishop Lekganyane will clearly have a negative impact on their power base and must not be overlooked. Any support must be clandestine or covert. Not one of the leaders must, as a result of SADF support, be branded as marionettes of the South African government by the enemy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another section of the same document warns strongly of the possibility Buthelezi could change sides. &quot;There must be vigilance against any plan that can create a potential monster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Later documents refer repeatedly to the need for covert support to prevent Buthelezi from being seen as a &quot;marionette&quot; and at least one of the papers shows the Inkatha leader actively collaborated with the military to make sure his image as a bona-fide nationalist leader was not compromised by his willingness to become a surrogate for Pretoria's military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A secret report dated October 16 1986 and drawn up by Brigadier John More, one of Malan's co-accused, says Buthelezi expressed extreme gratitude to the SADF late in 1986 after the first batch of paramilitary fighters had been trained and sent back to KwaZulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More notes &quot;the Chief Minister is worried about his image and that he recently had to criticise (Defence Minister) General Malan because of certain statements he made but these comments were made with tongue-in- cheek&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Buthelezi did not respond at the time of going to press to queries about the apparent role he played in disguising that he and his movement were used by the military as puppets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The documents indicate the State Security Council operated on a need-to-know basis and careful effort was made to ensure there was no written evidence that cabinet members on the council -- including Deputy President FW de Klerk -- knew of plans to create an offensive military unit which would take part in violent attacks on UDF members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However it becomes clear from the papers that members of the State Security Council knew it was illegal, in terms of laws governing the self-governing homelands, for South Africa to supply any of these mini-states with an army or military force. Attorney General Tim McNally indicated in papers that the creation of a paramilitary force in KwaZulu-Natal was criminal because it contravened Law 21 of 1971 which prohibited aid of the kind given to Buthelezi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> De Klerk declined to comment on queries about whether he and his cabinet colleagues knew they were breaking the law when the State Security Council approved Operation Marion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> McNally put new particulars before the court -- in which Malan and 19 co-accused are charged with setting up the paramilitary unit which carried out the 1987 Kwamakhuta massacre -- accusing former army chief Kat Liebenberg of providing &quot;false evidence to the Goldstone Commission during 1992&quot; about his knowledge of the Inkatha unit trained in the Caprivi Strip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> McNally accused Liebenberg of lying to the commission &quot;in order to conceal his personal role and the role of the Defence Force in relation to the Caprivi trainees&quot;. Goldstone's probe into the activities of the Caprivi 200, as the unit came to be known, was set up after the Mail &amp; Guardian published evidence that members of this band were murdering people in Natal and the Transvaal in the early 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another startling allegation contained in new details presented by McNally this week is that military officers involved in Operation Marion discussed murdering the leader of the Caprivi 200, Daluxolo Luthuli, because they feared he was leaking information about the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luthuli defected from Inkatha last year and provided the KZN based Investigative Task Unit with critical information which led to the arrest of Malan and the co- accused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> McNally said former Durban security policeman Major Louis Botha &quot;intimated&quot; to Caprivi instructor JP Opperman that Luthuli had &quot;become a security risk in that he was disclosing details of Operation Marion to parties outside those who had become involved in such operation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> McNally alleges Botha &quot;recommended&quot; (to Opperman) Luthuli be killed but this advice was never carried out.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fred M'membe, editor-in-chief of The Post, and managing editor Bright Mwape were arrested on Monday on the orders of Dr Robinson Nabulyato, the speaker of Chiluba's Parliament, who also ordered they be detained &quot;for an indefinite period&quot; without trial. They are to appear in court on Tuesday after a habeas corpus writ, which limits the right of the state to detain prisoners without trial, was served on Wednesday this week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Until then, they remain in custody. On Wednesday, Zambian Home Affairs Minister Chitalu Sampa published a statement in the state-owned Zambia Daily Mail saying the journalists were common criminals and would not be released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The speaker is empowered to order a detention in terms of the Protection of Parliamentary Privileges Act, a law inherited from British colonial rule.  Lawyer Sakibwa Sikota believes the law has not been invoked in Britain since the 18th century, and that it is at odds with civil liberties provisions in the present Zambian constitution. The law will be tested against the constitution at a supreme court hearing in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, the speaker ordered the arrest and detention of M'membe, Mwape, and columnist Lucy Sichone, in connection with a column written by Sichone. Sichone did not report to Parliament for arrest with her colleagues on Monday, and her whereabouts are still unknown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the column, published on January 29, Sichone defends a supreme court ruling which served to strike down as unconstitutional certain sections of Zambia's Public Order Act, which limited the right of citizens to hold public gatherings. Vice-president Godfrey Miyanda spoke out in Parliament against the court's decision. Sichone's column lambasts Miyanda for questioning the authority of the court, particularly since it was the only courageous judicial intervention which secured Miyanda a fair trial when he was detained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The arrest of M'membe and Mwape is the culmination of an increasingly acrimonious relationship between The Post and the Chiluba government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Chiluba's Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) was campaigning for the 1991 elections, The Post's recently-founded predecessor The Weekly Post was one of the few newspapers which was with him in his denunciation of corruption and incompetence by the Kenneth Kaunda government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Chiluba ever thought The Post's opposition to Kaunda would make the paper a natural supporter for his own government, he was wrong. The Post demonstrated its independence by refusing to let the new rulers get away with corruption or hypocrisy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The result was what The Post's staff see as a systematic campaign against the paper, which ranged from members of the MMD youth league storming The Post's office and threatening journalists, to a catalogue of criminal charges against the paper's employees. Sikota said he could not remember exactly how many charges were still outstanding against M'membe, in addition to the decree by the speaker, but there were at least eight. The most recent was a charge of criminal libel after the paper suggested that one of Chiluba's aides was untrustworthy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mosautso Phiri, who is acting as editor in M'membe's absence, said the harassment of the paper began in earnest in the middle of last year, when The Post suggested Chiluba had been born in Zaire, not Zambia. This followed attempts by the government to keep Kaunda out of future presidential elections on the grounds he had been born in Malawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The circumstances of M'membe and Mwape's detention were also extraordinary. Normally, the commissioner of prisons decides where prisoners are to be held, but in this case the chief inspector of police intervened and ordered Mwape be imprisoned in Kabwe, more than 100km from Lusaka. Sikota believes the government is deliberately trying to keep M'membe and Mwape apart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In its haste to secure an arrest, Zambian police last week arrested two Post photographers and a security guard -- all male -- claiming to have mistaken them for the wanted journalists, despite the fact that Sichone is a woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government mouthpiece the Zambia Daily Mail also accused the German embassy in Lusaka of sheltering the journalists -- an accusation denied by ambassador Peter Schmidt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also, while the speaker claims to have the powers to impose an &quot;indefinite&quot; sentence on the journalists, Phiri says the law under which they were arrested does not allow for more than a year's jail sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's Department of Foreign Affairs has also expressed concern over the arrests, as have opposition parties in Zambia. A member of the Zambia Democratic Congress said: &quot;Chiluba is a worse dictator than his predecessor, who, at his very worst, never did what his government has done this week&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - As medical investigations wound their way this week to the predictable conclusion that President Nelson Mandela was fitter than most men of his age, a sense of crisis infused the presidency as the realisation dawned that the question of who will succeed him would have to be dealt with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There have been informal discussions about this for some time,&quot; an insider said. But there has never been a time when the issue of succession was raised so prominently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The central dilemma for the ANC is how to signal, ahead of the movement's own democratic decision-making procedures, to South Africa and the world at large that there will be a smooth transition -- and to do this without giving the impression that Mandela is about to hang up his boots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Financial commentators believe the rand's shudders have less to do with Mandela's health than with the need for confidence in government's fiscal policies. But whatever the state of his health, he is still a man of 77. The question of his successor -- and the way the transition is handled -- is of critical importance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Discussions -- as yet informal -- are underway at the highest level, within both the ANC and government, over how to effect as smooth a transition as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At present, there appears to be no consensus on how the transition should be managed. But the prevailing view is that Thabo Mbeki will get the job -- and that there will be no bruising contest between him and his chief rival, ANC secretary general and constitutional assembly co- chair, Cyril Ramaphosa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At 43, Ramaphosa is 10 years younger than Mbeki. He will definitely get a Cabinet post once the Constitution is completed, almost certainly a senior one -- his qualities are impossible to overlook. But those who know him say he sees the matter of Mbeki's succession as decided and would not risk the political damage of a contest, preferring to bide his time and possibly run once Mbeki has served a term, or possibly two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An indication could be given at the ANC's next national congress at the end of 1997, when there will be fresh elections for office-bearers. Mandela has said he will see his term as president out, but under discussion is the suggestion that Mandela step aside as ANC president and let Mbeki assume the mantle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This would be a way of signalling continuity. The panic over Mandela's health and who will succeed him underestimates the maturity of the ANC and the calibre of its senior leadership,&quot; a source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet 20 months is a long time in politics. &quot;Maybe Mbeki becomes ANC president at that moment, then again, maybe not, because it will be an emotional issue and in the ANC there is a feeling that the head of state should lead the movement,&quot; said an insider. &quot;If there was some hope of Ramaphosa getting it, he may be tempted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the past six to eight months, work has been done to move Mbeki to the centre of the political stage and to eliminate any impression that there may be a contest between him and Ramaphosa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Suggestion of a contest could cause problems -- not because of the individuals' involved but because Mandela wants the stability he has created to continue,&quot; an insider said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbeki is now formally in charge of seeing the ANC's goal of transformation is achieved. His public statements, programmes and activities indicate that increasingly he is in charge of the day-to-day running of the country, and that Mandela -- while not relinquishing his control -- is focusing more on what he sees as his primary task, nation-building and reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is expected to devote more and more time to this as he approaches the end of his term of office: he more-or- less said so when he addressed Potchefstroom University students recently, spelling out what he said would be his &quot;last testament&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Mbeki has strengths Mandela does not have,&quot; said an insider. &quot;Mandela is the statesman of the century, but Mbeki has perhaps a better strategic capacity and the abiliity to direct in terms of width and depth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the ANC, a key problem is to ensure that Mbeki is seen by the black majority as a promoter of militant change and also embodies the spirit of nation-building and reconciliation that emanates from Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Insiders say Mbeki is making broad strategic inputs in the ANC's national executive committee -- he wrote many of the discussion documents and position papers that have emerged -- and is engaged with organisational matters, dealing with ANC premiers on provincial matters on a political level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In government, he is acting as a de facto prime minister. Ministers report to him on their line-functions. He is in charge of Cabinet affairs for the ANC and chairs most Cabinet meetings, alternating with De Klerk. He has adopted a hands-on approach to the RDP, shoring up minister Jay Naidoo with the necessary political clout to get departments moving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have to systematically now complete the package -- - then the question of succession will no longer be an issue,&quot; an insider said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Concerns include dealing with perceptions of Mbeki being weak and tardy.  Big business -- who attitudes are often voiced by the NP and DP -- question his credentials. Others say that he is efficient, but stretched too thin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An astute politician well-schooled in the Byzantine politics of the ANC in exile, Mbeki likes to keep channels to influential players and tendencies within the ANC open. This is often interpreted as an expedient wooing of factions. He is also criticised for pushing people for Cabinet posts because they are allies, rather than the best person for the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some within the ANC say he lacks charisma, though dealing with this will be an issue for his image-builders. Since November, he has been campaigning in KwaZulu- Natal, addressing rallies and small community meetings, in a bid to carve an image as a man of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You can't reinvent Mandela, who is in a class of his own. But we do need a leader who inspires the same kind of trust and confidence that he will take the country forward,&quot; said a source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The issue of what happens after Mandela has been discussed within the South African Communist Party. At this stage, it appears the party will not engage in campaigning around a candidate. &quot;We're not a feudal organisation.  We don't want to make crown princes. We are committed to building a collective leadership,&quot; a source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the event of Mandela's sudden death, Mbeki would become acting president. The ANC's national working committee would come up with proposals to be confirmed by a meeting of the national executive committee. It would be up to Parliament to vote a new president within 30 days of the vacancy arising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the past six to eight months, work has been done to move Mbeki to centre of the political stage and to eliminate any impression that there may be a contest between him and Ramaphosa.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg) March 8, 1996 by Rehana Rossouw</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - It's hard to regard a man who jets across a continent and back in three days, gets to bed after 1am, then chirps energetically at the media seven hours later, as a geriatric. But at 77 years and seven months, Nelson Mandela is one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At that age, the degeneration of the body affects all major functions.  Yet specialists and doctors consulted by the Mail &amp; Guardian this week about the president's health are in awe of his energy and mental faculties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He's an inspiration to geriatrics all over the world. At an age where many are in retirement homes contemplating their navels, he's not only holding his own nation together but swanning across the globe solving other countries' problems,&quot; said a Cape Town physician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Monday Mandela's doctors will reveal the results of a three-day battery of tests conducted to dispel rumours of poor health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela left the Park Lane Clinic on Thursday with a clean bill of health from his physician, Dr Michael Plit. An electrocardiogram had shown his heartbeat to be &quot;textbook perfect&quot;, with no signs of coronary artery disease. X-rays indicated his lungs were in excellent condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's difficult for doctors not present at the clinic this week to identify weaknesses in the president's health, but they could provide general pointers to areas of concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most important check this week was of Mandela's cardiovascular system. If it falls outside the expected range he should be treated to reduce the risk of heart failure. Yet the risk of Mandela's suffering a heart attack is low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Older people are also significantly more likely to develop an irregular heart beat, doctors said. This can result in a stroke. Mandela's ECG would determine whether this is a problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;His favourite exercise is walking and all he really needs to do is work up a sweat three times a week through aerobic exercise like walking,&quot; said a physician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The incidence of diabetes does increase among older people, but doctors believe that if Mandela sticks to his sensible diet there is no reason for him to be at risk of contracting the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because Mandela contracted TB while in prison, his lungs will have been checked this week. He does not smoke, so lung cancer is a low risk, and there is also no cause to worry about emphysema or asthma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chances of Mandela having cancer are significantly reduced because of his lifestyle. He has had a prostatectomy, so there is no chance of prostate cancer and, because he is black, the risk of skin cancer is insignificant. He would have been screened for stomach and bowel cancer this week, though.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are only two recorded cases of black men with Alzheimer's disease in the history of medicine, so Mandela is an unlikely candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is very little likelihood he is suffering from senility. The first thing that goes is memory, long before judgment suffers. There is no sign of the president having memory problems. He makes speeches without notes and quotes extensively from previous meetings and incidents in the past,&quot; said a physician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Doctors are concerned about the stressful life Mandela leads, but, commented one, &quot;He does not strike me as a stressed person, although we have seen him come close to losing his temper a few times ... PW Botha was a prime candidate for a stroke because of the way he used to get worked up over everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Doctors believe that, unlike other politicians, Mandela is fortunate to have sustained friendships spanning decades. Many powerful men are surrounded by hangers-on basking in their glory but unavailable to support them when they are stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> University of Cape Town Professor in Geriatric Medicine Stephen Louw said although Mandela appeared unusually able to dissipate stress, he was concerned about the president's punishing schedule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;After watching the television programme A Day with the President last year, I felt it was a bit unrealistic to expect so much from him. He flew to Cape Town and back to Johannesburg late at night in one day -- that would be exhausting for most people,&quot; Louw said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His programme should be more tightly controlled, said Louw.&quot;He's obviously an immensely conscientious person who believes he must be available when needed. This may be healthy for the nation, but it could be hazardous to his health.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela's Health:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brain: While the incidence of senility and dementia does increase among older people, doctors say Mandela's public performance shows no sign of either. As a black man, the chances of his contracting Alzheimer's disease are practically non-existent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stress: Mandela may look troubled here, but doctors say that he handles stress very well</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Heart: Mandela's race, non-smoking habits, careful eating, 27-year prison diet and frequent exercise reduce the risk of a heart attack. But doctors will have checked his cholesterol and given him an ECG to see if there are any signs of an irregular heart beat</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Weight: Certainly not overweight. He exercises regularly and does not seem to have a sweet tooth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blood pressure: There is an increasing incidence of high blood pressure among South Africa's black population. If the president's pressure falls outside the expected range of between 150/90 to 160/95, he will need treatment to reduce the risk of heart failure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ankles: Some observers have noticed a slight swelling of the ankles, which can point to slight heart weakness</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eyesight: Mandela has had one minor operation for blocked tear ducts, the result of working in the Robben Island limestone quarries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hearing: He shows signs of auditory degeneration, normal at his age</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lungs: Because Mandela contracted TB while in prison, his lungs will certainly have been checked this week. There is no cause to worry about emphysema or asthma because Mandela is capable of walking long distances</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bowel and stomach: The chances of Mandela having cancer are significantly reduced because of his lifestyle. He would have been screened for stomach and bowel cancer this week, though. The other most likely forms of cancer, affecting the skin and prostate, are unlikely because he is black and has had his prostate removed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bladder: Doctors will have checked uric acid levels for any sign of kidney problems</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muscles: His muscle tone appears to be quite good and he seems strong and agile. There are no indications of some of the usual signs of age, like stumbling or falling often. 'He can probably duck quickly if someone shoots at him,' says a physician</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Diary: Too full. If there is any reason to be concerned, it is that he leads a life which would exhaust a 20 year old.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Windhoek - Sakwiba Sikota, lawyer for two editors of &quot;The Post&quot; newspaper jailed indefinitely by the Speaker of the National Assembly for being in contempt of Parliament, is to challenge his clients' conviction.  Sikota said that the procedures used by Speaker Dr Robinson Nabulyato to order the arrest of, and to pass sentence on, editor-in-chief Fred M'membe and managing editor Bright Mwape have no backing under the law. His challenge is to be heard on 12 March under a writ of habeas corpus. M'membe and Mwape handed themselves in on 4 March and are currently being held in maximum security jails, while columnist Lucy Sichone is still at large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sikota stated that under the writ of habeas corpus application, Parliament will be required to justify on what law or authority it is holding M'membe and Mwape in prison. Sikota also said that if the court is not satisfied with the reasons given, it will order the journalists' immediate release. M'membe and Mwape are expected to be present during the proceedings next week, Sikota said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sikota added that, in terms of Section 27 of National Assembly Powers and Privileges Act enacted on 28 September 1956 by the Federal Parliament of the then colonial Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, &quot;no prosecution shall be instituted for an offence under this act.&quot; Sikota, therefore, argued that the sentence passed by Nabulyato was not provided for in the 1956 Act. He further explained that once Parliament had found someone in contempt, the matter should be handed over to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). It was the DPP's duty, and not that of Parliament, to prosecute, said Sikota.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview with the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC), Sikota said his clients had never been put on trial, and that they were found &quot;guilty&quot; by Parliament in absentia. &quot;This is totally against all the rules of natural justice. Everyone is entitled to be tried by an impartial tribunal,&quot; said Sikota. In the case of the trio, Sikota said that Nabulyato and Vice-President Godfrey Miyanda &quot;played the part of accusers, prosecutors, judge and jury.&quot; Miyanda himself raised the contempt issue when &quot;The Post&quot; trio wrote about his criticism of a Supreme Court ruling that legislation requiring police permission for the holding of demonstrations was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sikota was confident the courts would order the release of his clients on constitutional grounds. The case has brought about a &quot;mini-constitutional crisis,&quot; said Sikota. &quot;The courts will have to overrule the National Assembly, as the National Assembly has obviously gone way beyond its bounds.&quot; He added: &quot;Once a court rules that they (Mwape and M'membe) are being held illegally, the prison authorities will have to release them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking on Sichone's decision not to hand herself in, Sikota further told the NBC: &quot;Sichone's position is that she cannot be party to what she clearly sees as an illegal act, and answer to a warrant (for her arrest) with no constitutional backing.&quot; He explained that Sichone has a three-month-old baby and so she was not willing to subject the baby to the &quot;terrible conditions&quot; found in Zambia's prisons, where cholera is prevalent this time of year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Home Affairs Minister Chitalu Sampa says M'membe and Mwape &quot;should be treated like ordinary criminals&quot; while in jail, according to the state-owned &quot;Times of Zambia&quot;. Sampa reportedly made the remarks after he was asked by &quot;The Post&quot;'s lawyers to give preferential treatment to the imprisoned editors. &quot;A prisoner is a prisoner and there is no special treatment,&quot; Sampa is reported as saying. He added that M'membe and Mwape were not political prisoners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BACKGROUND: The three had been lying low since they were found guilty by Speaker Nabulyato of being in contempt of Parliament. On 27 February, Nabulyato sentenced the three to indefinite imprisonment under the Protection of Parliamentary Privileges Act, legislation dating back to British colonial rule. On 29 February, police offered a reward of Kwacha 2 million (US$ 2000) for information leading to the arrest of the three.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York - In a brief hearing on 23 February 1996, Circuit Court Judge Nuhu Bila granted bail in the amount of 6 million cedis (US$ 4,000) for journalists Nana Kofi Coomson, editor-in-chief of &quot;The Ghanaian Chronicle&quot;, Eben Quarcoo, editor of weekly &quot;The Free Press&quot;, and Tommy Thompson, publisher of &quot;The Free Press&quot;. The three journalists posted sureties and were unconditionally released.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judge Bila also announced that he was referring the constitutional issues of the case to the Supreme Court. The case is to be adjourned indefinitely until the Supreme Court renders a decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Ofosu-Amah, counsel for the defendants, stated that the issues to be addressed in the near future will include: the viability of old laws and their enforcement under the country's new constitution; an examination of existing Supreme Court laws and to what extent they are media friendly; and a plan to highlight the laws that are believed to be unconstitutional with regard to freedom of expression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BACKGROUND: Coomson, Quarcoo, and Thompson were charged with &quot;publishing false news with the intent of injuring the reputation of the State,&quot; a violation of Section 185 of the Criminal Code of 1960, an ordinance of the colonial era. Both &quot;The Free Press&quot; and &quot;The Ghanaian Chronicle&quot; reprinted in their 31 January and 1 February editions, respectively, a story published in the New York-based bi-weekly &quot;The African Observer&quot; reporting that Ghanaian diplomat Frank Benneh, of the Ghanaian Permanent Mission to the United Nations in Geneva, had been arrested in Switzerland for selling drugs. The article also alleged that the government of President Jerry Rawlings had used proceeds from illegal drug sales to buy arms.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Government does not necessarily have to reach the 4.6m eligible voters target and will go ahead and prepare a voters' roll without it, an official has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Public liaison officer at elections office, Joel Sikazwe, said in an interview yesterday that the exercise would not be extended.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's not numbers that matter although the extensions were done due to the outcry from interested parties. This time nobody is advocating an extension,&quot; Sikazwe said, and added: &quot;The figures we have are merely target figures but if we fail to achieve them we shall go ahead and prepare the voters' roll.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sikazwe was reacting to calls to extend the voters' registration exercise which ends today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foundation for Democratic Process (FODEP) president, Reverend Foston Sakala, made the appeal on Tuesday during ZNBC's radio programme Tell the Nation .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If we score less than 50 per cent at the end of the exercise, then the government will have no chance but to allow the exercise to go on until we reach at least 50 per cent of the figure of eligible voters,&quot; Sakala said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said government should only consider closing the exercise after 60 per cent was recorded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The exercise which started in December last year has already been extended twice but has registered only 1.6m of the eligible 4.6m voters by February 9.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By last week, government claimed 2.1 million people had registered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Nikuv computers project manager, Gershon Korda, said his company is willing to continue with the exercise if they are asked to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are ready to continue with the voters' registration exercise at any time if we are asked to do so by government because they are our employers,&quot; Korda said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Leader of the opposition Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) has called on President Chiluba to resign from presidency for misgoverning the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZDC president, Dean Mung'omba, also asked donors to impose sanctions on Chiluba's government before the country falls into a major disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He made the call yesterday at a press briefing where he listed many ills affecting the nation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mung'omba said his party has considered the crisis facing the nation and is convinced that unless immediate and concrete steps are taken to remedy the situation the country will meet a major disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are calling upon President Chiluba, for once, to heed the nation's lament and step down as head of state to allow the creation of a transitional government to supervise matters of the state, particularly the forthcoming national elections,&quot; Mung'omba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mung'omba appealed to the donor community to impose sanctions on the Chiluba government to facilitate his resignation as President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We call upon the friends of Zambia, particularly our co-operating partners to censure and put sanctions on this regime that has, without restraint, continued to misgovern our country and is driving our people towards confrontation,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mung'omba accused the MMD government of having failed to conduct the voters' registration which he described as a disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;After 30 years of independence, and in a democracy, one would have thought the voters' registration exercise and the preparation for elections would be the easiest, but we fear violence may erupt if the whole process is not reviewed, and made transparent particularly the stakeholders,&quot; Mung'omba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ZDC president also said his party is committed to good governance and performance but will not obey unjust laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We shall not obey unjust laws such as the amendments made to the Public Order Act,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the amendment of the Public Order Act is gross contempt of the judiciary and makes the mockery of this democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;ZDC will seek redress in the courts of law against this parliamentary treachery, and we call upon the people of Zambia to continue enjoying their rights as provided for in our constitution,&quot; Mung'omba said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Securities Exchange Commission is holding talks with the Central Bank on possibilities of phasing out the high yielding 28-day treasury bills in a bid to attract institutional investors participation on the Lusaka Stock Exchange (SEC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SEC chief executive, Mumba Kapumpa disclosed in an interview yesterday that the move was prompted by the limited participation of institutional investors at LuSE who had opted to invest in treasury bills for quick returns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are discussing with Bank of Zambia on the possibilities of phasing out the twenty eight day treasury bills or increasing interest rates on the 180 day bills,&quot; Kapumpa disclosed explaining that: &quot;Most institutional investors have opted to put their money in the former and avoiding participation on the Lusaka Stock Exchange hence the little activity,&quot; Kapumpa disclosed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SEC and the LuSE held meetings with the financial institutions and pension funds to encourage their participation on the capital markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The meeting was very successful and the institutions have shown commitment and in addition to that next month we will be holding a seminar for managers in these institutions,&quot; Kapumpa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among those who attended the meeting were Zambia National Provident Fund, Civil service Pensions Board, Mukuba Pensions board and the central bank governor, Jacob Mwanza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also commenting on the meeting LuSE general manger, Charles Mate echoed Kapumpa's call on financial institution's participation on the capital markets.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Zambia Privatisation Trust Fund manager, Thomas Ryan has disclosed that the floatation of the remaining 10 per cent Zambia Breweries shares to the public has been rescheduled to next year because of the current poor prices of shares on the LuSE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ryan was speaking during a Zambia Privatisation Agency Forum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We hope to float the shares on the Lusaka Stock Exchange next year unlike the earlier announced second quarter of this year due to the poor performance of shares on the stock market,&quot; Ryan said adding: &quot;The shares will remain in the trust fund hands until our trustees view a rise in demand and price.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Association general secretary, Hermann Mpashi, who sounded the warning at a press brief yesterday , also warned of tough measures against local clubs not following the laid down regulations in getting players from other teams.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Clubs and players are given a timely warning that the executive committee shall severely punish clubs and players not complying with the standard procedures,&quot; Mpashi said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia's 1995 Footballer of the Year, Dennis Lota , hardman Mordon Malitoli, Jones Mwewa and Tenant Chilumba, all went out without the knowledge of the FAZ, while Power Dynamos want to start talks with Lusaka Dynamos on defender Ronald Mukoshya after they got the player almost a month ago.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If one wants to act as a FIFA agent he should first of all apply to the Football Association of Zambia. At the moment there is no Zambian recognised agent,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - After years of struggling, Martin Nkoma alias Jah Luther, has finally popped out a make-up studio with an eight track demonstration album, &quot;Fire&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nkoma hopes to use this demo to blow his own trumpet because in the past he has just held live shows. The rhythm is all reggae.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have completed my demo tape and it has eight tracks. I am going to use this demo for my publicity. I have already taken it to the radio,&quot; said Jah Luther in his assumed Jamaican patois.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He hopes to splash his sweet raggae music on the market by March this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The songs on the demo include the title track &quot;Fire&quot;, the pumping &quot;Children Play&quot;, the bass-powered &quot;Mother Africa&quot;, the silky smooth &quot;Uncle&quot;, the moody &quot;Mighty Messenger&quot;, the emotive&quot; HIV&quot; and the laid back &quot;Chibusa&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luther explains the lyrics of &quot;Fire &quot; thus: &quot;In Fire I try to talk about life as being a flame of life, you see. Life is like a flame. We are burning, living, you see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luther was backed by the rhythm and blues band, Echo Heart to produce Fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Man I recorded Fire using a four track recorder and I also recorded it using my friend's equipment in Lusaka's Roma,&quot; Luther says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luther who is also Zambia Union of Musicians ( ZUM ) music resource center manger at Evelyn Hone College said they are working out a way of coming up with a small time studio for the musicians who use the center to be able to come out with demo albums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are going to be using a four track recorder, a key board, a rhythm composer and the equipment that we have here. At least that will help the young musicians to come up with demo tapes instead of just rehearsing for live shows,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Communications Services International (CSI) wants to have the sole right to transmit all local premiership, cup matches and matches involving both the senior and junior national teams and has offered FAZ a reasonable amount for the deal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the cash FAZ will reap will depend on the response from viewers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CSI executive Barry Lambert , currently in the country, confirmed he has had talks with FAZ and hinted that if all goes well his organisation will sign the contract for television coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;CSI is delighted to announce that it will soon be signing a contract for television coverage to Zambia and internationally with FAZ&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are going to provide coverage to the Super Division and Cup games.  CSI is a reputable television company,&quot; Lambert said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And FAZ chairman, Michael Chiti, said the contract once signed would bring revenue to the association through television rights and expose players to the European market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We will start selling players to European clubs and not countries like Saudi Arabia,&quot; Chiti said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa is a beneficiary of CSI but Zambia will be the first country in Southern Africa to benefit through the arrangement of the contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile FAZ treasurer, Musa Kasonka, has denied his association is involved in double dealings with Blue Orchid and KAM.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Does President Chiluba, as head of state need an invitation to attend?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The call by Mpezeni, the paramount chief of the Ngoni of Eastern province, to keep politics out of traditional ceremonies was timely.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was good advice to the members of the opposition UNIP, and probably Liberal Progressive Front, who are trying to make political capital out of the fact that President Fredrick Chiluba was not invited to the ceremony, he had 'invited' himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is cheap politics. Does President Chiluba, as head of state, and indeed a Zambian citizen, need an invitation to attend such a public gathering of the Ngoni people?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We appreciate it is impossible for the President to attend such a ceremony 'incognito' but that should not stop him from doing so. And if an invitation was necessary why wasn't he invited anyway? After all, President Chiluba's wife Vera, comes from Eastern province. The President is a son of Eastern province. And this should also be a good lesson for President Chiluba and his ruling MMD officials that it does not pay to politicise ceremonies or funerals in areas where they may be popular themselves. They are also guilty of this same vice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The new Super 12 competition has kicked off amid all the magic that a media circus tends to give an event which it has spawned, nursed and paid for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the top end, the Rupert Murdoch-sponsored southern hemisphere provincial competition has a lot going for it. On a more parochial level, it has some glaring inequalities to answer for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taking the cream off the milk invariably leads to the rest of the bottle having a flat and somewhat wishy-washy taste. In the context of rugby, the Currie Cup and the Ranfurly Shield have -- no matter the history, tradition and passion engendered by them -- instantly become secondary competitions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The provincial grind, the cornerstone of the game as it used to be played and the home ground of talent both nascent and hardened, has been relegated to the position of bridesmaid ... you're part of the ceremony, but not party to the action that really counts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also leads to the speculation that the personnel involved in the home- and-away competition -- something of a misnomer as a true home-and-away tournament would take up more time and money than even Murdoch would be willing to wager -- will not really alter from season to season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In South Africa, where the foot-soldiers will wear the colours they are contracted to pull over their heads, it will lead to shifts of playing staff at the end of the season when one or more of the four present Currie Cup participants is eliminated from next year's Super 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And why shouldn't they move? As in the case of soccer, the big money really comes from the European competitions. You have to be in it to win it.  The Super 12 is no different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The players worthy of a place in the Super 12 will move to sides qualified to play in the competition. They have to if they want exposure and the chance of playing for the Springboks ... for make no mistake the public will demand that the players they watch make the national side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the selectors will -- as they did consistently before Kitch Christie rattled the cage -- concentrate on the games as a feeding ground for the voracious maw of Test rugby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In short, too much emphasis has been given to the televised version of the game as it is played south of the Equator, and not enough thought has been given to the game itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is also the problem of the crowds who have turned the stadiums in this country from places to go and watch a game into mini industries with general managers, PR consultants and the like. Justifiably so, the game has changed and the people who play it are different. And those who watch it have new and varied demands in terms of entertainment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At core though -- no matter the tampering with the laws as they used to apply -- rugby remains a constant: a hard and physical contact sport which, while it may earn the select few big money for a number of years, remains a character-building exercise which produces life-long alliances. No money can change that aspect of the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What the Super 12 has effectively done is add another almost unreachable rung to the ladder leading towards the game's ideals. And, sawed off a couple of the lower rungs by producing a new stratum and lowering the status of the existing layers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No one is advocating a return to the status quo that existed before the advent of players being properly recompensed for putting their bodies on the line, or harking back to the days when administrators became more valuable than they managed or the commodity they peddled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The player must be paramount. More important than the marketing effort.  More crucial than the voice of the spokesman and more integral to the long-term growth of the product which is being put before a public with a choice of channels than anything else in the complicated equation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still, one senses that this has not been the case. At least not in this country. And we risk the scenario which has become fact in the United States, where a primary school child not good enough to make the first team at under-12 level ceases to become an active participant in what is after all a right of passage to man or womanhood -- the right to get out and enjoy oneself in the air the Lord gave us all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In America, a failure to make &quot;the cut&quot; at the most basic of levels, means that there is little chance of coming back higher up the age scale.  Spectatorship becomes the only option and screaming at those who have made the transition to TV stardom the only outlet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is the very essence of an elite that it excludes those who do not qualify for membership. The Super 12 has the definite feel of a made-for-TV spectacle which is aimed exactly at this objective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The New Zealanders -- bless their fern-lined jockstraps -- have not been slow to understand this. As well they should. For a nation which has always counted the elevation to the status of All Black higher than sainthood, they have looked further than putting the week-to-week combinations out on the field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jonah Lomu, disqualified from playing by virtue of his provincial commitments to Counties, will nevertheless compete in the colours of Auckland by virtue of the New Zealand draft system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is right that a player of Lomu's stature and ability should get the showcase the Super 12 offers. But it is the thin edge of the wedge in two respects. Firstly, it denies the Auckland winger -- or wingers -- who got the famed and fearsome side into the competition in the first place -- the opportunity to embrace a wider stage and paint on a bigger and more brightly lit canvas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And secondly, it makes a mockery of the qualifying process, opening the way to abuses beyond the comprehension of the fan who is going to pay for his ticket or his decoder. Just as a spin-off the less successful unions must surely be due for a drop in gate money. It is not the cash which is the primary worry, but the lack of bums in seats at lesser stadiums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Somehow, the verdict on the Super 12 must also include a retrospective look at the eddies which surge about a competition run by the masters of media manipulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The verdict must stay out on the tournament until these eddies have reached further shores than the fringes of the flickering light of a TV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One suspects that there is as much potential harm in what has become the major competition in our rugby lives as there is the opportunity for witnessing great players in action, great games in progress and great television in the sanctity of the living room.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The match between England and South Africa should have been a crucial, spine-tingling affair, but such is the ludicrous format of this World Cup that it is little more than a form guide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The world's premier players gather once every four years for a festival of cricket, the game's showpiece, yet for the first three weeks of competition the matches are almost meaningless, glorified exhibition games, despite the TV pundits' best efforts to enthuse us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only if one of the four minnows --Zimbabwe, Kenya, Holland and UAE -- cause an upset, and there is little sign of that so far, are the names of the quarter-finalists in doubt. This undermines the integrity of the tournament.  For example, we should have been transfixed by a contest between India and West Indies, Brian Lara pitched against Sachin Tendulkar, yet it is far more relevant to keep an eye on the progress of UAE or Kenya just to make sure they don't disturb the old order.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What a wasted opportunity, tantamount to a betrayal of cricket fans in the sub-continent, as well as the worldwide television audience. To cap it all, the matches played so far have been woefully one-sided. We must wait until March 9 and the quarter-finals for the real cricket to begin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This lamentable situation could easily have been avoided; it is another area where the International Cricket Council, anxious to be rid of their impotent image, might have intervened to ensure a format that offers a meaningful competition from first to last.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The quarter-final stage could have been scrapped; this would have meant that every preliminary game was vital, as each team strived to finish in the top two of their group to qualify for the semi-finals. Or, if this was deemed to deny the organisers too many matches and all the lovely TV and advertising lolly, they should have imitated the system used in Australia and New Zealand four years ago: one league of 10 teams (the nine Test-playing countries plus one minnow, the winner of the ICC Trophy), who would play each other once.  The top four would then contest the semi-finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As it is, the teams are indulging in a phony war prior to March 9. The crazy format is highlighted by the fact that Australia and West Indies can forfeit their games against Sri Lanka without damaging their chances of winning the tournament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There have been some vignettes to savor. The South African fielding has been breathtaking and Sachin Tendulkar, with 290 impish runs in three knocks, has already reminded us that Lara has a serious challenger. Their much- hyped duel in Gwalior never materialised, but compare the two little geniuses in the field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tendulkar was constantly animated, cajoling his teammates and forever in conversation with his captain, Azharuddin, suggesting this and that. Lara, in contrast, still looked a forlorn figure, subdued and remote at first slip as West Indies were humbled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the same game, Azharuddin, at the age of 33, fielded like a colt and snatched a stunning catch at midwicket, while Anil Kumble produced a masterful spell of aggressive spin bowling. He did not set out to contain but to bamboozle unsuspecting opponents. Magic moments, but how much better it would be if they had occurred in matches that really matter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The new-look SABC has some distance to travel before its revamped schedules are up to scratch. While television head Jill Chisholm is by-and-large pleased with the relaunch, she concedes that schedule times have to be fine- tuned, signal distribution reviewed and the transmission footprint redefined, if viewers in all nine provinces are to capture the revised SABC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chisholm is not only editor-in-chief of television news, but also wears the hat of acting chief executive. She had to fill the latter post a mere five months after being appointed head of news in July last year. As acting chief executive, she is responsible for all three channels on SABC, the sports division and the former Safritel, now called SABC Productions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Critics have charged her with being &quot;power hungry&quot; and &quot;overly ambitious&quot;, but Chisholm says she is not intent on holding down both positions. She is, by her own admission, spreading herself too thin and is, therefore, unable to dedicate enough time and effort to various projects and people. &quot;But the decision is not in my hands. It rests with Zwelakhe Sisulu,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When asked if she was happy with the new schedules, Chisholm said it was not her function to be pleased about programmes and laughed. If it were all up to her, there would have been fewer game shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chisholm said news coverage would be improved, and she highlighted a few of the changes planned at the SABC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SABC news was establishing its first foreign desk where foreign news would be sifted and reported. &quot;I believe South Africans are no longer as introspective as before and viewers are interested to know what's happening in the rest of the world. We will also be developing more African news. We are part of the continent, after all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chisholm is also critical of the standards of local journalism and says &quot;certain improvements&quot; need to be made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I hate news diaries and think we should be probing news rather than just reporting it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On viewers' responses to the new-look SABC, Chisholm said time and patience was needed. She said there were problems with pockets of the country unable to receive Channel 3 because of the SABC's limited footprint in the Eastern Cape and Kwazulu-Natal, while signal distribution in the Western Cape also needed attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think we have to allow time for programmes to settle down and for audiences to become accustomed to all the changes,&quot; she says, before admitting that she was, however, &quot;singularly pleased&quot; that indigenous language programmes were attracting the audiences it was aimed at.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Average ratings have been positive overall and Sesotho programmes have, in particular, captured a wide audience which was prevously not catered for by the SABC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some viewers had complained about changed time schedules. Certain soapies like Santa Barbara had to be shifted from the traditional 4 and 5.30pm slots to mid-afternoon, spurring complaints from an &quot;amazing number of women&quot;, Chisholm said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Other than that, I often hear people saying they have to choose between two programmes on different channels and that is a start in the right direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chisholm said it usually takes about three months for new schedules to settle in and that it was a bit premature to try and gauge the success or shortcomings of the new SABC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Although the SABC is planning more changes, we must first get a feel on changes we have already made. We are committed to expanding local production and I think we have to be more daring with local projects if we are to move away from the mainstream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The SABC lacks a distinctiveness apparent at other public broadcasters.  We need the type of television that is unique to South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the SABC was officially awarded a third channel by the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Communications two weeks ago, it will be able to continue work on fulfilling its mandate of spreading the 11 languages equitably across these channels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chisholm welcomed the decision and will be promoting Channel 3 more than before. Some advertisers believe it could become the flagship of the SABC. As a predominantly English language channel, its bid would be to attract more black audiences. But Chisholm said she did not want to duplicate the former TV1 flagship situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The portfolio committee stipulated that it favoured seeing competition with other broadcasters sooner rather than later. The competition from terrestrial channels will be welcomed, as it will force competitors in the arena to improve and maintain the quality of television programming,&quot; Chisholm said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The committee said two more channels specifically for independent broadcasters would be introduced by mid-next year, but this did not faze Chisholm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She believes that the advertising pie will be sufficient to fulfill the needs of all channels. &quot;Various channels attract advertising by the quality of their audiences and the type of audience you gather depends on the quality of your programmes. All this puts you on your mettle and will lead to healthy competition for advertising revenue,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While other public broadcasters are funded from the fiscal budget, the SABC is a unique hybrid where funding is generated by television licenses and self-generated revenue. Chisholm feels government could assist in collecting license fees by, perhaps, incorporating it into municipal service bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chisholm stresses that it is extremely difficult to try and provide all services to all people in 11 languages on generated revenue, because to even make and promote local production was expensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chisholm has made her presence felt and proven her mettle within the corporation by steadfastly making changes to news and current affairs programmes and internally revamping and publicly relaunching the SABC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But her critics are patiently waiting in the wings to see whether she'll successfully pull off her mandate and establish the SABC as not only a representative, but also a quality programme broadcaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In her first firm address to staffers seven months ago, Chisholm was quoted as saying that mistakes, although understandable, were only allowed to happen once. Whether the SABC's single major mistake -- a footprint which fails to deliver in the appropriate languages to certain groupings -- will be rectified remains to be seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although recommendations have been forwarded to the Independent Broadcasting Authority, critics and viewers wait with bated breath.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - South African sport has rapidly become a mega- business.  With the success of the national rugby, soccer and cricket teams and the advent of 24-hour international television sports channels, local sport has caught up with world trends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barry Smith, marketing director of South African Breweries (SAB), by far South Africa's largest sports sponsor, reckons the cost of TV rights has increased five-fold over the past two years, while sponsorship has also gone up dramatically. However, sponsors are becoming selective as costs rise.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All manner of new corporate sponsors have entered the sporting arena, in the belief that they can link its marketing to South Africa's reconstruction and development. Says one sponsor: &quot;Firms that have not had previous interest are now using sport to get into government's good books.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) managing director Ali Bacher notes that the international TV rights to coverage of next summer's cricket tours by both the Indians and Australians have been sold for four times the amount of the recent England tour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rupert Murdoch's Star TV has bought the Indian tour rights and his Channel Seven has bought the Australian tour rights for what is believed to be R20 to R30-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bacher says no package has been arranged with Murdoch. &quot;Each tour is negotiated separately. We have no long-term agreement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Television is by far the largest revenue earner in cricket, compared with the recent past when gate receipts and sponsorship contributed more.  Total gate revenue from the five test and seven one-day international series against the English was R12,9-million despite losing almost eight days (owing to rain and the early finish to the Newlands test). Some 250 000 spectators watched the tests compared with 170 000 who watched the three Australian tests in 1993/94.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of the revenue from the cricket tests, 20% goes to UCBSA's development programme, 10% to UCBSA and 70% to the provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cricket is bigger than soccer, which relies more on gate receipts than sponsors and TV. But this could change, following the victory of the South African team at the African Cup of Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tournament had gate receipts of R6,6- million from 370 000 spectators. Its total revenue was R23-million. In addition to the gate receipts, R8-million was from government, R4-million from TV rights, R3-million from the Confederation of African Football, R2,3- million from seven suppliers and R600 000 from license royalties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Total costs amounted to R22-million, leaving a R1-million surplus for the South African Football Association. The costs included R5- million for marketing, R4-million for accommodation, R4-million for the 1 900 media contingent and 6 000 other accredited officials (including R1,6-million for media facilities); R2,5-million for security; R2,4- million for travel; R2-million for the hire of the four stadiums; and R1,7-million for internal transport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the biggest sport in South Africa is still rugby. By comparison, the Rugby World Cup made around R133-million profit on earnings of R270-million (60% of which was from the commercial programme) and expenses of R140- million. Of the profit, R26,5-million went to the South African Rugby Football Union (the rest to the Rugby World Cup), which in turn is committed to putting 40% of its portion into development of the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bacher is not prepared to disclose cricket's sponsorship and TV revenue (the latter is thought to be R8-million for the England tour). He adds the figures are not audited in a manner that reflects any profit/loss from tours.  &quot;UCBSA takes 10% to cover our costs. We do not accumulate proceeds.&quot; UCBSA has R10- million in the kitty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Local cricket's windfall is expected to come from hosting the 2003 World Cup. The present World Cup is expected to yield a $50-million profit for unions of the three host countries -- India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To cover the costs of the South African team taking part in the current World Cup, it receives R1,475-million which includes the player and management salaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As for the players, participating in the national teams means substantial wealth -- top rugby players can earn R1-million/year excluding sponsorships; top cricketers about R750 000, including private sponsorships; and soccer players around R200 000.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The appointment of Graca Machel to the Thebe Investment Corporation's (TIC) board should ensure it a first bite at Mozambique's privatisation cherry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Litha Nyhonyha, executive director of TIC and chief executive officer of its financial arm, Msele Financial Holdings, said the new appointments underline TIC's intention to be a major player in the southern African region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Having people such as Machel and Stride Masiyiwa (chairman of Retrofit Holdings of Zimbabwe) on the board means we have a direct line to developments in those countries and are well placed to capitalise on new opportunities as they come up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In addition, original input from people in the know helps us to diversify in the right areas and maximise our growth potential,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An obvious first choice for Thebe is Mozambique's airline, which is high up on the country's privatisation list and offers the complementarily that Thebe seeks. Its South African Express offshoot already flies to Namibia and Livingstone in Zambia, primarily for the tourism market. With tourism seen as a potential growth area for Mozambique, the synergy could be substantial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thebe Properties is also looking beyond South Africa's borders for possible investment openings, as is Thebe's financial services division.  Moves in Zimbabwe to relax controls on foreign investment are to be welcomed, says Nyhonyha, and should help the company to unlock growth potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Plans for Angola are still very much at the drawing-board stage, but options are being studied in trading, possibly in primary commodities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - South Africa's corporate standards are being polluted by corruption, and the toll on the country is far higher than the mere monetary value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, corruption in Nigeria was initially accepted as a way of &quot;getting the job done&quot; -- and so the cost of corruption was less than its monetary value because it had spin-offs of greater efficiency, explained Professor Lawrence Schlemmer of the Nedcor Project on Crime, Violence and Investment, at the fourth annual conference on fraud hosted by Compact Business Systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But, of course, today Nigeria's society and economy is crippled by corruption and it is plainly costing more than its monetary price,&quot; he added.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although statistics were unreliable, Schlemmer said corruption in South Africa was surging and estimated that serious economic offences in South Africa were up to three times higher than in Britain relative to the economy.  &quot;Just looking at commercial branch cases, between 1992 and 1995, there was a 60% real increase in the amounts involved in fraud.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He attributed the increase in fraud, in part, to the transition the country has undergone. &quot;Also to blame are skill shortages and high rates of emigration, which result in controlling agencies running out of human resources,&quot; said Schlemmer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other factors, such as the general increase in crime, have resulted in more police entering the private security sector, further depleting the personnel in the various police commercial branches available to fight fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senior superintendent Frik Kitching of Gauteng's commercial crime unit said the unit had lost a lot of personnel to the private sector. &quot;It's an enormous problem because we can't compare to private sector rates, in order to keep our investigators, in whom we've invested time and money on training.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But whatever the cause, said Schlemmer, corruption is at an unacceptably high level and the money cost thereof is higher than all other crime combined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also of concern, is that as much as 60% of corruption is committed by people in management positions, whereas in other countries it is mainly carried out by people in salaried employee positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So how much is it really costing South Africa? Schlemmer said the state was the victim in about 33% of serious economic offences in South Africa, far higher than in countries such as the UK, the United States, France or Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Including tax evasion, fraud, tariff scams and financial irregularities, the state may be penalised by as much as R25-billion a year, which equals 17% of the 1994/95 budget,&quot; commented Schlemmer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He pointed out that this is roughly the size of South Africa's interest payments on the state debt -- &quot;one of the factors crippling our capacity to improve the lot of the people&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In essence, said Schlemmer, the combination of interest and corruption means that of South Africa's state financial system, some 35% is being spent on things it shouldn't be spending money on, if society had better controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The state, he said, may fight back by robbing investment capital which, along with high taxes, is imposing a huge penalty on a country that needs investment capital to grow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another serious implication for South Africa, if corruption continued unabated, is the damage caused to growth opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Overseas countries may become cautious about risking investment in a country whose reputation for serious economic offences are growing. So, corruption is costing South Africa more all round than its financial value,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Thabo Mbeki's ambitious blueprint for economic growth and job creation brings into sharp focus the need for the &quot;right&quot; Budget on March 13. Without the building blocks to encourage foreign and local investment, the government's strategy will fall at the first hurdle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The deputy president's speech to the inter- governmental forum went further than most by setting out, for the first time, specific targets for growth and employment creation. And while commentators and business leaders welcomed its contents in principle, there was skepticism at how it would be put into practice.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is indeed a tall order. With unemployment at 40% South Africa cannot afford to do nothing. Says Jayendra Naidoo, executive director of Nedlac: &quot;We have got to produce jobs in a hurry; no society can expect stability with unemployment that high. So we are looking at public works programmes as a way of mopping up some of the excess unemployment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbeki highlighted certain sectors of the economy as being the new growth generators, especially tourism and exports. The danger of such targeted incentives is that comparative advantage is ignored, with possible increases in inefficiencies, says Dennis Dykes, chief economist of Nedcor. The best growth incentives are lower taxes to attract &quot;bricks and mortar&quot; investment, which creates more long-term jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Says Leslie Boyd, Anglo-American deputy chairman and head of Business SA: &quot;The very high rates of corporate tax are a serious impediment to investment, both by local and foreign firms. Government must consider dropping the secondary tax on companies, or at least bringing it down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Economists stress the need for a stable fiscal climate to encourage growth; any startling moves in the next Budget could frighten off foreign investors. Adam Jacobs, Amalgamated Banks of South Africa (Absa) economist, says government must cut its dis-saving, control expenditure and improve efficiencies -- in other words, maintain a robust discipline over its finances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Personal tax levels are another contentious issue, with fiscal drag a severe block on efficiency and productivity. Government promises to alleviate the effect of fiscal drag have still not materialised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a &quot;new deal&quot;, when the details emerge next month, is unlikely to feature the type of Keynesian kick-start favoured in the United States and Europe 30 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Essop Pahad, political adviser to Mbeki, stressed that fiscal discipline was still high on the government's agenda, although he implied that the budget deficit was not of the magnitude that would scare off foreign investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a case for arguing that fiscal responsibility is more important than fiscal discipline. Unemployment and crime, says one economist, are far less sustainable in the long run than budget deficits --- and by far the biggest impediments to growth in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, &quot;if the government is serious about creating a climate conducive to long-term growth, it should concentrate less on market forces and more on law and order&quot;, said one analyst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But whatever the nuts and bolts of Mbeki's &quot;masterplan&quot;, the onus is on Minister of Finance Chris Liebenberg to send the right signals to the foreign and local investment community.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The starting point of staging a live music event is deceptively simple. But simply having an idea is not enough for enthusiasts or opportunists. Festivals need funds, and financial input from the public and private sectors is a feature of festivals internationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the event that a sponsor is sought, it is necessary to ensure that the artistic direction of the festival is compatible with the sponsor's products or services. If public money is to be used, the direction will need to satisfy social policies. Choice of artists and repertoire must relate to the identified target audience, and if the event is to be filmed or broadcast, the &quot;remote&quot; or &quot;viewing&quot; audience must also be considered.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So often, South Africans have witnessed the demise of grandiose music promotions, whose implementation was based on the assumption that the event would be so &quot;big&quot; that it would automatically warrant extensive media interest, advertising and media sponsors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The organisers then get locked into a classic catch-22 situation: potential sponsors want to see the big names, but funds are not at hand to make the deposits required to secure the artist booking. As this process plays itself out, the clock ticks, and the practical aspects of organisation -- technical production, logistics, venue bookings, media, and marketing -- are neglected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A full-blown, multi-artist festival ideally requires a minimum of a year's preparation from the point when the financial commitments are in place -- in writing. Production costs are greatly influenced by the selection of artists and venues, and these need to be finalised and meticulously costed beforehand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ticket prices have to be realistic for the market, and the show's production should never be dependent on &quot;ticket rollover&quot; for running costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cash flow needs to be carefully planned, and it is essential that the promoter or organiser have funds at hand to keep all aspects of pre- production to schedule. Delays in payments to key suppliers (such as sound companies or venues) can easily sink a festival. Show- business professionals sniff out a shaky promoter and quickly opt for other work if deadlines are not honoured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A festival organiser has to co-ordinate a myriad activities, typically including transport and logistics (from international air schedules and freighting to the runners moving between venues and hotels), accounts (foreign exchange applications, trade exchanges), merchandising (to be negotiated, manufactured, marketed), technical production (including site preparation, staging, sound, lighting), security, media and hospitality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The festival staff should include personnel who are experienced in their respective fields and can speak with authority, thereby commanding the respect of the management or crew of a top-league visiting artist. Any experienced music promoter knows that the job ordinarily necessitates being available right round the clock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A well-planned festival will have its production strategy worked out with military precision during the pre-production phase. Staffing must be finalised, and staff and artists should be issued with a handbook detailing contacts for each venue (this is to avoid the visiting guitarist from hassling the accountant for a herbal tea bag). Successful production is based on having the right technical and human resources in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Without contracts and funds in place to provide the financial anchor for a festival, there will never be time to collate the production information. A domino effect results, which is chaotic and costly. For example, until plane flights are booked, there will be no confirmed arrival times, and hotel bookings cannot be confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ultimately, keeping to time is the cardinal rule of successful production. There will be no chance to develop a production strategy for a festival if the contractual and financial groundwork is not properly laid.  And if production and the artists are not in place, there won't be an event to market.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Steve Gordan, organiser of several music tours to South Africa, explains why the Cape Town jazz festival collapsed -- and how to put together a successful event</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Announced by Captour in 1994 as &quot;the biggest- ever jazz festival in Africa&quot;, the Cape Town International Jazz Festival, which collapsed last week, had already tasted controversy a year ago, when its promoters were accused of advertising artists who had not been contracted to perform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In February 1995, festival organiser Gerry Spencer, of Spencer-Miller Entertainment, was censured by the American management of jazz musician Harry Connick Junior, as well as by Duncan Gibbon, marketing manager of Gallo Records, which releases Connick's records in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accusing Spencer of breaking international conventions, Gibbon warned: &quot;Something like this can send the wrong signals to the outside world. South Africa has been thrust back into a more professional arena, and it is absolutely crucial that we learn the ropes very quickly.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not only was the advice unheeded but, tellingly, it was brushed aside by Spencer- Miller Entertainment, who claimed they had &quot;top-line jazz musicians queueing up in Japan, Australia, all over the place&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One year on, and it is clear that neither the festival's organisers, nor Captour, nor the prospective sponsors, learned anything from the incident. As late as a week before the scheduled commencement of the festival, artists were being advertised who had not been contracted to play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not only is this form of incautious promotion unfair to ticket-buyers, but it places artists on the horns of a dilemma: having been advertised, they will appear in poor light should they not participate. As Connick's manager wrote in a letter published in the Cape Times: &quot;Your use of Connick's name to promote your festival without his knowledge or permission results in severe harm to his reputation, since he will have to announce his 'cancellation' in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the prime drawcards of the festival was singer Randy Crawford.  But in late January this year, the festival organisers announced that she had &quot;withdrawn&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Crawford in fact reneged on a signed contract, it is puzzling why the organisers did not simply publish an explanatory statement from the artist .  Instead, there were obscure comments in the press from Spencer: &quot;They wanted us to guarantee her nine shows throughout South Africa, but we only wanted her for three shows in Cape Town.&quot; The number of shows requested during negotiations was surely irrelevant by the time the artist was advertised and contracted. Why confuse the public and the media?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paperwork does not seem to have been a strong point of the organisers, and this problem was not restricted to artist contracting. Reading between the lines in the wake of the collapse, it is clear that the requisite contracts and financing were not in place. The organisers first blamed the SABC, then pointed fingers at KLM and Captour. Verbal commitments may or may not have been made, but who would allow a festival to proceed when the payment of hundreds of thousands of rands had not been documented in writing?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In my mind, the responsibility rests on the shoulders of the festival's organisers, who were central to all the negotiations. But South Africans are so keen to stage events (and develop tourism) that Captour and the entertainment media went out and marketed the whole package prematurely. In future, let's check the contents first.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Disillusion is setting in among minority parties, as they believe the new Constitution will not provide sufficient checks and balances on the power of the future majority party government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, the African National Congress is increasingly irritated with minority groups, political and civic, who are demanding greater checks and balances in the final constitution than ANC negotiators think appropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Tuesday, the ANC was, for the first time since the elections, angry with the volkstaters. Less than two months before the finalisation date for the constitution, the Volkstaat Council has proposed a 10th &quot;Afrikaner&quot; province with exclusive powers, &quot;somewhere near Pretoria&quot;, in a bid to protect the culture of the Afrikaner people from future new South African governments.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC's anger was provoked as the notion of a 10th province had not been put on the table during bilaterals, and it came as a nasty surprise, said negotiators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the ANC's anger is larger than that, and is directed at more groups than just the volkstaters. As their grip on government gets firmer, and the party's authority grows, so does its irritation with minority parties who are demanding greater checks and balances get staked into the final constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senior ANC negotiator Pravin Gordhan said this week: &quot; We boldly say that minority parties are often concerned not with creating a democratic state, but rather checking the power of the majority party in the interest of the minority groups, which are often racially based. The debate is often masked in democratic terms, but it is frequently used to protect the rights of the privileged.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gordhan quoted disputes around the property clause in the bill of rights as proof. He believes the checks and balances are already written into the final constitution in draft form -- including the bill of rights, the parliamentary system, the provision for regular elections, the independent judiciary and three tiers of government -- indicating there are sufficient checks and balances to ensure democracy in future years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is disputed by the Freedom Front, the Democratic Party and, in a measure, the National Party, which is striving to negotiate into the final constitution a mechanism to give minority parties a greater say in decision-making in future government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NP had originally held out for a prolonged government of unity, precisely to provide a check to the majority party on executive level, but realising the ANC would never accept this, dropped the idea and is searching, at this late stage, for alternatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senior NP negotiator Roelf Meyer said this week: &quot;We must ensure a mechanism to allow opposition parties an input into the executive, possibly in a number of instances, for example, when declaring a state of emergency, or war or approving the budget.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Insiders say the NP is also trying to sell to the ANC the idea of a cultural commission which would have a powerful influence on government policy. And this commission would be used as a mechanism to protect minorities. (Meyer is permanently optimistic about the outcome of the bilaterals, and like a good umpire, always gives the ANC the benefit of the doubt.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The climate is conducive to compromise and for negotiating. There is a good spirit among parties ... we need to negotiate behind closed doors so we can allow politicians to change their minds and positions gracefully.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Face-saving on all sides is part of the negotiating game, but it is thought the NP is having to do more than any other party. Sources in the Constitutional Assembly say it is the DP, the noisiest of the opposition parties which, reluctant to compromise, digs in its heels the most, at times straining the bilateral mood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DP negotiator Ken Andrew takes this as a compliment. He believes that the ANC, at many levels, does not hold views conducive to allowing checks and balances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Nobody is taking the winner-take-all line, but the ANC does seem to support the view that the majority must take all the decisions, rather than the view that the majority has the majority say in government. These are two different things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Andrews says the latest drafts of the provincial powers make a mockery of the provincial governments acting as a check and balance against the power of the central government. Although the draft is confidential as it is the subject of continuing bilaterals and multilaterals next week, he said: &quot;The latest proposals on provincial power are as good as no protection from central government.&quot; The FF's Corne Mulder was similarly gloomy about the federal options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The proposals make the second house of Parliament a co-ordinating body which looks after the interest of the provinces, rather than a second chamber to check the power of the majority in the legislature.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The FF is engaging in continued bilaterals with the ANC to try and get a form of protection for Afrikaners written into the constitution, but has a gloomy view that its ideas, which have been on the table since April 1994, will not get a good reception, Mulder asserts: &quot;In the end, the constitution should be written for minorities, not majorities. If you want an inclusive constitution, it must give security to the minorities, because the majority has power in any case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mulder warns that the ANC ignores the minority issues at its own peril and that its focus on nation-building is fostering a false new patriotism which will not last.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His view is supported, to an extent, by political analyst Stephen Friedman, who is also cynical. &quot;It's natural for political parties to look after their own interest ... and this thing has boiled down to the ANC looking on minority participation in government as some sort of trick to bring apartheid through the back door. We will probably be reasonably happy with what comes out at that end -- I mean people will not be locked up at midnight as they were in the old days -- but future governments, through the constitution, will not reflect the preferences of voters who make up minorities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The extent to which parties have negotiated checks and balances on majority power since early January this year, will be revealed when the Constitutional Assembly produces its fourth working draft of the final constitution at the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One check and balance on executive power, so obvious it tends to get lost in the debate, is the constitution itself, which is the highest authority in the land, and is the citizen's protection against abuse by any branch of government. This much is supported by all political players and cannot be undermined.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The leading independent newspapers in Zimbabwe and Zambia -- which will both hold elections this year -- are under pressure to silence their criticism of government and ruling party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Should the newspapers, Zimbabwe's weekly Financial Gazette and Zambia's The Post, succumb to pressure, the governments of both countries will go virtually unchallenged in the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Financial Gazette, facing collapse under financial and government pressure, has been ordered by its publisher to cut &quot;political&quot; reporting. And two editors and a columnist of The Post were in hiding this week after the latest government action against the paper, this time under anachronistic legislation empowering Parliament to sentence dissenters for &quot;contempt&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For years, Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has slated the Financial Gazette as an opposition mouthpiece and &quot;pink press&quot;, a play on the colour of paper it uses. Despite its title -- and newsprint colour -- the Gazette has for years been Zimbabwe's foremost independent political paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But last week Elias Rusike, proprietor and chief executive of Modus, the company which owns the Financial Gazette, ruled that the paper should go light on politics, telling staffers to concentrate on policies, not personalities -- particularly that of the president. The popular &quot;Muckraker&quot; column was also scrapped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier in February the publisher suspended editor Trevor Ncube for a month after he published a Reuters story which claimed that Mugabe had instructed his pilots to &quot;jump the queue&quot;, ahead of South African President Nelson Mandela's plane, at Maseru Airport. Last week senior journalist Iden Wetherell, who is also a correspondent for the M&amp;G, resigned, citing proprietorial interference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wetherell wrote to Rusike that Ncube's suspension was undeserved, and implied that Rusike had bowed to the will of Mugabe, saying: &quot;Proprietors who bend to the will of politicians and party propagandists instead of defending their right to freedom of expression are unlikely to command respect at any level. Please convey that message to the other shareholders if they are proposing to remain in the newspaper business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the message is unlikely to have much effect. Modus sources say Rusike's determination to stand by his reporters' stories dwindled after he spent the weekend in police cells last May, locked up with Ncube after the Financial Gazette ran a lead story on Mugabe's &quot;secret&quot; second marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the People's Voice, the ruling Zanu-PF party tabloid, compared Financial Gazette reporters to modern-day Selous Scouts out to &quot;poison the minds of the people&quot;, Rusike called a board meeting where he changed the paper's political direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite that, Mugabe's government has stepped up its campaign against the paper. Though the Financial Gazette is profitable, the state Zimbank has refused to reschedule its debts. Two front-page stories in the state-owned Herald newspaper have predicted the collapse of the Financial Gazette by June. The articles are seen as warnings to the business community to refuse assistance to the paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rusike has seen his newspapers crumble in the face of government opposition. The Daily Gazette, which exposed corruption scandals, folded last year and the Sunday Gazette closed last month. The papers were widely read but advertisers shied away for fear of governmental disapproval. Rusike sought financial backers, but South Africa's Times Media Ltd, withdrew when the government blocked it from buying more than 25% of the publishing house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus the silencing of the Financial Gazette will leave Mugabe and his government virtually unchallenged since the remaining media are either state-owned or party-owned. Coverage of the presidential race amounts to slavish reporting of Mugabe's speeches, while only the most scanty coverage is granted to opposition candidates Bishop Abel Muzorewa and the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, The Post's editor-in-chief, Fred M'membe, managing editor Bright Mwape and columnist Lucy Sichone are in hiding to avoid arrest for being &quot;in contempt&quot; of Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paramilitary police visited the journalists' homes this week after they failed to appear last Friday before Parliament's Standing Orders Committee, which appears to have the power to impose sentences of up to 12 months, with or without hard labour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Media Institute of Southern Africa (Misa) said the journalists were &quot;maintaining a low profile&quot; as lawyers prepared papers challenging the action against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The contempt charges followed articles published by The Post critical of an attack in Parliament by Vice President Godfrey Miyanda on supreme court judges who had ruled earlier that sections of the Public Order Act, which requires politicians to get police permission for rallies, are unconstitutional. The Public Order Act has been used, among others, against former president Kenneth Kaunda, who is on the come-back trail and wants to contest elections against President Frederick Chiluba and his ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) later this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last Wednesday Parliament's speaker found the trio guilty of contempt when Miyanda complained about the articles, and referred the matter to the orders committee for sentencing under the National Assembly Powers and Privileges Act, which Misa says originated in colonial times to stop blacks from contesting the utterances of MPs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Post said last Friday it had been informed that the committee had already decided on a four-month sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> M'membe, Mwape and co-editor Matsautso Phiri are already facing charges of illegally possessing copies of their own newspaper (an edition that had been banned) and under the Official Secrets Act (after The Post revealed what it said was the authorities' secret plan to push through the country's disputed new Constitution).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nzo was already in Angola on the initial leg of his trip when Moroccan diplomats raised objections -- about his itinerary and his intentions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nzo was to have gone from Luanda directly to the Moroccan capital of Rabat, ostensibly for bilateral discussions, and from there to Algeria where he intended meeting the leaders of Polisario, the movement which claims Moroccan-occupied Western Sahara as its own in the name of the Saharawi Repubic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moroccan sensitivities were sparked by reports in South Africa indicating that Nzo wanted to help mediate in the unresolved dispute over the region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moroccan concerns were compounded by the meetings that the South African foreign mission in Rabat was setting up for Nzo &quot;and the nature of the discussions&quot;, foreign affairs director-general Rusty Evans confirmed this week. &quot;They queried whether there was not more to the context of his visit than met the eye.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nor were they prepared to have Nzo travel directly from Rabat to Algeria for meetings with the Polisario leadership, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The arrangements being made in Rabat -- against the background of reports here -- caused the Moroccans to raise directly with (Nzo) in Angola the question of clarity of his agenda in Rabat. It seemed to the Moroccans that he wanted to get involved in talks,&quot; Evans said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Certainly, the understanding of the ANC's Department of International Affairs and its Youth League - which has fraternal links with Polisario's youth wing -- was that the visit would involve &quot;an even-handed reaching out to both sides&quot;, if not actual mediation, said ANCYL international affairs representative Neville Naidoo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC MP Blade Nzimande, who chairs the party's national executive sub-committee on international affairs, said: &quot;That was the whole aim of the trip -- to discuss the Western Sahara issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nzo spent an extra day in Luanda. During this time, Mandela telephoned the king of Morocco to reassure him of Nzo's intentions, Evans confirmed, and Nzo's itinerary was re-worked to make Rabat the last stop and enabling him to return on schedule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;South Africa has an important bilateral relationship with Morocco and you have to take care of it. The Western Sahara-Polisario issue has a direct bearing on it because of Moroccan sensitivities and this has to be managed,&quot; said Evans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While in Rabat, Nzo signed an agreement establishing a Joint Commission of Co-operation between South Africa and the Kingdom of Morocco to ease co-operation in fields of a bilateral nature, such as trade and transport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Tindouf he spent time with Polisario leaders. An old ally of the ANC's, Polisario has been agitating for South Africa to honour a June 1995 commitment by Mandela to extend diplomatic recognition to the Saharawi Republic. Moroccan diplomatic efforts have focused on preventing this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government's official position is to hold off, pending the outcome of a United Nations-sponsored referendum, but is also under internal political pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Briefing members of parliament's foreign affairs portfolio committee recently, Moroccan ambassador Mohammed Said Benryane urged South Africa not to &quot;prejudge&quot; the outcome of the UN referendum. Morocco occupies two-thirds of the mineral-rich Western Sahara, claiming it as part of a greater Morocco, even though the old colonial power, Spain, accepted the independence of Western Sahara in 1975. Morocco claims Polisario is waging a struggle for secession, rather than self-determination, and its relations with Algeria are coloured by the support that country gives to Polisario.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A UN security council resolution extended the UN organisers' mandate to May 31, in an effort to get the troubled process back on track.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Last week's article by Louise Flanagan on Military Intelligence attempts to recruit future Minister of Defence Joe Modise in the early 1990s has provoked a furious row. Here, Deputy Defence Minister Ronnie Kasrils responds -- as does the reporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Having distinguished itself as a bastion of the free press, and for many years under siege by the apartheid regime, will the Mail &amp; Guardian continue to be a vigilant gatekeeper for the truth? Recent form calls this into question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Louise Flanagan's article &quot;How Military Intelligence tried to recruit Modise&quot; (February 23 to 29 1996) is an example of sloppy journalism and is a discredit to your paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not only does she give undue prominence to the extremely questionable views of a disgraced member of a discredited intelligence section of the old South African Defence Force, but she also does nothing to challenge the substance of those allegations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, she allows the specious and potentially libelous allegations, emanating from a Military Intelligence (MI) officer's memorandum (drafted by Commandant Anton Nieuwoudt) in September 1992 to pass as if they amounted to fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, her statement that Nieuwoudt's &quot;three-page memo discusses the conflict within the ANC between the militants, headed by Chris Hani, and the moderates, headed by Modise&quot;, blithely accepts there was &quot;conflict&quot; within the ANC between &quot;militants&quot; and &quot;moderates&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Terms such as &quot;militants&quot; and &quot;moderates&quot; falsely seek to polarise and negatively stereotype the debates within the ANC, which have always been commendably civil and disciplined, and entirely normal to a popular organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This also applies to her statement that &quot;MI tried to recruit Modise nearly two years before the 1994 elections, relying on the belief that Modise was willing to smash the ANC-South African Communist Party alliance in order to secure his own position under a future government&quot;. Nowhere does she challenge the basis of the &quot;belief&quot;, and neither does she question the nefarious allegation that Modise &quot;was willing to smash the ANC-SACP alliance in order to secure his own position under a future government&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The record is clear. Modise has no prejudice against communists. On the contrary, he appointed the late Joe Slovo as his deputy in 1976, and in 1983 as chief of staff; Chris Hani as commissar in 1983, and as Slovo's successor in 1986 when Slovo resigned to take up his post as general secretary of the SACP; and myself as MI chief in 1983.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is the same man who chose an alleged member of the so-called &quot;SACP faction&quot; as his deputy minister of defence in June 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accusations of a split between the ANC and SACP had long been the stock-in-trade of apartheid's &quot;divide and rule&quot; rumour mongers, and again the enduring solidarity of the liberation alliance hoists that lie on its own petard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, and without flagging the reader's attention to the insidiousness of the aspersions in the memo, Flanagan goes on to write that Nieuwoudt noted that the so-called &quot;moderates&quot;, allegedly headed by Modise, &quot;were targeted because they could be used against Hani&quot;, and that &quot;they were regarded as open to recruitment due to their own self-interest&quot;. She far too uncritically accepts the smear that &quot;they could be used against Hani&quot;, and appears to compound it by adding, without question, that they were allegedly &quot;open to recruitment due to their own self-interest&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These apparent slurs are allowed to develop further in her statement: &quot;Referring back to the period just after the memo was written, he (Nieuwoudt) commented that MI already knew then which of their sources among the MK members would be appointed as generals, brigadiers and lieutenant-colonels in the new military.&quot; This claim is simply preposterous, and easily verifiable as such, since MK at the time of that memo (September 1992) had no ranks. MK only began its bilateral negotiations with the SADF in 1993 and only began the process of ranking its members in early 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The character of distinguished MK commanders is possibly further impugned by her bald statement that: &quot;Although there is no indication whether any of the group approached were indeed recruited, at least two now hold senior positions. Modise is the minister of defence and in June 1994 Lambert Moloi (one of the so- called 'Modise moderates') was promoted to major-general and made chief of the Service Brigade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The use of the word &quot;although&quot; implies that in spite of the fact that there is absolutely no evidence to support the claim that any senior MK members were actually &quot;approached&quot; or &quot;were indeed recruited&quot;, her subsequent statement that &quot;at least two now hold senior positions&quot; could be easily construed as casting doubt over the integrity of the minister and Moloi, not to mention the other &quot;Modise moderates&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The effect of Flanagan's reasoning is perverse. By conflating an alleged split in the ranks of MK with Nieuwoudt's devious scheme to compromise the minister, she appears to pin the blame for the conspiracy on one of its intended targets: Joe Modise. Instead of attacking the conspirators, Flanagan attacks their target. This is, at best, muddle-headed and, at worst, outrageous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It therefore ill behoves the M&amp;G, with its fine record of fighting for the truth, to amplify the lies and smears of the apartheid regime by such seemingly ill-judged and uncritical reporting of a document that is so clearly self-serving on the part of Nieuwoudt, who, at that stage of his career, was desperate to impress his superiors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Flanagan to state that Modise denied he had ever attended such a meeting, &quot;but declined to answer any further questions&quot; is a travesty of the truth and, as such, creates the false impression that he was being evasive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The truth is that he answered the M&amp;G as follows: &quot;I want to state clearly that I never attended a meeting that you referred to in your questions. It follows from that, that I have no information relating to the other questions you have raised.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is a sad but true reflection that a journalist who identifies uncritically with a dubious source may compromise the objectivity of his or her reporting, and may thereby run the attendant risk of losing credibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this circumstance, Flanagan has lost credibility with the ANC which, in its press statement in defence of Modise, has stated: &quot;It is strange also that the M&amp;G would have chosen to overlook the close personal relationship between the author of the article, Louise Flanagan, and the source of the (Nieuwoudt) documents, Colonel Gerrie Hugo (former chief of MI in the Ciskei, who was charged with stealing covert funds and pleaded guilty), and the dispute Hugo has been having with the South African National Defence Force and the Ministry of Defence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A responsible newspaper must exercise reasonable editorial judgment in terms of its journalists' reports. My view is the M&amp;G failed in its responsibility in this respect. My earnest hope is the M&amp;G will maintain the integrity it built up during the anti-apartheid period and continue to be worthy of our respect. For me that is the challenge facing your paper in our new democratic era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Louise Flanagan replies:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The article was not &quot;giving prominence to the extremely questionable views of a disgraced member of a discredited intelligence section of the old SADF&quot;. It was based on court papers and illustrated the MI campaigns which were being run against the ANC in the run-up to the elections. On the basis of these papers, the SADF settled the claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sections that were used from the documents were clearly indicated as such and were not the reporter's personal opinion. Kasrils should rather direct his criticisms towards the senior officers of the old SADF who drafted the documents and ran the campaign. Instead, in his response, Kasrils has relied on a method frequently used by MI: if you don't like the message, attack the messenger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I find it hard to believe Kasrils misread this article so badly that he construed it as support for MI's dirty tricks campaigns. I have written several articles trying to track down the elusive Steyn Commission report and calling for it to be made public. This government has declined to release it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why does the present government wish to protect officers from the old SADF who were involved in illegal campaigns against legal political organisations in the run-up to the elections?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Regarding the ANC's statement: The military, the ANC, the M&amp;G and the newspaper which employs me full-time (Daily Dispatch) are all fully aware of the relationship between Hugo and me, as there has been no attempt to hide this. As a result of this relationship I have not covered Hugo's recent court case (at my own request). The stories resulting from the Nieuwoudt court documents were published the day after Hugo's case was finalised and thus could not have had any bearing on that matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Modise's terse response to our question arrived many hours after deadline. In the hurry to include it, it was accidentally said that he had declined to answer further questions, rather than he had no information relating to these questions. The difference may be obscure to readers, but we apologise to him for the change in meaning. -- The Editor</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - It was a casual weekend -- Hernus Kriel was wearing baggy track suit pants, Sheila Camerer a light pink slack suit, John Mavuso designer moccasins and FW de Klerk a checked shirt. But behind the informality and bonhomie in Hermanus, the Nats were in deadly earnest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Tell me,&quot; said De Klerk, leaning in earnest over crayfish and Dewetshof Chardonnay on Saturday night, &quot;now that you have had this weekend, would you have written any differently, now that you understand?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Journalists at his table found themselves in a difficult position. There is no such thing as a free lunch, they say, nor a free candle-lit dinner in Hermanus's swishest restaurant.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The weekend was useful: policy positions were re-articulated, De Klerk's vision was explained again, and it was possible to mingle with National Party politicians, many of them former Cabinet ministers of the apartheid government, and talk loosely about the party's future. But there was nothing new -- no face-lift to write about, nothing to change the perspective that the Nats are in trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An all-day briefing even provided an opportunity for open derision. When Minister of Tourism Dawie de Villiers used his time on Saturday afternoon to speak in detail about Hermanus's chief tourist attraction, whales, a journalist piped up that his hotel was full of frustrated tourists who had not been able to spot whales, and perhaps the Nats should send their lost black Cabinet minister, Abe Williams, floating down the coast on his back, blowing bubbles, to do his bit for tourism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the face of uproarious laughter, De Villiers and the other party members on the panel squirmed in embarrassment. It was not the only mocking comment. The media are learning to be openly irreverent about the NP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And it is this tide of irreverence that the Nats are trying to turn back, with a strategy that swings from defence to seduction and then back to defence. They see the media as gatekeepers to a new black electorate, which they have to seduce in order to survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That weekend the Nats invested in the future and threw money at the media to woo them. It was expertly organised, including two nights at Hermanus hotels with views of the sea, a welcoming party and open bar on Friday night, a sea-food dinner, a personalised zip-up faux leather folder for all journalists, and as an &quot;afdenking geskenkie,&quot; a bottle of red wine, with an NP label plastered on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While journalists clearly enjoyed themselves, these offerings did not sway minds. A black journalist, who preferred not to be named, said: &quot;During dinner, I was watching some of the Nats listen to some SABC colleagues' homeland anecdotes. The MPs avoided eye contact with the storyteller and maintained eye contact among themselves in a patronising way that said: 'Jislaaik, these black ouens are really good when it comes to telling stories.' About the content of the tales, there seemed to be little of the clearly required embarrassment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The weekend was something of a 'black box' exercise: it provided really good background on why Nats are heading for the rocks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The worst thing De Klerk did, it appears, was boast about his new black Cabinet minister. In defence of his attitude towards affirmative action, he pointed to Mavuso and said: &quot;Mavuso is a black man ... but he is a competent black.&quot; Mavuso, though, was not given the floor once to talk about his history, about his attitudes to the NP, or to defend himself against criticism that he is a political party-hopping hack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SABC journalist Manelisi Dubase said De Klerk's statement was insulting to the black community: &quot;It goes down to saying that blacks are generally incompetent.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - There was a time when the African National Congress Youth League's leaders roared and the security establishment's grip automatically tightened on its rifle butts. This was the 1980s -- when the ANCYL was one of the most militant underground organisations in the country and its campaigns were guaranteed to strike a chord with thousands of angry young people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This week, hundreds of &quot;young lions&quot; gathered again at the Durban Exhibition Centre for the ANCYL's 19th national conference. Their roaring muted, they had come to chart a new and far less militant path for the organisation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANCYL deputy president Bheki Nkosi said on the eve of the conference that his members were still militant, but the organisation's leadership had to redirect them. &quot;They are impatient with the slow pace of change, and want militant action to speed it up. But we want them to become soldiers of democracy, to utilise their militancy to deepen democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At the same time, we want to infuse dynamism in the ANC and ensure that new and different ideas permeate the organisation. It would be folly for us to think that the bulk of our membership is satisfied with the pace of transformation. We have to ensure their message reaches the ANC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This task will not be easy. The ANCYL is weak, its leadership creamed off two years ago to serve in the government and civil service, its resources limited and its active membership down to about 150 000 nationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are also two strains of thought in the organisation at present: one advocates that the ANCYL remain politically correct and support the ANC government wholeheartedly, and another that it support the government critically and militantly challenge it to speed up the pace of transformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;One group thinks the government is on the right track and the ANCYL should play a constructive role. They say we should examine what we are doing to ensure our concerns get on to the government's agenda,&quot; said Parks Mankahlana, one of the ANCYL executive members &quot;creamed off&quot; to serve on the president's staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Then other members believe if the youth league gets involved in taking decisions with the government, it will eventually end up in the same position as the National Party, because the government takes decisions in a way which accommodates everybody. There would be no space for militant and radical decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For instance, when the youth league pushed for the scrapping of the Springbok logo, the ANC was mad at us. The ANC said it was just a dumb animal and its retention would convey a message of reconciliation. It's a small thing, but the Springbok became a break between the youth league and the ANC.  Some say it was the breaking point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mankahlana said a common complaint among some members of the ANCYL is that election promises could have been delivered faster if the government were not constantly concerned with allaying white fears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But both schools of thought are supported equally in the ANCYL, he said.  The conference would probably do its best to adopt an approach bridging both positions, while opening space for the league to push its positions with its parent body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Since the release of the ANC's leadership and the return of its exiles, the leadership of the organisation shifted from the young lions to the old guard. The youth took a back seat. Today the national leadership of the ANC is characterised by old men whose traditions and conventions are deeply entrenched,&quot; Mankahlana said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At the same time South Africa has become just another ordinary democratic society. People's concerns have moved away from political issues and we have to build the ANCYL around those issues, changing its focus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mankahlana said surveys had shown that the primary concerns of young people are education and jobs. Other concerns are social issues like crime, drug abuse and sexually transmitted diseases. The ANCYL would have to devise programmes to mobilise the youth around those issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nkosi said the conference would also have to devise ways of reviving the league's structures, reactivating branches and giving them a programme of action by which to recruit other young people. A political education campaign would have to be started soon, to train new cadres to fill the leadership vacuum in the ANCYL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alliances would be forged with other organisations to build a broad youth movement. With youth constituting more than half South Africa's population, they will be a significant voting bloc in the 1999 elections and will pose a major destabilisation threat if they grow more disenchanted with the government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - History will also be in the dock when the multiple murder trial of former defence minister Magnus Malan and 19 other security force officers gets under way next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As it starts under the grey stone pillars of Durban's Supreme Court on Monday morning, the legal floodlights will turn on to the murky genesis of the &quot;third force&quot; and how the security forces helped create the myth of &quot;black-on-black&quot; political violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A new charge added to the indictment this week suggests a conspiracy far beyond the gruesome 1987 murder of 13 innocent civilians in KwaMakhutha with which they were originally charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The alternative count of conspiracy &quot;to wrongfully and intentionally kill members of the ANC, UDF (United Democratic Front) and related organisations&quot; broadens the initial charges of murder, attempted murder and conspiracy to murder to the murder of UDF activist Victor Ntuli.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It places back-room schemes of the shadowy State Security Council squarely on the centre stage of the carnage which has by now claimed at least 20 000 lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The foul winds of the &quot;ethnic&quot; brew the security forces allegedly stirred still blow in the province more than a decade after Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi allegedly detailed his security &quot;requirements&quot; to then Military Intelligence head Tienie Groenewald.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, as the men who allegedly responded to that request for security stand trial in a courtroom that will probably be packed with many of the &quot;terrorists&quot; they once targeted, the opportunity is there for them to finally clear the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ironically, the trial is likely to increase tensions in the province as political parties use it to score propoganda points in advance of the local government elections due in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IFP will use the trial to mobilise its mainly rural constituents again in a campaign that paints the party as the victim of an ANC conspiracy.  The ANC will use it to portray the IFP and the National Party as the aggressors of war -- vital in its bid to win over Indian and white voters in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With a court transcript that promises to read like a who's who of apartheid state-sponsored violence, the world will be watching the proceedings. Even ordinary civilians may find themselves under the glare of the public spotlight as the witnesses -- ranging from alleged co-conspirators to others listed as being from &quot;Autopage cellular&quot; and &quot;Radiospoor&quot; -- take the stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unfortunately, it will be standing room only outside the court, with 65 spectators -- including 20 journalists -- allowed into the public gallery.  Even the seven defence teams will have a tight squeeze after extra space was taken up to expand the dock for the 20 accused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Watching the proceedings in-tensely will be the Investigation Task Unit (ITU), which faces its first crucial test more than a year after it began probing KwaZulu-Natal hit squads. Mired in unwanted political controversy throughout its existence, the team -- led by its indomitable director, Frank Dutton -- has achieved what previous commissions could only dream of: getting to the belly of the proverbial beast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the unit's allegations are validated, it will be a milestone in South Africa's legal history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Dutton -- whose successes in solving the Trust Feeds massacre, which sent killer policeman Brian Mitchell and others to prison, and on the Goldstone Commission placed him under the glare of public ridicule years ago -- a conviction will be a personal vindication for the course he has chosen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The short walk to the Durban Supreme Court down Salmon Grove's single block in the old section of Durban adjacent to the bay is a stark contrast to the long road Dutton and his team have travelled to get there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From the constant condemnation of the IFP to the indignant outcry of the right wing when Malan and others were arrested, the ITU has battled on, gradually piecing together one of the most astonishing chapters of South Africa's sordid past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monday morning will be the beginning of the end of that chapter. The trial will feature a battle of legal giants as the prosecution advocate, KwaZulu-Natal Attorney General Tim McNally, squares off against the chief defence advocate, former Witwatersrand attorney general Klaus von Lieres, and six other advocates. It is set down for three months, but could take more than a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The case will cost the taxpayer millions of rands as the Defence Ministry has said it will pay the costs of former and serving members who are on trial. It is still unclear who will foot the bill for the airfares and accommodation for the accused, most of whom live outside KwaZulu-Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mail &amp; Guardian disclosed last November that key witness, Major JP Opperman, has been under witness protection in Europe with his family. He will have to be flown in for the trial. Opperman will tell the court that he was at the heart of Operation Marion, the covert state plan to train a paramilitary unit for the IFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He will be giving evidence against his former defence force bosses, and may say he decided to own up after reading a press interview with former political commissar for Inkatha's paramilitary forces, Daluxolo Luthuli. At the time, Luthuli told a reporter from the M&amp;G that he had personally been in charge of a 300-strong hit squad which operated out of Ulundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Andre Cloete, another former permanent force member, will also give evidence against his former leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their testimony, together with that of Luthuli and dozens of other witnesses, as well as stacks of documentation seized from Military Intelligence, is expected to put pressure on a number of other politicians also believed to have facilitated the birth of the &quot;third force&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mangosuthu Buthelezi's name -- which featured in the original indictment and again in this week's supplementary indictment -- will resonate throughout the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deputy President FW de Klerk, who has announced his intention to make submissions to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on behalf of the NP, will also have his ears glued to the testimony in anticipation of his submission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those in the dock, however, will have little recourse to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission at this stage. While they could ask for a stay of proceedings to apply for amnesty, McNally, the judge and the Amnesty Committee will have to agree to hand the case over to the commission -- and even then, the nature of the alleged crimes may preclude amnesty.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - President Nelson Mandela has been personally lobbying political parties for support on new legislation to crack down on the causes of violence in Kwazulu-Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was confirmed by the president's spokesman Parks Mankahlana, who said the president was eager to close the loopholes in certain laws which made it possible to carry dangerous weapons in potentially explosive situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This follows three weeks after Mandela, in his speech at the opening of Parliament, mourned the extent of the violence in KwaZulu-Natal, and said that measures would be introduced to ban the carrying of dangerous weapons during public demonstrations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mankahlana said the talks, held separately with each political party in Parliament, were in anticipation of draft legislation which would come from the justice and safety and security departments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the legislation would not introduce a direct ban on all weapons, but merely try to control the carrying of them under certain circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mankahlana said Mandela had been meeting IFP leader Dr Mangosuthu Buthelezi continuously to discuss the violence in Kwazulu-Natal, but would not say whether Buthelezi had given Mandela support for the proposed new legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The carrying of dangerous and cultural weapons has been a bone of contention between political parties since the negotiations over the transition from apartheid rule to democracy. The Inkatha Freedom Party could not be contacted for comment by the time of going to press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the Democratic Party has given its unequivocal support to the measures, on the condition that new laws are implemented in an unpartisan way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DP leader Tony Leon said Mandela had promised that the measures would not be used as a &quot;club with which to beat Inkatha on the head&quot;. Leon said Mandela had promised that ANC members who had transgressed the law would also be brought to book.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources in the Freedom Front said General Constand Viljoen was reserving his position on the proposals at this stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Party said they had given their support to Mandela on the principle of the legislation and would discuss the details in Cabinet.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - English lawyer Richard Meeran arrived in South Africa this week to prepare a multi-million-rand lawsuit in the British courts against Thor Chemicals for damages suffered by 20 workers, exposed to high levels of mercury toxins, at the multinational's subsidiary in KwaZulu-Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The case is a landmark one because it is poised to help ensure that British companies operating in South Africa and other developing countries are forced to apply the same strict health and safety standards, which apply in their home country, to subsidiary operations in the Third World.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opportunity to sue in British courts arose when the House of Lords, the highest court of appeal in England, this month refused to entertain an appeal by Thor for the litigation to be heard in South Africa where the health and safety legislation is less advanced than in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meeran originally sued the parent company in mid-1994 on behalf of three workers whose health was seriously damaged after being exposed to high levels of mercury at a Thor plant in Cato Ridge that was importing toxic waste from the United States and other countries, which refused to process the material because of its dangers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two of the workers, Peter Cele and Engelbert Ngcobo, died while the third victim, Albert Dlamini, is permanently disabled at the age of 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was this case Thor appealed against, arguing South African courts were the most appropriate forum for it to be heard. The House of Lords's rejection of that appeal this month cleared the way for South African victims of Thor to litigate in England.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The milestone decision encouraged Meeran to come to South Africa and prepare a case for another 17 workers whose health was seriously impaired, allegedly by chronic exposure to mercury toxins at the Cato Ridge plant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is currently collecting information to quantify the extent of the claims these workers will bring against the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An official commission of inquiry has been appointed by President Nelson Mandela to probe why the previous government allowed Thor to bring such dangerous waste into the country -- and the company has since been forced to shut down its mercury recycling plant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meeran believes civil claims lodged in England by the victims of British subsidiaries will help force multinationals operating in the Third World to abide by the same health and safety standards that apply in their home country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has gathered evidence which shows Thor moved part of its British plant to South Africa in the 1980s after that country's health and safety executive, which monitors health standards in local firms, expressed concern about the high levels of mercury in blood and urine of workers in England.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meeran argues the parent company should bear major responsibility for the damage caused to its South African employees because Thor management in England played a strong role in the design of the Cato Ridge factory and moved some of the British plant and its personnel to KwaZulu-Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lawyer has not completed an assessment of the damage caused to the South African workers through loss of income, pain and suffering but estimates their claim will come to a total of $1-million. The British company has a turnover of about $50-million a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thor management in South Africa argues the health of the first three workers was caused by acute exposure to mercury from an act of sabotage rather than bad company practice at the Cato Ridge plant -- a claim which Meeran says was refuted by Dr Lazlo Magos, an internationally-renowned toxicologist, who examined the victims' medical and work records in preparation for the case and found they suffered chronic exposure over an extended period of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The company also refuses to accept the health of the other 17 workers is in any way related to mercury exposure.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York - Letter to His Excellency Jerry John Rawlings, President of the Republic of Ghana, The Castle, P. O. Box 1627, Accra, GHANA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Your Excellency, The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) strongly protests the April 17 detention of Eben Quarcoo, editor of the weekly &quot;The Free Press,&quot; and the newspaper's publisher, Tommy Thompson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On April 17, Quarcoo and Thompson were summoned by the police to answer accusations of violating Section 185 of the 1960 Criminal Code, &quot;publishing falsehoods with the intent of injuring the reputation of the State.&quot; They were detained for five hours, interrogated, then released on an exorbitant 10 million cedis (US$ 6,700) bail each. They were never charged.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The accusation against the pair arose from an April 10 front-page article in &quot;The Free Press&quot; that was culled from an article in the March 14-27 issue of the New York-based, bi-weekly newspaper, the &quot;African Observer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In reference to outstanding criminal libel charges that Thompson and Quarcoo currently face in Ghana's Supreme Court, &quot;The Free Press&quot; prefaced the article with the disclaimer: &quot;We are publishing (this) story without malice, contempt or prejudice to let Ghanaians know what they are saying about their president elsewhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a nonpartisan group of journalists committed to the defense of its colleagues' rights worldwide, CPJ contends that this latest incident of harassment against &quot;The Free Press,&quot; the third in two years, is excessive and misdirected. Having written to Your Excellency earlier this year, we reemphasize our call for an end to the harassment of Ghanaian independent journalists; the elimination of pernicious, anti-press laws, such as Section 185 and criminal libel; and the creation of an environment in which Ghanaian journalists may do their jobs freely and safely. These rights are guaranteed by Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, both to which, we again respectfully remind Your Excellency, Ghana is a signatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank you for your attention. We welcome your comments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London - There were indications last month that the National Islamic Front (NIF) war machine in Southern Sudan was grinding to a halt. A renewed offensive by the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) has demoralised the regime's forces. There are rumours of mutiny among the regime's soldiers in the South, surviving on subsistence rations and unpaid for many months. The threat of a war front opening up in Eastern Sudan has posed the regime military problems it could do without. The regime's response has been to play at making cease-fires with Riek Machar's Southern Sudan Independence Movement (SSIM) and to pursue once more the peace initiative of the Intergovernmental Authority for Drought and Development (IGADD). Meanwhile there is the very real threat of comprehensive sanctions likely to be imposed by the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New Front on the Blue Nile</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On 17 March the SPLA announced that it had reopened a war front in the Blue Nile province by capturing the little known but strategically important garrison post of Khor Yabus. The post lies twenty-five miles to the south of Kurmuk, a town which was first captured by the SPLA in 1987, causing blind panic in Khartoum.  The town is close to the Rosieres Dam at Damazin, which supplies the electricity to the national capital. The threat in 1987 was considered serious enough for the government of the day to devote all its resources to repelling the invasion of the North by the SPLA.  That government was in a considerably better position, economically and politically, than the NIF regime is today. With the capture of Khor Yabus and the destruction of an entire battalion there, the SPLA has sent a serious warning to Khartoum. At the time of going to press, the SPLA has just been reported to have captured two more garrison towns in Upper Nile province, Pachalla and Maban Fashala in Southeastern Upper Nile; and Shalifil in the Blue Nile Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SPLA operations in Southern Blue Nile are under the overall command of a local man, Commander Malik Agar. He is also the SPLA's administrative governor for the area. His tactics are based upon his detailed personal knowledge of the local terrain. The field command of the SPLA forces is being managed by Commander John Kong Nyuon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By opening up the front in Southern Blue Nile the SPLA has demonstrated its control of the border areas in Southern Sudan and its ability to return to areas that it had to evacuate in 1991 following the aftermath of the fall of the Mengistu regime in Ethiopia and schism within the movement at Nasir in August of that year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rumours of Mutiny</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even before the latest SPLA offensive began, rumours abounded that there was widespread discontent within the regime's army in the South. The effects of the regime's policies, preferring to use the Popular Defence Forces (PDF) rather than the regular army, and the lack of clear objectives in the war, have sapped soldiers' morale. Reports of mutinies were given credence when the army chief of staff in Khartoum visited some units in the South. A battalion based at Liria, on the road between Juba and Torit, was reported to have disobeyed orders to engage the SPLA during February. When allocated ammunition, they fired it into the air and refused to move out. They demanded a personal meeting with the chief of staff, which is why he made the journey South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the mutinying troops' demands is to be transferred back to the North. They had been assured that their tour of duty in the South would only last for six months, yet it has gone on much longer--four and a half years to be exact! Another of their demands is the payment of their salaries which they have not had for five months. They have no money with which to supplement their subsistence rations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chief of staff promised that all their demands would be dealt with following his return to Khartoum. Recognising that these were words rather than actions, the troops informed him that they would not be carrying out any duties until their demands had been fulfilled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other rumours emerging from the South have spoken of army units seriously considering switching allegiance and of joining forces with the SPLA. The garrison at Yirol, in Bahr El Ghazal, under its commander Lieutenant Colonel El Sheikh Mahmoud Abushara, is reported to have already turned itself over to the SPLA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cease-fire with Machar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an apparent attempt to reduce its commitments in the South, and to encourage the SPLA to halt its offensive, the regime and Riek Machar's Southern Sudan Independence Movement (SSIM) both unilaterally declared cease-fires. Not surprisingly, these announcements for cease-fires were not taken too seriously by observers because it is well known that there has never been any serious fighting between Machar's forces and those of the regime. In 1992, Machar claimed to have attacked Malakal, but that turned out to be the work of a Nuer spiritual leader, Wurnyang. When the regime's forces moved in 1994 to recapture Machar's headquarters at Nasir, the town was taken without any battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To all intents and purposes, it seemed that the regime's intention was to goad the SPLA into agreeing to a cease-fire. Previously, the SPLA has always gone along with these unilateral temporary cease-fires because to do otherwise would have been to appear to be against a peaceful settlement of the conflict. However, that was at a time when the international community took the regime's protestations of peace at face value. That is no longer the case. The regime has been condemned internationally and its delaying tactics are now well known.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Returning to IGADD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rapprochement with Mr Machar was one side of a twin policy pursued by the Khartoum regime. The other involved the reactivation of the IGADD peace process some two years after the regime walked out on it. Visiting Nigeria and Kenya, Lieutenant General Omer El Behir declared that he wanted peace in Sudan. He informed Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi that he wanted to participate in the IGADD peace process, without conditions, on the basis of the six principles document that the organization had produced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On 21 March, whilst attending the regular meeting of the IGADD heads of state in Nairobi, El Beshir gave the impression that the whole meeting had been arranged to discuss the Sudanese peace process. He also gave the impression that the summit was designed to reconcile him with his political neighbours in the IGADD organisation. Unfortunately for him, nothing is ever quite what it seems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not For Peace</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting had nothing to do with the peace process, although peace for the region might have been briefly discussed during the meeting. The meeting was essentially an organisational one which discussed all of IGADD's affairs.  It would be too simplistic to believe that a simple hand shake between El Beshir and the Ugandan and Eritrean leaders could undo the enmity and mistrust which exists between the countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On a final footnote to the above events, it has been speculated that the regime is considering handing over Upper Nile province to Riek Machar and removing its own army units from the province. Mr Machar would then be given support to pursue his conflict with the SPLA. The reasoning behind such a move would be the regime's ability to relocate the troops from Upper Nile to the expected war front in Eastern Sudan. Just how much truth there is in this story remains to be seen; but Mr Machar and three of his lieutenants were sighted in Khartoum recently.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Zambian Parliament this afternoon resumed sittings with little evidence of increased security activity on the National Assembly grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For now the focus of attention was on Mulungushi International Conference Centre, next door, where secretaries of major political parties were still meeting behind tightly closed doors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These officials are trying to come up with an acceptable agenda on topics which can be discussed by leaders of all political parties now aspiring to take up reigns of government after the coming presidential and parliamentary elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The officials, who convened at about 9:30 hours, were still locked up in their meeting at 15:00 hours with information variously coming out to the press that a final communique on deliberations will be released to media people by about 15:30 hours or an hour later.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the National Assembly business was expected to be light on this first day but there was no doubt that all three political parties represented in the house are primed to fight to the bitter end for their diverse positions as regards the most burning question - which is the adoption of the draft Mwanakatwe Republican Constitution which should turn into law before the present sitting is out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia's foremost opposition political party, UNIP, is campaigning vigorously for the adoption of the new constitution by a 'constituent assembly' in the hope that this kind of assembly will push aside the clause which restricts the Zambian Presidency only to citizens whose parents were also Zambians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For now the clause is seen as a major turnstile in the political path of former State President Kenneth Kaunda whose parents came from Malawi and who himself, for reasons which he has not explained, failed to take up Zambian citizenship until 1970 when his one time childhood and later bitter political foe, Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe, begun to disclose to the nation at large that in fact the President was still a Malawian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Kaunda has himself repeatedly informed the nation that he is a Zambian and that he intends to stand, 'with or without the new draft constitution.' The Government has politely reminded him that laws are for obeying and those who choose to break them, knowingly or otherwise, are subject to punishment irrespective of their status in society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tied to the issue of the new constitution is the holding of next Presidential and Parliamentary elections which some sections of the community would like to see held under the old constitution, 'to humour the oldman' and restore harmony in the land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But government has made its position clear - and this is that the new constitution will have to be adopted by parliament under this session pointing out that when the clause was petitioned for by those who submitted at the sittings of the Mwanakatwe Constitutional Review Commission, Dr Kaunda was in self imposed retirement and totally out of the picture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That the 'spike' is hurting him now, is never intentional. This position is accepted by government supporters who are quick to point out that in his time Dr Kaunda brooked no challenge and that was why his party's constitution was literally altered overnight so as to bar the late veteran politicians Harry Mwaanga Nkumbula and Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe and Chiluwe who is now walking the streets of Lusaka a poor and broken man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Sunday when Dr Kaunda was asked by a Zambia National Broadcasting Corportaion Television reporter why he had seen it necessary to bar Kapwepwe, Nkumbula and Chiluwe from challenging him, his only responce was that it had not been done by him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I never barred anybody from contesting. Ask my colleague (Mainza) Chona, he will tell you more what happened,&quot; he said not looking into the camera. Mr Chona is the man seen by most Zambians as the 'fall guy' in the drama which brought in one party rule and its excesses and who when the chips were down was being singled out for vicious condemnation by detractors of the system. He has not complained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That there is a lot of lively debate ahead of the session which started today is never in doubt. Most people, however, are sure what will go on in parliament will be dictated by the political 'indaba' now convened at Mulungushi Centre and which is expected to climax with the summit of heads of all 'serious-minded' political parties.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sinazongwe - Chiefs in Sinazongwe district of southern province have appealed to government to restore their authority through the revival of the house of chiefs for them to participate fully in national development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The appeal was made through southern province deputy minister Elias Miyanda when he paid a courtesy call on chief Sinazongwe yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chief among other things asked government to restore the House of Chiefs, a thing he said was vital and enabled chiefs in the country share knowledge on how to force ahead in development.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We want the House of Chiefs very badly because it is an important institution,&quot; Chief Sinazongwe has appealed to government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chief has also urged government to ensure that food harvested this year was not all sold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Zambia should have food security and reduce dependence on imported food from other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chief who touched on a wide range of issues also reminded the ruling MMD to ensure local communities chose their own parliamentary candidates through primary elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said should the imposing system continue, then the MMD should have itself to blame for any outcome at the presidential and parliamentary elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Sinazongwe slammed at some local politicians whom he accused of interfering with work of civil servants in the district. he said some politicians wanted to take over government workers jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It seems some party officials here want to take over public workers' jobs and ask them to stop because the workers are trained people. We want development here,&quot; Chief Sinazongwe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Mr Miyanda said politicians were not islands and as such should work with the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said it gave him sense of pride to have chiefs who understood issues of national growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Leadership requires tact and understanding. As politicians we must share views with the people and not pushing them around,&quot; Mr Miyanda said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Zambia National Farmers Union (ZNFU) last week attributed the near collapse of the country's agricultural sector to the shift in government's priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at the official opening of the the ZNFU 91 congress last Thursday , ZNFU president Ben Kapita said the drop in the productivity of the sector and the resultant continued &quot;food begging&quot;Jwas a clear indication of the failed agricultural policies and lack of government support for the farming industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is a well known fact that even trading has received better treatment from our government than agriculture which has become a Cinderella sector,&quot; Kapita charged.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ZNFU president further called for the maximising of tax incentives in the agricultural sector to enable it meet government's target of five per cent annual growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The major factor restricting growth is limited in finance,&quot; Kapita said. &quot;It is therefore imperative to maximise the investment capacity of the sector by minimising input taxes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kapita complained that despite the Zero rating on some of the inputs, &quot;the sector is still heavily taxed by both government and now increasingly by the councils&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He further attributed the decline in production to other unattended problems the sector had been encountering such as insufficient debt relief, poor state of rural infrastructure and a failed crop marketing system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He further challenged the government to explain where funds collected from the fuel and electricity levy were being channelled, as the farmers had not benefitted from such money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We want to know where the money is or if at all the funds have been plundered,&quot; Kapita said.&quot;The Mkushi farming block which was to benefit from the funds still remains in the the dark and the feeder roads are still in an appalling state which begs the question as to how the levy was used.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reacting to Kapita's sentiments agriculture minister Suresh Desai, in an interview last Thursday, urged the ZNFU president to &quot; adequately research&quot; before critising the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Desai explained that incentives had been granted to the sector through the VAT Zero rating of most inputs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What Kapita is saying is far from the truth, and I can only say it is because of lack of information on his part,&quot; Desai said. &quot; I advise him to research adequately before criticising government efforts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Desai added: &quot;The government is still committed to the development of the agriculture sector as can be seen by the coming of the ASIP programme although I must admit that it will take long to implement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Desai could not disclose which areas had benefitted from the money collected from the fuel and electricity levy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Desai also disclosed that his ministry was setting up a US$10 million Rural Investment Fund that would be coordinated by the ZNFU executive director, George Grey.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Zambia is losing over US$100 million annually due to un level trading ground with South Africa, disclosed Zambia Association of Manufacturers (ZAM) chairman, Mark O'Donnel in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> O'Donnell said &quot;lack of seriousness&quot; in balancing trade had cost the country greatly in terms of export earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;South Africa has a lot of protective tariffs in some cases as high as 80-90 per cent,&quot; O'Donnell carped. &quot;When you add VAT on the exports, you find that Zambian goods cannot compete with their goods.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ZAM chairman said Zambia's exports to South Africa were only R100 million while her imports from the same country were R1.1 billion per annum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This imbalance is costing us a lot of money in terms of exports that can't be executed because of high tariffs in that country,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the ministry of Commerce, Trade and Industry is trying to negotiate a non-reciprocal preferential trade agreement with South Africa and the Southern African Customs Union(SACU) that will secure a market for selected products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The purpose of the proposed agreement is to secure market access for a selected range of exportable products from Zambia which have a market potential in the Republic of South Africa and indeed the SACU,&quot; said Oliver Sikafweba, director of trade at the commerce, trade and industry ministry, in reply to a Post query, adding: &quot;Zambia exports are at present not in a position to penetrate that market because of high external tariffs of the customs union.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commerce, trade and industry ministry has since submitted a draft trade agreement to South Africa under which a joint study group will be formed to analyse the list of products submitted by Zambia with a view to arriving at a list that would be agreeable to both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A consultative meeting has been set for August this year, where SACU ministers will meet to discuss among other issues Zambia-SACU Trade Agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Export Board of Zambia(EBZ) feels little will come out of the August meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The conclusion of the trade protocol in August may not be finalised soon because South Africa is dragging its feet on the matter,&quot; EBZ executive director, Mwansa Musonda, said in an interview last Friday, adding: &quot;We shall only start benefitting when they remove protective tariffs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And a source in the South African government disclosed that the Zambian government has been told that it will be very difficult to set new trade terms which will take away the good deals businessmen have negotiated for themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot; Your former minister of commerce, Dipak Patel came here and he was told the South African government cannot work to reverse the excessively good incentives its businessmen have gotten for themselves from the Zambian government,&quot; the source revealed. &quot; South Africa, unlike Zambia, has sacred cows.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But W.J. Swanepoel, a councillor at South African High Commission in Lusaka says her country labours under a number of constraints at the moment which have slowed it down from taking rapid decisions on bilateral trade agreements and related matters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The government is losing millions of Kwacha in tax revenue as smuggling of commodities from around the southern African region continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But even the marketeers of the imported goods are complaining of loss of business due to high taxes and the Kwacha's decline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In April 1995, the government introduced Value Added Tax and the Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) changed personnel at all points of entry into the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the measure does not seem to have helped as problems of smuggling persist, though at a lower level, ZRA claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The petty traders, having had their significance ignored by the government, complain that duty on imported products especially goods imported by local traders, is too high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Outside Luburma Market in Lusaka, an illegal market now commonly referred to as &quot;Zambia-Zaire&quot;, has over a thousand 'international' traders who have set up makeshift stalls. Regardless of the crowded conditions, the traders say business is slow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The problem with our customs people is that they have no uniform taxes.  For the same type of goods and the same amount, your friend will be charged one fee and you another. Nothing is written down as to what people are supposed to pay and such practice leads to dishonesty among traders,&quot; said Brian Kapoba, who often imports goods from Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;People are using trucks and other dubious routes to pass the goods through without a customs check. Then at least all you have to worry about is the depreciation of the Kwacha,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zambia Revenue Authority failed to reply to a written query on the matter yesterday but had previously said they had collected more revenue from taxes in 1995 than had ever been recorded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Estelle Masiwa, from Dar-es-Salaam, said the devaluation of the Kwacha had disappointed a number of Tanzanian and Zimbabwean traders who had incurred huge losses during the last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We don't have a lot of capital and any changes to Kwacha affect us greatly. We calculate the required profit from our goods at the time we start off but by the time we sell our goods here, the Kwacha would have depreciated further and our profit is reduced if at all you get any,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Susan Katembo from Luapula Province said it was now taking longer for her goods to sell as even the customers had reduced in the past two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The dollar is getting more expensive to buy and we find ourselves literally being out of business because we cannot afford to increase our capital. Anyway, we still keep trying to find ways of selling our products because we have to make a living. Even when we collect our goods from TAZARA in Kasama we haggle with the officers otherwise you work for nothing as they charge so much,&quot; she said. &quot;If only ZRA could reduce their duty to manageable levels, they might even get more revenue from us. We would be more willing to pay and they would even lessen corruption amongst their ranks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka City Council public relations manager, Daniel M'soka, said the council had been trying to work with immigration to flush out illegal trading but nothing had been done so far because there was not enough manpower.  Instead, the council has opted to levy the traders a K500 fee sometimes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Opposition UNIP president, former president of the Republic of Zambia Kenneth Kaunda, yesterday maintained no one is going to bar him from contesting this year's presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Kaunda, who was speaking at his 72nd birthday braii at Lusaka's Dora Tamane Nursery School yesterday, insisted he was a very peaceful freedom fighter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Nothing will stop me from contesting the elections,&quot; president Kaunda declared in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The MMD has no powers to stop me and I will only be stopped by the will of Zambians at the elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UNIP leader charged that while he was a peaceful man, the MMD has presented him as a very violent man for fear of losing the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I fought colonial rule peacefully and I will fight this government peacefully. I am a very peaceful man, I have taken peaceful means of struggle purely on principle,&quot; president Kaunda said. &quot; But this government is telling people that Kaunda is violent, which is not true.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Former president Kenneth Kaunda was stabbed at Ndola's Mushili township on Sunday April 21 and opposition UNIP has accused President Frederick Chiluba's government for the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIP claims the government's denial of the incidence that was not announced or reported by anyone was meant to cover its tracks in case of any fatality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UNIP president was attacked by an unknown assailant soon after his Mushili rally.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I didn't know I had been attacked until I saw blood on the back of my hand,&quot; Kaunda revealed in an interview in Lusaka yesterday. &quot; Soon after I felt a very uncomfortable pain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda said he was first treated in Ndola and later in Lusaka. And both local medical specialists said whatever it was Kaunda was lucky it missed the veins on the back of his hand which if they had been affected could have been fatal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They advised further tests for poisons and treatment in South Africa where the former president was flown last Thursday in a trip only known to his inner circle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;No-one at Freedom House knew about it. I only knew about it on Thursday just before he flew out. Where did the ministry of Foreign Affairs get its information? Why were they anxious to talk about it? Why do they deny what UNIP did not talk about?&quot; asked the party's administrative secretary Basil Kabwe in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Ministry of Foreign Affairs surprised the party when on Saturday, April 27 it refuted what it termed &quot;rumours in the foreign media that Kaunda was stabbed at a recent rally on the Copperbelt&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think they knew about it because they orchestrated it themselves and they are behind the attack,&quot; said UNIP vice- president Inyambo Yeta in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIP insists the party never released any information on the attack which occured after the Ndola rally as Kaunda's convoy was slowly making its way through the crowd and the former president was greeting some supporters.  According to Kaunda no one in UNIP issued any statement and while in South Africa he had strict instructions issued &quot;not to speak to the press&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And UNIP central committee member, Rabson Chongo, who last year received a hand written letter warning the former president not to accept to be transported by air to Ndola to face charges of illegal assembly was convinced the attempt was made by a government agent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The government has given itself away by lack of concern. It didn't come to UNIP to verify or find out so they can investigate the matter,&quot; Chongo said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Kaunda has now linked the latest incident to previous attempts on his life, including one outlined in the Zambia Intelligence Security Service documents from between Lusaka and its Mansa office published in The Post on June 23 last year. The letter dated May 29, 1995 and addressed to the director of 'B' branch revealed a plan to assassinate Kaunda should he show signs of being re-elected president. And when this letter was later presented in Parliament by Malambo Member of Parliament, Wezi Kaunda, the Speaker waived his immunity and the government threatened to have prosecuted under State Secrets Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't know who could have done it but I have now linked it with past threats to my life,&quot; Kaunda. &quot;We should be careful not to plan to take life cheaply. We have never planned to take life. It's them who are doing so in a 'Christian' nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Families of the national soccer team players who died in a plane crash off the coast of Gabon yesterday appealed to President Chiluba to release the air disaster report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at the memorial service at the burial site Lusaka's Independence Stadium, the families' committee chairman Edmond Mutale, father to the late goal wizard Kelvin, also warned politicians not to make political gain out of the Gabon report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Whilst we appreciate all the assistance that has come our way from government, we regret that our government has not been forthcoming and sincere concerning the plane crash,&quot; Mutale told the wailing widows.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We the bereaved families are compelled with a burning desire to know the contents of the report, even today they are not with us because to them the chapter is closed, and all is well, shame.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mutale added: &quot;Promises on the release of the report have continued to come from the corridors of power without any fruits at all, it's a shameful thing. We are appealing to you Mr. President with tearful faces to let us know the contents of the report because we are the ultimate losers, and this will erase suspicions haboured by the families concerning the disaster.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mutale told politicians that anyone trying to make political gain out of the Gabon report will be considered inhuman by the families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If these politicians have correct information about the report, why not tell us, instead of using it to achieve their selfish goals,&quot; Mutale warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The memorial service was attended by UNIP president Kenneth Kaunda and a number of his central committee members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No government official was present, but MMD national secretary Michael Sata defended government saying they were not invited by the families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The service was not organised by government, but the families, and for one to attend such functions, you need an invitation card, we never got any,&quot; Sata said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - City of Lusaka football club has requested the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) and the sponsors of the BP top-eight cup, BP Zambia Limited, to change the format of the competition to save clubs from liquidation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chairman, Simataa Simataa, whose club has written to FAZ, BP Zambia and all clubs taking part in this year's BP top-eight competition, pointed out transport costs clubs have to spend during the competition as one reason the sponsors have to change the format.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If they can allow the cup to be played on a two-leg system where all clubs play both away and at home to get something from gate takings, and also if they can increase their money involved in the whole cup because as it is now, it does not make any economic sense because clubs overspend in preparations, while some clubs are even knocked out in the first round,&quot;observed Simataa in an interview last week Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FAZ general secretary, Hermann Mpashi confirmed getting the letter from City which has also been sent to Mufulira Wanderers, Power Dynamos, Zamsure, Kabwe Warriors, Roan United Konkola Blades and Lusaka Dynamos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Yes I have got the letter from City but we are still to sit as FAZ to look at it. I think it will be better if you can wait for sometime,&quot; said Mpashi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In South Africa, the sponsors of the BP top-eight cup settle camping and transport costs for all participating teams which is not the case in Zambia where BP only pays the top four teams after the finals of the competition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But some vetoed candidates believe the move to create confusion on the use of the constitution was planned by the interim FAZ executive to prolong its stay at Anchor House.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They have decided to veto some of us out of the elections using the 1994 constitution when they know for sure that currently there are constitutional debates going on. In normal cases, FAZ must have known that it is not yet clear as to which constitution the general elections will be based on, we can either use the 1994 one or the one currently under review,&quot; said Profund Warriors secretary George Kasengela, whose bid for a sub-committee post was thwarted by the veto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But FAZ general secretary, Hermann Mpashi, said his association was going to use the 1994 constitution for the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We will use the 1994 constitution and if there will be any changes in the use of the constitution, we will be directed by the council on Saturday.  The elections are surely on, said Mpashi, who explained that should there be any need to use the reviewed constitution, his office will follow what the council will decide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;People must not think I am making personal decisions , I am just following the 1994 constitution. Who am I to start changing things,&quot; wondered Mpashi at a press brief yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And aspirant for the vice-chairmanship, James Mazumba, who has also been axed by FAZ, is also angered at the turn of events.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - An application was last Friday filed in the Lusaka High Court to stop the government from enacting the Constitution of Zambia (Amendment) Bill number 17 of 1996 into the supreme law of the land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC), represented by human rights and constitutional lawyer John Sangwa, last Friday applied to the High Court for a judicial review of the government's decision to amend the present constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the case that will be heard by justice Bobby Bwalya today, ZDC is claiming that what the government is calling an &quot;amendment&quot; is in fact an adoption and enactment of a totally new constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In their application ZDC claims that the decision by President Frederick Chiluba and his cabinet to amend the present Constitution in the manner suggested in the bill &quot;is ultra vires of Article 79 of the Constitution in that it seeks to alter or destroy the basic structure or framework of the present Constitution&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZDC claimed that the proposed amendment to the preamble will alter the secular character of the present Constitution hence change its basic structure or feature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also pointed out that the proposed amendment bill's Article 91(4) (f) which accords presumptive constitutionality to legislative Acts and stops judiciary inquiry into legislative motives or the regularity of the legislative process &quot;will undermine the idea of judicial review and the concept of separation of powers, checks and balances which are the basic features or structures of the present Constitution&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also argued that the 'amendment' alters the basic features of the present Constitution by disqualifying persons, who are eligible under the present Constitution, to stand for election as president of the Republic of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The proposed amendment in Article 98(5) of the bill is also said to be seeking to alter the basic structure of present Constitution by undermining the independence of judiciary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZDC also wants the court to consider an order prohibiting the President Chiluba, his cabinet, or the national assembly from proceeding with the consideration, discussion, debate or the enactment of the bill into law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The court will have to define the term amendment because the Constitution of Zambia ( Amendment) Bill seems to be bulkier than the present Constitution,&quot; claimed ZDC president, Dean Mung'omba, in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bill has 139 articles whereas the present Constitution has 113.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the bill seeks to repeal nine out of ten parts of the existing constitution. Only part three of the existing Constitution has not been touched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It remains to be seen whether parliament will continue with the debate on the bill in view of the fact that it is now in court. Previously, parliament has deferred debate on matters in court describing them as &quot;subjudice&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, chief government spokesman, information minister Amusaa Mwanamwambwa, said yesterday he could not say much on the matter as it is in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I can only say the government is looking forward to the high court decision if ever the high court will accept such a case. As for stopping debate on this issue, we all know that parliament is the autonomous law-making body,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition National Party spokesman, Sam Chipungu, said the debate on the Constitution bill would never rest until it was decided by a constituent assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We want to hear what the people submitted to the Mwanakatwe Constitutional Review Commission in parliament and not government views,&quot; he said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And UNIP member of parliament, Professor Patrick Mvunga, has also said his party has been studying the issue with the view of taking it to court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We, as UNIP, have been looking at the issue with the view of taking it to court because it is now clear that the MMD do not want to listen to people,&quot; Professor Mvunga said in an interview yesterday. &quot;But since ZDC is also taking the case to court, we wouldn't mind a joint court action.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, D.C. - Letter to President Clinton dated April 26, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are writing to join our voice to those of the many Liberians and friends of Liberia who are urging sustained and energetic US involvement in restoring the prospects for peace desired by the vast majority of Liberians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We applaud your recent decision to allocate an additional $30 million to the West African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) to enable it to maintain a level of stability sufficient to permit longer-term peace efforts, as well as urgent humanitarian relief, to take place. And we welcome the assurance that the US will isolate anyone taking governmental power in Liberia by force.  However, our consultations with colleagues in the churches and other organizations, both with Liberians and others familiar with that country, convince us that this alone is certain to be insufficient. Without a higher level of US engagement, renewed peace efforts will be vulnerable to violent and perpetual collapse.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The primary responsibility for the war over the last six years--and for the latest violence in Monrovia--lies with the leaders of the Liberian armed factions, who have put their personal quests for power above the desire of Liberians for peace. The record of the West African peacekeeping force, which brought some stability to parts of Liberia, has been mixed, and its failure to react when violence broke out early this month was a proximate cause of the high level of destruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the international community must also shoulder a large share of the blame for the current disaster. And in the case of Liberia, with 150 years of close US ties, &quot;international community&quot; means above all the United States.  The US failure to respond to the initial outbreak of war in 1989-1990 cost the lives of thousands of Liberians and consumed close to $500 million in emergency aid. Many observers warned that the latest peace agreement was doomed to collapse without adequate international support for disarmament of the militias and for the peacekeeping efforts of ECOMOG. That support did not come--a failure which invited a costly humanitarian disaster and set the scene for the evacuation of US citizens and many other foreign residents earlier this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would be an unacceptable betrayal of our moral values and abdication of leadership for the US simply to walk away. But half-hearted efforts to assist are highly likely to sow the seeds of repeated failure. Our response must be thoughtful, holistic, and effective. Liberians, other Africans, and the rest of the world are looking to the US for leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We do not venture to suggest the details of what needs to be done. But there are several points that stand out as indispensable:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1)West African states must continue to play a central role in peacemaking and peacekeeping, regardless of the shortcomings of their past involvement. While Liberians want peace, they are at the mercy of small armed factions. West African nations are willing to provide the security necessary for Liberians to survive and to rebuild their country. But these states on their own do not have the diplomatic clout, the credibility, or, above all, the logistical resources to do the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It follows that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (a) The US must continue energetic and consistent engagement in the diplomatic process and be willing to demonstrate its urgent concern. Africans and friends of Africa perceive a double-standard in the disproportionate attention which the US government appears to devote to crises in Europe and the Middle East as compared with equally serious ones in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (b) The US must provide promptly the necessary material means for ECOMOG to be an effective peacekeeping, and, if necessary, peace enforcing presence.  We understand that adequate ECOMOG engagement may entail costs as high as $12 million a month over several years, for which the US would have to take primary responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (2)There is need both for immediate action and for long-term engagement.  Even if the latest cease-fire holds, humanitarian agencies cannot return without some assurance that they will not need a new rescue operations a few weeks or months later. And that means the rapid reestablishment of a safe haven in Monrovia. At the same time, however, the longer-term peace process needs to be restarted, restructured and provided with adequate international resources to give it a real chance of success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the implications:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (a) ECOMOG must be the primary force for interim stability, first of all in Monrovia. But the US must take a proactive role in directly and immediately supplying the necessary means for it to do so. We recognize that, in practice, this may mean the need to use the US troops already on the scene, in well-defined roles to deliver logistical and communications supplies to ECOMOG. Improvements in ECOMOG performance are imperative. But for that to happen, the support must be forthcoming without delay. It is essential to avoid the lengthy delays that have sometimes accompanied earlier supplies of equipment for African peacekeepers, both in Liberia and in the case of Rwanda in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (b) Before Liberians themselves can maintain peace without the presence of an outside force, a number of steps must take place, including the disarmament of factions, the election and installation of a legitimate civilian government, and the training of at least minimal Liberian security forces, primarily police. The ECOMOG presence must be guaranteed for the minimum one to two years that such a process could entail. During this period the US should help ECOMOG to maintain adequate force and equipment levels and to achieve greater professionalism. At the same time, the US should encourage diversity within ECOMOG, facilitating the involvement of all willing West African states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (3)In order to succeed, the peace process must be linked to plans for demobilization and reintegration of combatants, must provide political space for the vast majority of unarmed Liberians and civil society institutions, and must not be held hostage by any of the leaders of armed factions. The US must play an active role in providing high-level and consistent diplomatic pressure and financial resources in support of each of these prerequisites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the implications:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (a) Continued participation by faction leaders in the political process should be contingent on their cooperation with disarmament. To prevent the leaders of armed factions from holding the process hostage they must be disarmed as specified in the Abuja peace agreement. This action should be accompanied by strong and effective pressure on neighboring countries, particularly Cote d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso and Guinea, to restrict the supply of arms to the factions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (b) Disarmament of the factions will not be possible without simultaneous planning for demobilization and reintegration of combatants and restoration of civilian economic opportunities. Delays in planning these elements were one of the critical reasons for the failure to disarm in the period since last fall. Such a comprehensive plan will be costly. But it is more practical--and, in the long term less costly--than responding to repeated humanitarian emergencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (c) Additional steps must be taken to guarantee a much more active role for civilian institutions in the transition process. Last year's Abuja peace agreement was heralded by some and criticized by others for making the faction leaders the key players in the transitional government leading to elections. This process can only work if prompt disarmament and international protection for civilians is implemented simultaneously. Unless new adjustments in the next phase create space for civilian political activity, the peace process will again be doomed to collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In closing, we would like again to thank you for your recent decision to provide more support for ECOMOG and for the clear stand taken by the Twaddell delegation to Monrovia against any effort by the armed faction leaders to seize power. We know that in practice it will be difficult to implement the necessary high-level US commitment to promote peace in Liberia. We urge you to stay the course.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pretoria - Speech by President Nelson Mandela at a banquet in honour of<BR>President Masire of Botswana, Cape Town, 23 APRIL 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Your Excellency President Masire and Lady Masire; Deputy Presidents; Honorable Ministers; Distinguished Guests; Ladies and Gentlemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Your words of encouragement to the Constitutional Assembly this morning, Mr. President, as our legislators finalise South Africa's new constitution, will remain deeply etched in our hears for years to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They reminded us of the joy across the sub-continent 30 years ago, when Botswana gained her independence and set out on the course of democratic majority rule. They reminded us of the intervening period of blood and sweat as the people of your country sacrificed to ensure that their brothers and sisters in Angola, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa too, attain their freedom and dignity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also reminded us of the tenacity of the Botswana people to protect and nurture democracy and to achieve high rates of economic growth in the midst of adversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And so, we in South Africa have the opportunity today to play host to you, and through you, to embrace the people of Botswana in a gesture of gratitude and defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The irony of our history is that such friends and allies for generations, could only exchange official state visits only now, as the century draws to a close.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is therefore with great joy that I welcome President and Lady Masire to the free South Africa for which we have all been striving. I sincerely hope that you feel just as comfortable here as we felt in your country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are proud that the special relationship between our countries is rapidly coming of age. This underlines the fact that the bonds of history, geography and culture that nature has decreed, apartheid could not rend apart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's democracy is now almost two years old; and it is poised for even better expression in our new constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Freedom from apartheid brings the opportunity for South Africans to address their basic needs. While we have no illusion about the enormity of the task, we have no doubts about the successes we are registering. Freedom from destabilisation brings also the opportunity for building equitable relations between our countries, and for us jointly to contribute to the development of our Southern African region and our continent as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our country has much to learn from Botswana - both from your towering successes and your efforts to deal with the difficulties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All these attributes have made Botswana, and you. Mr President, a natural and capable leader of the region's collective efforts towards growth and development, within the framework of SADC. We also value your leadership in the region's efforts to promote peace and stability on our sub-continent and further afield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In all these spheres, South Africa stands ready to work with Botswana and other neighbours to attain the best for our peoples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rapid development of bilateral relations between our two countries has brought increasing co-operation in almost every area of government and the private sector. Many of our Cabinet Ministers and members of provincial executives have visited Botswana, and so have senior leaders from Botswana visited South Africa, over the last two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our bilateral discussion earlier today underlined the progress that is being made in completing negotiations on the customs union and in other bilateral and multilateral matters. So should it be among friends, neighbours and partners in development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr President;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Your visit has afforded us the opportunity to bestow on you the Order of Good Hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In doing so, we recognise not only the self-sacrificing support which you and your people gave to the people of South Africa, but also your contribution to creating the framework within which we can all pursue the still greater challenge of regional peace and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ladies and Gentlemen;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I ask you to rise and raise your glasses in drinking a toast to President Masire and the people of Botswana, and to the ever deepening bonds of friendship between our peoples. .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, D.C. Statement by Acting Spokesman Glyn Davies: The United States welcomes the April 23 recommendation by the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) that Commonwealth nations implement new measures to register their continuing disapproval of developments in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several of these recommendations are consistent with measures already adopted by the European Union (EU) and the United States. These measures include visa restrictions on members of the Nigerian regime and their families, withdrawal of military attaches, termination of military training, and an embargo on arms exports. The recommended downgrading of cultural and educational links, and the banning of sporting contacts, with the exception of the Olympics, also complement avenues the United States is pursuing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By adopting the Ministerial Group's recommendations, the Commonwealth and its member countries will be joining an increasing number of international voices calling for real progress on a rapid, transparent transition to democratic rule and respect for human rights and the rule of law in Nigeria. The Ministerial Group's recommendations and the U.N. Human Rights Commission's April 22 unanimous adoption of a resolution on the human rights situation in Nigeria demonstrate that the international community will not permit governments such as Nigeria to impede democratic progress and ignore standards for human rights with impunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We share the Commonwealth's view that the general human rights situation in Nigeria continues to deteriorate. Notwithstanding the holding of non-party local government elections in March 1996, new restrictive decrees issued by the government of Nigeria cast doubt on its commitment to the democratic process. New measures such as those proposed by the CMAG, implemented collectively, offer the best possibility of impressing upon the Nigerian leadership the urgency of taking credible, positive steps toward establishing elected, civilian government in Nigeria. We hope for the early adoption of the Ministerial Group's recommendations by Commonwealth member countries and look forward to the opportunity to consult with them on possible new multilateral economic measures.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - For four consecutive days, deliberations revolved around similar issues -- peace, unity and reconciliation among the Sudanese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite time and effort spent to end the long-standing civil war in Sudan, hundreds of thousands of Sudanese, particularly the majority Christians in the south continue to undergo untold sufferings. Recently, a group of church leaders meeting at Machakos town, some 65 kilometres south-east of the capital, Nairobi, under the auspices of the New Sudan Council of Churches (NSCC), agreed that despite the complex social and political situations in Sudan, the church must be part and parcel of the issues at hand as these affect the spiritual and general well-being of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The April 14 to 18 Sixth General Assembly of the NSCC was attended by bishops, pastors and lay persons who represented member churches namely the Catholic Church, Episcopal Church in Sudan, the Presbyterian Church of Sudan, Africa Inland Church, Sudan Interior Church and the Sudan Pentecostal Church, all of which operate in the commonly referred to as &quot;liberated areas&quot; in the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The church in Sudan is not new to the issues at hand-peace, unity, peace and reconciliation. We have discussed them for too long. But one big disappointment we have always registered is that those assigned to handle the same problems at the political level have always let us down,&quot; said Bishop Taban Paride of the Torit Diocese, when he addressed the meeting.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Catholic clergy, was referring to the &quot;lack of unity&quot; among some of the leaders of the liberation movements in the South. &quot;I have always wondered, and I want to imagine that I am not alone, why they find it difficult to work together,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishop Paride however noted that such odds should not de-rail the peace process at home. &quot;We must continue to intensify the need for peace, unity and reconciliation among them political liberation movements and Sudanese in general, with the hope that one day we shall all see the light and unite, uphold peace and reconcile with each other for the progress of the entire Sudan,&quot; he noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like others attending the NSCC General Assembly, the Torit Bishop criticised the recent signing of the so called &quot;peace agreement&quot; between Dr.  Riak Machar of the South Sudan Independence Movement (SSIM) and the Khartoum Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Posed Paride; &quot;How on earth can one person decide to commit the entire or a section of the southerners into this kind of business? If both Machar and Khartoum Government were serious about peace, they should have involved the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> entire community in the south through their liberation movements, but the contrary is what has happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On April 10, both SSIM and Khartoum Government were reported to have signed a political charter &quot;to bring to an end the on-going civil war in southern Sudan.&quot; The accord was reportedly reached after secret and persistent talks between the two sides during the last few months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a press statement then, SSIM and the Sudanese Government were agreed on the principle of peace settlement for the conflict, and stressed the unity of the Sudan within its boundaries which were inherited from British administration. The parties also resolved that an interim period be set, after which a referendum would be conducted by the people of southern Sudan to determine the political future of the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a spokesman for the SSIM commenting on reactions from the NSCC assembly told APS; &quot;This is nothing short of a workable document towards a lasting solution to the civil conflict in the Sudan. To us, it is a good move and we stand by its contents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing the Assembly, Bishop Paride said he doubted the commitment of the Khartoum Government to the recent &quot;peace agreement&quot;. &quot;We need to do a lot of homework before we accept what the Khartoum government is saying in the peace agreement. We should not be in a hurry. We need to examine ourselves and others calling for such an agreement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Catholic clergy also told the more than 50 delegates attending the NSCC meeting that Government soldiers were &quot;dropping bombs&quot; in some strategic areas in the south, with the aim to kill and maim the poor people in the region. &quot;But sometimes, these bombs have landed on children, elderly men and women or sometimes on poor creatures such as rats and snakes, but not on the targeted rebels,&quot; Bishop Paride lamented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A recent church report supports Bishop Paride's claims on bomb dropping...&quot;As an example we can report that on February 8, 1996, the Khartoum Government dropped from the air approximately 40 plastic TNT land mines near a community water supply in Ikotos, Eastern Equatoria, southern Sudan. This marks an escalation of what appears to be a concerted effort to target the civilian population of southern Sudan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the church report, the plastic land mines are sometimes designed to be especially attractive to children, and their use renders many roads impassable, thereby making it impossible to transport relief goods and personnel by land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And in an open letter, two American church missionaries, working in southern Sudan, Rev. Philip and Louise Rieman of the Church of the Brethren Missionaries, wrote to President Bill Clinton on April 10, expressing their concern over the dangers posed by the presence of land mines in some areas in Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They wrote: &quot;While we have had the good fortune not to have ever stepped on or run over a land mine, one of our own NSCC trucks has and it was badly damaged. The driver lost his hearing in one ear but was otherwise not injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Another NSCC truck hit a land mine but for some reason it did not detonate. We have personally had to drive over roads that were supposedly cleared of land mines the previous hour,&quot; the two American missionaries stated in their open letter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the NSCC General Assembly, another speaker also questioned the Khartoum Government's commitment to peace, unity and reconciliation as stated in the April peace accord against the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> background that &quot;this government is spending nearly US dollars one million daily on war and war-related issues in southern Sudan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turning to the work of churches in southern Sudan, the NSCC chairman, Rt. Rev. Daniel Zindo expressed concern not only for the loss of lives and material but the effects of the civil conflict on pastoral activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For example, we would have held our General Assembly at Leer in Upper Nile region, but this was impossible due to the current war situation in the south. This forced us to come to Machakos, simply looking for a peaceful place to hold our sixth NSCC general assembly,&quot; he noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And when the delegates resolved that the next NSCC General Assembly be held at Leer, Upper Nile, the same concerns about insecurity came up. &quot;We need to consider a lot of things before we say yes. Let us go to Leer for our seventh General Assembly,&quot; said one of the delegates, making his contribution to the discussions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And at the end of the five-day meeting, participants resolved that churches in the Sudan should sustain their calling and work for peace, unity and reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Sixth Assembly also called upon churches to promote peace making initiatives at the grassroots and intercommunities level, and involve both women and youth in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The assembly delegates also recommended that NSCC should establish desks for youth and women activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The issue about the location of NSCC headquarters also came up.  Delegates recommended that the council should consider seriously shifting the offices from the Kenyan capital, Nairobi to Narus, southern Sudan, about 50 kilometres from the Kenya/Sudan border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Responding to the proposal on office location, the acting NSCC Secretary, Mr. Rob Haarsager, confirmed that shifting to southern Sudan is a priority and the council has already put up some buildings for that purpose.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Even as the United Nations Review Conference on Certain Conventional Weapons met in Geneva, Switzerland, from April 22 to May 3 to discuss the banning of land mines, sub-Saharan Africa continues to suffer the monstrous effects of this weapon duped &quot;the poor man's weapon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Land mines are dreaded in sub-Saharan Africa because of their capacity to kill and maim decades after the conflict is over. Worse still, these weapons kill indiscriminately. Still, most of the victims are innocent people including women foraging for firewood, children playing in the fields, and herdsmen tending their flocks of livestock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed as one observer puts it, mines are conventionally purposely used to kill civilians so as to defeat the military. &quot;These weapons directly aim at civilians, and perhaps only the military will be spared,&quot; he says. During World War I, land mines were hardly used as a weapon and only five per cent of the casualties were civilians.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Rwanda and Somalia, where land mines are excessively used in ethnic conflicts, some 80 to 90 per cent of the casualties are said to be civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ahead of the Geneva Review Conference, the Secretary General of the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC), Rev. Jose Belo Chipenda, notes that people in Africa will continue to die long after formal agreements have been signed due to the heavy mining of the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Calling for a complete halt to the production, stockpiling, transfer and deployment of land mines, Rev. Chipenda adds; &quot;Just as ecologists all over the world are concerned with pollution of air and water, in Africa we are greatly exercised about the destructive effects of land mines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of the more than 100 million land mines deployed all over the world, 30 million of these &quot;toys of death&quot; are planted across at least 18 countries in Africa, mainly in sub-Saharan African soils, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Angola, ICRC reports, thousands of hectares of farmland and forest are no longer productive because of the haphazard deployment of land mines.  The civil war wrecked southern African country of 10 million people is reportedly home to some 10 million mines. Hence, in this country, every living person is a potential victim of a mine lurking somewhere to either kill or maim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Mozambique, reports the ICRC, the presence of 3 million land mines has hindered economic recovery as well as the repatriation of refugees.  Nearly 2 million Mozambicans are said to be too afraid to return to their homes lest they step on a mine and are blown away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Somalia is said to be littered with 1.5 million land mines, the Sudan between 2 and 5 million, Rwanda and Burundi 100,000 while Liberia and Ethiopia account for 600,000 mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why are these seeds of death so popular with war lords in sub- Saharan Africa? Aptly referred to as &quot;the poor man's weapon&quot;, a land mine can be procured for as little as three US dollars. Worse still land mines promise to become even cheaper with advanced technology which makes them increasingly affordable weapons for impoverished sub-Saharan Africa warlords.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What further endears the landmines to the region's warring factions, is the changing nature of conflicts, according to Nicoletta Dentico of the Rome-based International Documentation and Communication Centre (IDOC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dentico explains that the nature of warfare, more so in sub-Saharan Africa, has changed in recent decades. &quot;Many wars are long-running, internal and low intensity (consider Mozambique), often involving cash-starved militaries for whom low cost, low technology land mines are a weapon of choice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Such conflicts,&quot; she says, &quot;are not fought on conventional battlefields, rather entire countries become theatres of war.&quot; She adds; &quot;Mines, are today laid in vast quantities across whole zones, thereby taking the clear feature of strategic weapons.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other than being strategic weapons of today's sub-Saharan Africa, technological advances have made mines lighter, easier to disguise, and even more lethal. Worse still they now come in plastic camouflages which make them even more difficult to detect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a Lutheran World Federation (LWF) publication, Development, Education Forum, (December 1995), the sub-Saharan scenario appears more bleak because land mines can now be easily obtained from other African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Already three African nations, namely Egypt, South Africa and Zimbabwe have joined the list of land mine exporters to sub-Saharan countries. Thus, warring factions in the region can now purchase land mines from their own doorsteps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is now clear, as one UN official put it, that land mines are &quot;one of the worst man-made environmental disasters of the century. Other than hide the ability of such countries like Angola and Mozambique to rebuild their post-war economies, land mines also cause untold human suffering both in terms of deaths and loss of ability to work due to disabilities arising from amputations. Angola alone, reports the IDOC publication, has well over 100,000 amputees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, clearing the mines in the region has not been as easy as sowing them. Demining has been a painfully slow and dangerous procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First, has been the reluctance of rich countries and donor agencies to commit themselves towards the demining process. Then there has been the arduous process of demining itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unfortunately, the surest and most common method of mine clearance involves an individual walking in a minefield and poking a mine detecting rod into the ground until a mine is located and destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This process, referred to as prodding, is quite slow, dangerous, and very expensive. IDOC estimates that it will take seven to ten years and US dollars 30 to 40 million to rid Mozambique alone of its estimated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2 to 3 million land mines. To demine the entire African continent would cost upwards of US dollars 400 million. Worse still, whereas a mine costs 3 dollars the UN has estimated the cost of clearance including support and logistics at 300 to 1,000 dollars per mine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other than the monetary cost, there is also the cost in human life. IDOC estimates that for every 5,000 mines cleared, one disposal expert is killed and two injured. Hence, to rid the African continent of mines 12,000 experts would be blown up. Among them, 4,000 will be killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still, the slow process of demining is reportedly taking root in some sub-Saharan African countries. But this task is mainly being carried out by Non-Governmental Organizations. Already, six NGOs are said to be carrying out the demining process in Angola but only a few thousand mines are said to have been defused since early 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With these sombre facts, over 100 NGOs and church bodies met in 1991 and founded the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, which was lobbying for the banning of land mines in last week's Geneva meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Worldwide religious leaders have also added their voices to the condemnation of the manufacture, trading in and use of land mines as a conventional weapon. These include the head of the worldwide Roman Catholic Church Pope John Paul II, World Council of Churches (WCC) General Secretary Dr. Konrad Raiser, his LWF counterpart Dr. Ishmael Noko, and the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) President Archbishop Desmond Tutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whatever actions will arise from the recent Geneva meeting, one cannot help but feel sorry for the civilian population in affected regions all over the world.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kigali - At one time or other, a section of the Church in Rwanda has been accused of participating in the massacres that took place in the country between April and July 1994, leaving more than 500,000 people dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A report released in April last year by Amnesty International and Africa Watch, both human rights organizations, blamed the Roman Catholic for ideologically contributing in preparing genocide and massacres in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the end of the genocide in July, the Tutsi dominated Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) took the church in this central African country to task for ethnic hatred and collaboration with the country's rulers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elsewhere, the role of some Anglican bishops and priests during the horror, caused widespread criticism from both within and outside Rwanda. The tragic experience by the church was also realised by Seventh Day Adventist (SDA) Christians, who according to reports, were among Christians who took part in the killings in this central African country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At one time, visiting Rwandan Foreign Minister Anastase Gasena told a news conference in the Belgian capital, Brussels; &quot;The church failed, the Catholic church failed,&quot; adding that Catholics should make deep reforms in their evangelical message. The three churches in the mainly Christian nation have not been spared embarrassment with reports of priests having played a role in the genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Rwanda War Crimes Tribunal was created by the United Nations Security Council in November 1994. It set up operations in Arusha, Tanzania, with the mandate of trying those charged with involvement in the ethnic carnage between January 1 and December 31, 1994. So far, a number of suspects have either been imprisoned, put under house arrest or under investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In France, a Rwandan Catholic priest, Wenceslas Munyeshyaka was placed under investigation on suspicion over the killings in his country. He was accused of giving Hutu militia lists of Tutsi sympathisers later taken away and killed as part of the genocide characterised by ill-treatment, torture and degrading activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fr. Wenceslas who was a vicar at Holy Family Church fled to Zaire and later to France when the Tutsi-led RPF finally seized power in July 1994, but terrible accusations followed him and was indicted. Moreso, two Rwandan nuns who fled to Belgium were also accused of complicity in the massacre. In Rwanda, thousands of victims died in churches where they had sought refuge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The London-based human rights organisation, Amnesty International reported that clergy told people fleeing the massacre to seek refuge in churches where they would then be killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Adventist Press Service also reported that a retired Seventh Day Adventist minister Elizapham Ntakirutimana was put under investigation for his suspected involvement in the genocide in Kibuye during violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A report in the Washington Times daily quoted a spokesman of the International Criminal Tribunal in Rwanda, naming Ntakirutimana as one on the list of persons presumed guilty. Another suspect is an Italian monk who was put under house arrest by Rwandan authorities in June 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In April the same year, Rwanda Bishops' conference reported two nuns were being held in the Rwandan capital, Kigali along with two Priests in Gitarama and two others plus a seminarian in Butare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Rwanda's Bishops Conference had condemned earlier massacres, protested the use of ethnic ideology and called for ceasefire in the civil war, the situation could not be contained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rev. Jean Baptiste Rugengamanzi, a Hutu heading the Kigali diocese, described as unconfirmed, reports by Africa Watch and Amnesty International human rights groups, that priests actively encouraged murderers and carried guns themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What could the church do? The church has taught people to love, it has taught charity not to kill, I think our role was to invite people to make peace and we did. Had we to go fighting with guns?&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rev. John Skinnader, an Irish priest working with an Irish relief agency, said the massacres in Rwanda were of a profound nature that went to the core of human identity - a ceremony that asserted human dignity - a dignity that countless Rwandans lost when they disobeyed the commandment 'Thou shall not kill'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite criticism, humiliation and embarrassments experienced by Christians worldwide, top church leaders made pastoral visits to the war-wrecked Rwanda. Top on the list was the spiritual leader of the worldwide Anglican communion, Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Archbishop Carey visited Rwanda for the first time in May 1995 with the purpose of demonstrating the prayerful support and compassion of the worldwide Anglican communion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During his visit, Carey further witnessed the distrust that the people had against the church when he preached at Kigali Episcopal Church--it was a little more than half full.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In July 1995, South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu who is also the President of Nairobi-based All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) visited Rwanda and called for understanding towards clerics who might have taken part in the genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rev. Jose Chipenda, the General Secretary of the AACC who accompanied Archbishop Tutu, said the visit was intended to show the solidarity of African churches with the suffering people of Rwanda and to encourage reconciliation for the good of Africa and for the sake of present and future generations in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Roman Catholic Pope John Paul II in a letter addressed on March 14, 1996, to Bishop Thaddee Ntihinyurwa, the President of Rwandan Bishops Conference, said the church cannot be held responsible for wrong deeds of its members who violated church teachings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And in November last year, the SDA world President Robert S. Folkenberg during a visit to the small Central African nation, called on the nation's clergy to shun claims of names and forms of Christianity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Folkenberg addressed about 20,000 people, Rwandan Vice President Paul Kagame and Adventist Pastor included. He noted that the future of Rwanda does not lie in the hands of Government and civil authorities but it is up to spiritual leaders to call for conversion and transformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still, Folkenberg could not understand why the spirit of the Gospel was not sufficient to stop the killings in a nation where 95 per cent of the population including almost 300,000 Adventists claimed Christ's name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The communication Director of SDA world headquarters Ray Dabrowski says the SDA church condemns atrocity in any form. &quot;We are supportive of the initiatives of the Rwandan Government to bring to justice those who are responsible for illegal activities in the country's crisis,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pope John Paul II on the other hand called on Catholic faithful involved in the killings to be brought to trial. All members of the church who sinned, the Pontiff declared, must have the courage of bearing consequences of their deeds against God and their neighbours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to available figures in Rwanda, SDA Christians are organised into 806 churches with 285,000 baptised adult believers. The Anglican Church, commonly known as the Episcopal Church is said to be a minority in this former Belgian protectorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Church reports say possibly 225 SDA church workers and 10,000 members died, while nearly 250 Catholic priests, nuns and missionaries were killed during the 1994 massacres in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Catholic church in Rwanda is said to have experienced divisions long before the April 6 mysterious plane crash that killed Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana and his Burundian counterpart Cyprien Ntaryamira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Being one of the institutions open to Tutsi, half the Catholic clergy were Tutsi in a country that was more than 80 per cent Hutu. But this was unbearable according to Rev. Octave Ugira, a Tutsi and Jesuit priest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ugira said, &quot;militiamen used to say we have nothing to do with God. They said virgin Mary was a Tutsi woman and she had to be killed.&quot; Ugira heads a church centre in Kigali where 17 priests and nuns were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The church in what was predominantly a Catholic nation lost its moral authority and it will be difficult for leaders to rebuild it. A good number of Rwandan say they still believe in God but not the Church at large.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - As Uganda's election campaigns intensify, representatives of the three presidential candidates have issued a joint communique in which they pledge to ensure that credible elections take place in the country without further incidents of violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a joint statement issued on April 18 here at a consultative meeting for all representatives of the three presidential candidates, which was also attended by the Interim Electoral Commission (IEC) Chairperson Mr. Stephen Besweri Akabway, the three, namely Yoweri Museveni, Mayanja Kibirige and Paul Kawanga Ssemogerere agreed to keep to the IEC rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IEC regulations specify among other issues that no supporters of any presidential aspirant should carry a campaign poster belonging to another candidate and there should be no provocation from supporters if a different candidate is holding a rally.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These guidelines were issued earlier by the commission but they have often been disregarded. Supporters of Museveni have continued to disrupt meetings of opposition candidates as police look on helplessly. The IEC only acted after two incidents (one at Makerere University and the other at Bwaise, north-east of Kampala, in which the opposition supporters were provoked and they hit back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, leaders of the rightwing Evangelical Churches in Uganda, commonly referred to as Balokole or &quot;Born Again&quot;, have issued a statement in which they disassociate themselves from the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) of Joseph Kony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The eight pastors say Kony did not belong to any of their churches and that his political, military and religious programmes are parallel to theirs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Chairman of Born Again Churches of Uganda, Pastor Simeon Kayiwa said they were prompted to make the clarification following remarks made by presidential aspirant Dr. Paul Ssemogerere recently during his campaign rallies in Mpigi District, central Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ssemogerere reportedly said he would send the Born Again Christians to discuss the restoration of security in northern Uganda with Kony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It was herein implied that since Kony's organisation is called the Lord's Resistance Army, he belongs to our born-again camp and he, (Ssemogerere) would comfortably send us to tread the jungle which we are already familiar with,&quot; said Kayiwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We would like to state in the strongest terms that Kony's organisation or Kony himself have nothing to do with our churches and we should not be linked with him as a fellow brother in Christ,&quot; the Balokole chairman clarified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The pastors said the purpose of their communique was to clear their name and not to attack or discredit Ssemogerere as a presidential candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When contacted about the claims made by the Born Again, a spokesman of Ssemogerere who chose anonymity dismissed the statement saying, &quot;We have heard about the two leaders, Kayiwa and Sserwadda visiting Rwakitura where they were allegedly given money to distribute.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He went on; &quot;If you are careful, you will hear of more night prayers than before, but do they even have proof that Ssemogerere has ever made such remarks? Mpigi is not very far from here, which particular place are they talking about so that you people (referring to the press) can go and find out for yourselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The spokesman cautioned people against taking everything that is said as the Gospel truth. He further advised the Balokole that if Ssemogerere had made such a careless remark then they should have taken up the issue with the person instead of rushing to the newspapers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cairo - Four gunmen raked a crowd of Greek tourists with bullets at a hotel near the pyramids on April 18, killing 18 and wounding 13 in the worst massacre of foreigners in four years of violence pitting the Egyptian secular government against Muslim fundamentalists seeking to turn the country into a hardline Islamic republic of the Iranian type.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The assailants, Muslim militants of the Jamaa Islamiyya fundamentalist group, armed with Kalashnikovs and a revolver sprayed the holidaymakers at point blank range outside the Europa Hotel on the road leading to the Giza pyramids outside Cairo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 18 killed in the carnage, most of them elderly, including 14 women, were Greek tourists on an Easter visit to Middle East holy sites, an Interior Ministry spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Twelve members of the Greek group were also injured along with an Egyptian who worked in the hotel garage, doctors at the Al-Ahram hospital said. Seven were in serious condition.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Four men got out of a Volkswagen minibus, they kept firing for almost five minutes. It was horrible. Then they got back in the van and drove off,&quot; said Abdel Hamid Imam, a hotel worker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eline Kaminisco, in her late 50s, who was wounded in the shoulder, added: &quot;I saw two of them, wearing black shirts. Their heads were nearly shaven and they had light beards. They just opened fire and fell behind the bus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pools of blood spattered the hotel lobby and entrance in the aftermath of the massacre, a shattering blow to Egypt's tourist industry which has been recovering from previous attacks in which 12 tourists had died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But on April 20, Egypt's main armed militant group, the Jamaa Islamiyya, claimed responsibility for the killings but said the attack had been aimed at Israelis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Jamaa (The Islamic Group) statement said: &quot;The battalions of the martyr Talaat Yassin Hammam announce their responsibility for the April 18 operation in Giza against a group of tourists leaving 18 dead and wounding 15.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement added the operation was aimed at &quot;a group of Israeli tourists&quot; who were also staying at the Europa Hotel where the attack took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;All Jewish interests on Egyptian territory are targeted until the end of the Zionist enemy's operation against Lebanese territory,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The four-star Europa Hotel, five kilometres from the pyramids, is a favorite place for Israeli Arab tourists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attack coincided with the height of an Israeli military offensive in Lebanon, which has provoked Arab anger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The victims were waiting to board a bus to go to the Mediterranean city of Alexandria shortly after breakfast when the attackers jumped out of the van and opened fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tourists said they were part of a group of around 150 Greek tourists travelling around churches and holy sites in the region. They had arrived in Cairo from Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Interior Minister Hassan al-Alfi, as well as the Tourism and Defense ministers visited the scene of the attack and victims at the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Western tourists have been a target for Muslim militants waging a bloody anti-government campaign since March 1992, in which close to 1,000 people have been killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The last deadly attack on tourists was in October 1994 at the Red Sea resort of Hurghada. The Jamaa Islamiyya, the main outlawed fundamentalist group in Egypt, claimed the attack in which two German tourists died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first time Islamic militants targeted tourists was in October 1992 in Asyut, southern Egypt, when a British holidaymaker was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Egypt's tourist revenue -- its fourth biggest earner according to Western estimates -- plummeted by more than half from US dollars 3 billion in 1992 to 1.3 billion in 1993 as holidaymakers were scared off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But during a relative lull in 1995 tourist numbers rose 20 per cent to top 3 million for the first time in three years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cape Town - South African legislators took a significant step towards a new constitution on April 19 when a series of agreements between parties mopped up some of the key outstanding issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The agreements, coming after an all-night session, will allow a draft bill to be drawn up and published immediately and submitted for debate to the Constitutional Assembly the following week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main agreement is over the establishment of a minorities commission, whose aim will be to protect the language, rights and culture of ethnic minorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Negotiators from the white Afrikaans-speaking right wingers of the Freedom Front and the dominant African National Congress (ANC) reached the agreement at a closed-door session in the small hours of April 19.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Members of all parties involved greeted the agreement as a triumph, ending two years of tough debates on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Retired general Constand Viljoen, leader of the Freedom Front gave credit for the deal to the ANC, saying it was &quot;a brave move.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think it is a very great achievement,&quot; he said, adding that he believed the basis of the deal could be exported to other parts of Africa that are also grappling with the concept of self- determination for minorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political analysts agreed that the agreement justified the way Viljoen split the Afrikaner right-wing, which was determined to boycott the first all-race election of April 1994, and took his followers into the new Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MPs and senators broke into relieved applause at the end of the debate, but when sleepless negotiators broke up early on April 19, they left a number of tendentious issues still unsettled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These include a highly contentious clause in the draft Bill of Rights creating both a right tote and a right to lock-out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the agreement on the minorities, questions of language and education remain to be formally concluded, although the agreement will have eased the way for this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The property clause, which attempts to lay down limitations on the right to own property under what circumstances and owner may be expropriated, still needs final settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cyril Ramaphosa, the chairman of the Constitutional Assembly, said he believed the political agreement is there, but the language needs to be refined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another key breakthrough came in when the ANC and the National Party agreed to a compromise on the reference to God in the preamble to the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The present constitution starts: &quot;In humble submission to Almighty God, the people of South Africa declare...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Non-believers have objected to the wording, while members of Christian, Muslim and other faiths have insisted on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new version omits the reference, beginning: &quot;We, the people of South Africa, recognise the injustices of our past...&quot; but includes -- in six languages -- a sentence seeking the blessing of God upon South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new bill is now being drafted by the Constitutional Assembly's legal advisers and will be debated in the next session of the full assembly, which is made up of all 490 members of both Houses of Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the present interim constitution, the Assembly is required to pass the new constitution by a two-thirds majority within two years of the inauguration of President Nelson Mandela on May 10, 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Admitting that the morning had been packed with emotion, Ramaphosa said after the conclusion of the debate: &quot;We can look forward with confidence to adopting the Constitution on May 8.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ramaphosa, the ANC secretary general who presided over the Constitutional Assembly -- made up of both houses of parliament sitting together -- chaired the session and agreed to the adjournment provided sub-committees spent the time going through the technical refinements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ramaphosa announced at the weekend that he would leave parliament for the private sector once the new constitution takes its final form and is cleared by the Constitutional Court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kigali - The last United Nations troops in Rwanda left the war-torn tiny central African nation on April 19 after nearly four years of a mission that failed to halt an ethnic genocide that left between 500,000 and one million people dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The genocide was carried out by Hutu extremists on men, women and children of the minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN troops, 5,500-strong at their peak, were deployed in tiny Rwanda in October 1993 to oversee a power-sharing agreement between majority Hutus and minority Tutsis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Rwanda exploded into civil war on April 6 the following year after Hutu Presidents Juvenal Habyarimana of Rwanda and Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi died in a planecrash near Kigali, suspected to have been brought down by a rocket fired by the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front (RFP) rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Habyarimana and Ntaryamira both hailed from the Hutu ethnic group, which has an 80 per cent majority both in Rwanda and Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ten Belgian UN peacekeepers that were guarding Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana at the time were killed when she was assassinated on April 7, 1994 -- the first day of the three-months war that ended in July the same year, when the RPF defeated the army of Habyarimana's French-supported regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN quickly reduced the number of peacekeepers down to just 270, and with a weak mandate, they were unable to halt the slaughter by defeated Hutu militiamen and soldiers wielding guns, machetes and garden hoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The minority Tutsis who defeated the Hutu-dominated government army in the subsequent civil war never forgave the UN troops for failing to halt the genocide, and the mandate of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR), ended on March 8 after Kigali refused to countenance a further extension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN troops were also criticised -- but this time by the Hutus -- for standing by a year ago as troops of the new Tutsi-dominated army shot at massed Hutu refugees in the Kibeho displaced persons' camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Estimates of the number of dead there ranged from an initial UN count of up to 8,000 -- later amended to around 2,000 -- to a government count of 300.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the UN troops left, UN Undersecretary General Marrack Goulding also arrived in Kigali the same day to discuss the equipment the UN was leaving behind for the Rwandans -- material rejected as &quot;junk&quot; by Claude Dusaidi, political adviser to Vice President and Defence Minister Paul Kagame, Rwanda's new military strongman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dusaidi also charged that the UN mission owed some US dollars 2.5 million in taxes, rents, and benefits for local staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The departure of the UN forces came as some 1.7 million Hutu refugees still remained in sprawling camps in neighbouring countries, terrified that they will face retribution if they return, despite government assurances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Refugee leaders say the departure of the troops and military observers will reinforce these fears.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> East London - South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission looking into atrocities during the era of apartheid ended its first week of hearings on April 19 on a shocking note, when a witness claimed that he had seen the severed hand of a black activist in a bottle at a police station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fezile Jacobs, himself a torture victim, said security police had told him it was a baboon hand, but he personally believed it was the hand of a murdered activist, Sicelo Mhilawuli.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mhlawuli's widow told the commission earlier this week her husband had been buried with one hand missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mhlawuli was one of four activists who went missing in 1985. Their mutilated bodies and burnt-out car were later found near Port Elizabeth, 300 kilometres south of this city in Eastern Cape province.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commission chairman Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu said at the end of the first session of hearings that it was clear from testimony during the week that &quot;injustice and oppression of the apartheid era did not stand a chance at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tutu said that women witnesses -- many of them widows -- who have dominated the hearings since they began on April 15, had been &quot;fantastic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission, he added, had been addressed by some 'extraordinary people... The world is amazed as it hears the harrowing stories you have told.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tutu, who broke down in tears on the second day of the hearings, said he was inspired by the &quot;willingness to forgive. Very few of us can be the same today as we were on April 15 or 16.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During testimony on April 19, black liberation movements were also implicated in apartheid-era killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One witness, Nontuthuzelo Mpehlo, told the commission that her activist husband was murdered by black activists in 1986 after being accused of betraying Black Conciousness leader Steve Biko to the apartheid police 10 years earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Biko, whose life was portrayed in Richard Attenborough's movie &quot;Cry Freedom,&quot; died in police custody in 1977.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs. Mpehlo said her husband, Mick, was shot dead in the Eastern Cape town of Grahamstown, and before his death, he had been harassed by a mob that stoned his home and accused him of being a police spy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The family of Welcome Sabatana testified to the commission that, after fleeing South Africa into exile in the 1970s, he disappeared and was feared dead in a Tanzanian camp run by the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), a South African anti-apartheid group and an offshoot of the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In another case heard by the commission, World War II veteran Bob Stanford told how he had undergone surgery eight times since he was injured in a racially-motivated 1992 attack by gunmen on a golf club outside East London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attack on the King Williams Town club, in which four people died, was one of several believed to have been carried out by the PAC's armed wing, the Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All sides in South Africa's bloody political struggle were named by the 28 people who gave testimony in the first week of the historic hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the apartheid security forces, who often used brutal means to combat resistance to the former regime's policies of racial separation, were repeatedly identified as the chief perpetrators of human rights violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The hearings marked the beginning of an 18-month search for the truth by the powerful commission, which hopes to unearth the full facts behind all atrocities between 1960 and 1993, the most turbulent of the apartheid years, no matter who the perpetrators or the victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission started to hold hearings in Cape Town from April 22 before moving on to Johannesburg and KwaZulu-Natal province.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Windhoek - The Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA) based here, has resolved to take Namibian authorities to task over a draft legislation on privileges and immunities of parliament which has been passed by the National Assembly but under debate at a subsequent level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Authorities named by MISA are the Prime Minister Rt. Hon. Hage Geingob, the Speaker of Namibia's National Assembly, Rt. Hon. Dr. Mose Tjitendero and Hon Kandi Nehova who is the Chairperson of the National Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A statement from MISA dated April 22 says, the proposed Privileges and Immunities of Parliament Bill outlaws deliberate and unintentional publication of false information on parliament and its proceedings as included in clause 24 (1) d) of the draft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bill, currently being debated on by the National Council (the Second House) also makes it an offence for anyone to intentionally or negligently publish or disclose any information that has been placed before a committee, prior to it being tabled before the house, as spelt out in clause 24 (1) g).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the Bill's non-conformity with Namibia's Constitution which guarantees freedom of press, MISA reports that a conviction under the legislation will carry a maximum of N$20,000 (US$5,000) or five years imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This south-west African country of some 1.3 million people has seven newspapers -- four dailies and two weeklies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports from MISA say that editors of different newspapers have already written to the authorities calling on the National Assembly and the National Council to ensure that the proposed bill conforms with Article 21 of Namibia's Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Article 21 guarantees free speech and media freedom as well as international treaties and standards of media freedom and free expression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the editors insist in the letter that clause 24 (1) d) and clause 24 (1) d) of the proposed privileges and immunities of parliament bill be scrapped before it becomes a law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MISA represents independent media throughout the Southern African Development Committee (SADC) region. Created in 1991, MISA propagates the role played by free pluralistic media in social and political development of any nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, MISA reports that The Advertiser reported Michael Hishikushitja, a member of the National Council for the ruling South West African People's Organisation (SWAPO) saying that parliament be empowered to ban journalists who report on classified and leaked information from the select committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The April 19 issue of the Advertiser reported that Hishikushitja wanted the ban to apply to anyone including parliamentarians who disclose information from confidential parliamentary documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Advertiser, an independed daily, reported the National Council calling for Parliament's mandate to punish or fine all those found guilty of contempt of parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reacting to the issue of the proposed bill, human rights lawyer David Smuts told MISA the penal provision of the bill cannot be justified as necessary in a democratic society, adding that the bill will have 'chilling effect' on those reporting government and parliament matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Smuts dismissed the draft bill as incompatible with Namibia's constitution which guarantees freedom of press, saying that inaccurate reporting of parliamentary proceedings should not carry stiff penalties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another independent daily The Namibian, expressed fear that clause 24 (1) d) will be used against editorial comments on controversial issues as it is not clear who would decide or define what false information is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Approached for comment by the Advertiser, The Namibian Editor, Jean Sutherland observed; &quot;All information except in few instances like state security should be in the public domain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sutherland charged that she does not see anything threatening about information contained in select committee reports even if they are confidential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MISA further quotes the Editor of The Advertiser, Carol Kotze, saying; &quot;I would find it hard to understand what contempt of parliament could actually be. These people (parliamentarians) were elected by the people and I take it that newspapers are entitled to report what is said in parliament and comment on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kotza was reported saying she felt Hishikushitja was obviously taking a leaf from the 'Zambian book'. On February 23 this year, the Speaker of Zambia's Parliament, ordered the arrest and indefinite detention of two newspaper editors and columnist for contempt of parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zambian journalists were charged with contravening the State Security Act for publishing a story in the February 5 Edition of the independent 'Post' to the effect that the government planned to hold a referendum on the adoption of a new constitution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - Faced with an upsurge in guerrilla activity in the north, northwest and the latest cross border raid from Zaire in the southwest of the country, Uganda is recalling 3,000 soldiers who were demobilised two years ago following pressure from the World Bank who wanted Ministry of Defence costs curtailed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since last November, there has been an upsurge in guerrilla activity particularly in the north of the country. Between 300 to 400 innocent civilians and scores of rebels and Uganda Peoples Defence Forces (UPDF) men have lost their lives.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most active rebel group is Joseph Kony's Lords Resistance Army (LRA) who are remnants of &quot;prophetess&quot; Alice Lakwena's guerrilla force defeated in 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The LRA are led by a former Catholic catechist and are often described by media sources as &quot;fundamentalist Christians&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They have been blamed for the killings of numerous innocent civilians in the north of the country, particularly the districts of Gulu, Apac, Kitgum and Kotido.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their most daring raid was carried out last February against a convoy of some 20 buses and goods transport lorries under the protection of the UPDF.  They killed a number of soldiers and at least 100 civilians before setting most of the vehicles on fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following that attack, an angry President Yoweri Museveni vowed to wipe them out once and for all. He promised the people of Uganda that if Kony did not flee back into Sudan where his bases are located, he would be dead by May this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other rebel group that is reportedly working with Joseph Kony is the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF). It is led by a former Colonel in the army of former President Idi Amin, Colonel Juma Oris. Both Oris and Kony are reported to receive assistance from the authorities in Khartoum, Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In mid April, an estimated 300 rebels entered the country from Sudan and have engaged the army in sporadic fighting near Pakwach, some 300 kilometres from the capital, Kampala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another surprise development is the raid into Uganda by Zaire based ex-Rwanda troops and Interahamwe militia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On April 22, they struck Kisoro trading post and over-ran a military detachment in the area, killing six people including three UPDF soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources in the UPDF say the 3000 demobilised troops were being engaged through the District Veterans Programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Army Reserve Commander, General Salim Saleh, said the men &quot;would undergo fresh drills before being deployed.&quot; Salim Saleh is a younger brother of President Yoweri Museveni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Saleh defended the decision to re-employ the men saying it was well understood &quot;the veterans are part of the Reserve Force and can be recalled to serve any time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the early 90's Uganda had some 120,000 men in the UPDF. This figure was reduced to the current 50,000 under pressure from donor nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile as we went to press a Lord's Resistance Army spokesman based in Nairobi, Kenya, Dr. Joseph Obito, said the LRA is declaring a ceasefire in their areas of operations in the north of the country which would be effective April 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Obito who was unheard of before on the LRA hierachy, said the ceasefire would allow people in the north of the country to effectively participate in the forthcoming presidential poll on May 9.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government has not yet commented on the ceasefire announcement which is &quot;conditional on government troops not attacking the rebels.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CONFUSION AS STATE OFFICIAL APOLOGISES TO KENYAN BISHOP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NAKURU-KENYA (APS) April 26 - The Provincial Commissioner (PC) in Kenya's Rift Valley Province Mr. Zachary Ogongo, on April 22 issued an ambiguous apology to outspoken Nakuru Catholic Diocese Bishop Ndingi Mwana a' Nzeki after the administrator called the clergy &quot;a liar&quot; two weeks earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The &quot;apology&quot; followed unprecedented pressure from the clergy in Kenya - both Catholic and Protestant -for the Provincial Commissioner (PC) to retract his derogatory remark and apologise to the Bishop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a one paragraph statement, the PC in Kenya's largest province said: &quot;For the sake of the comfort of the Bishop who feels his integrity is at stake, I wish to retract my statement to the extent where the matter touches him personally.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The &quot;apology&quot; is ambiguous and came only a day before the transfer of the PC in the same capacity to Central Province. He has served in the Rift Valley for less than two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover the very day the apparent apology was published by the press, the government issued its own statement negating the reconciliation gesture.  The government insisted that Bishop Ndingi did not tell the truth about the security situation in Nakuru, some 180 kilometres north-west of Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The PC's statement which did not bear the provincial administrator's signature but bore his name at the bottom, was read as a special announcement on the national radio. It described Bishop Ndingi's claims as &quot;alarming, untrue and baseless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bishop in a sermon on Easter Sunday said residents living around forest areas in Molo, within the Nakuru Diocese were apprehensive about an outbreak of fresh &quot;ethnic clashes&quot; following the entry of three lorries full of unknown people into the forests of Molo and Njoro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bishop said further that locals had begun to flee in fear of attacks on peasant farmers and cattle rustling had increased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similar signs heralded the outbreak of &quot;ethnic clashes&quot; in 1992/1993 when hundreds of peasant farmers lost their lives and thousands of others were displaced. The &quot;clashes&quot; believed to be politically instigated, mainly pitted the Kalenjin tribe against other groups including the Kikuyus and Luhya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since his Easter day sermon, overwhelming support for Mwana a' Nzeki has come from a cross section of the nation, including more than 500 priests and bishops from the Catholic and Protestant churches. The clergy urged the government to ensure that law and order prevail in Molo rather than vilify the Bishop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A plenary meeting of Kenya's Catholic bishops also expressed support for Bishop Ndingi saying nothing short of any apology from the PC would reconcile the Catholic community with the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Catholic bishops said it was not wise for the PC who was new to the area to doubt the remark by Bishop Ndingi who has been based in Nakuru for the past 25 years</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbabane, Swaziland - Women communicators meeting here from March 31 to April 4 raised concern that African Christian women are likely to see little change from within the mainstream Church by the end of the World Council of Churches (WCC) Ecumenical Decade (1988- 98) marking churches in solidarity with women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The communicators' workshop attended by 24 women from 13 countries in Eastern, Western and Southern Africa, lamented that generally, church leaders took the Decade's highlights &quot;just like any other issue about women&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The major issue is not women doing or going about their business without any interference but how to be incorporated within the mainstream and to have a meaningful role to play within the church structures,&quot; said a press statement released at the end of the workshop.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the meeting reviewed different country reports, participants agreed that although no church leader refused the activities of the decade to take place, the expected support was not forthcoming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We expected the church leaders to be fully involved in whatever we do, solidarity as we understood means women working closely with our male counter-parts. But the men have brushed us aside and it is like we are more in solidarity with ourselves than the Church on the whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If by the end of this decade we have not seen any serious commitment from our male counterparts, then we have achieved nothing in the last ten years dedicated to us by WCC,&quot; said the statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The five-day meeting discussed women and the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS); what women have achieved from the WCC Decade and the role of women in communication within the church structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was noted that although there are more women within church communication circles, very few occupy key positions and many lack the necessary training to qualify for higher posts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The women communicators resolved among other things to; Set up a strong network within the region which will make it easier to know about women activities and to encourage internship programmes with church media organisation to assist the practising women achieve better communication skills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The communicators also resolved to produce a film on the effects of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)/World Bank Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs) on women in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The workshop was organised by the Harare (Zimbabwe)-based Ecumenical Documentation and Information Centre for Eastern and Southern Africa (EDICESA) on behalf of Africa Communicators' Network. It was sponsored by WCC-Unit IV -- Sharing and Service.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, D.C. - Congressional cuts in U.S. funding for international agencies are having crippling effects on institutions of particular importance to Africa. Unless the United States pays its backlog in overdue assessments, the United Nations may be forced to shut down many of its operations within months. Key UN agencies involved in supporting African development, such as the UN Development Program, are facing drastic budget cuts. The UN peacekeeping budget is also in trouble, with unpaid bills of some $1 billion to countries providing peacekeeping troops, including France, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, Washington owes almost $1 billion to the World Bank's program of concessional development loans, a principal source of development funds for Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The crisis is so great, and the U.S. responsibility for creating it so clear, that even key U.S. allies such as Britain have suggested a policy of no representation without taxation. Others have suggested that the UN headquarters, which generates an estimated $3 billion in economic activity for the U.S. economy, should be removed to a country with a more mature sense of international responsibility.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many members of Congress strongly oppose adequate funding for these institutions. Some are seeking even deeper cuts, and a few openly advocate U.S. withdrawal. The Clinton Administration has proposed funding that would make up part of the arrears and support current programs at modest levels, but it is also pushing for drastic downsizing in many key international programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The amounts for these international institutions sound large in comparison to household budgets. But they are tiny compared to U.S.  expenditures on other federal budget items. The regular United Nations budget plus the World Bank's soft-loan disbursements to Sub-Saharan Africa (at roughly $1.3 billion and $2.5 billion per year respectively) add up to little more than half of the extra $7 billion Congress tacked on to the $220 billion U.S. military budget last fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The entire United Nations system employs fewer people worldwide than the number of Wyoming state employees. There is wide agreement that multilateral institutions do need reform. But given the number of world problems they are being called upon to deal with, they need more resources, not fewer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African countries are particularly reliant on these international agencies. While African nongovernmental organizations are critical of many international programs, particularly World Bank structural adjustment policies, they have spoken out in favor of continued funding. Multilateral support is essential not only to humanitarian relief and peacekeeping in Africa, but also to investments in education and health, and to building the capacity of African governmental and nongovernmental institutions to address the continent's long-term problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Budgeting for the U.S. share of the costs for international organizations falls into several distinct categories. Contributions to the United Nations regular budget, peacekeeping budget, and selected UN agencies are assessed at rates agreed upon in international treaties. Contributions to other UN agencies, as well as to multilateral development banks, are based on voluntary pledges approved by Congress. Almost all these accounts suffered major cutbacks in last year's battles over the fiscal 1996 budget, and they are at risk of still deeper cuts in the 1997 budget currently being debated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UN Regular Budget</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN's regular budget supports the operations of the Secretariat, General Assembly, Security Council and other core agencies, such as the UN High Commission for Refugees and the UN Environment Program. It includes funds for publication of Africa Recovery magazine and other information on African economic development. The Economic Commission for Africa is financed from this budget, as are special UN-wide initiatives to support African development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN has already trimmed almost 6% from its projected regular budget for 1996-1997. But UN undersecretary Joseph Connor said early this month that the UN would have to juggle funds by dipping into the peacekeeping budget as early as June. Even so, without new U.S. payments after the U.S. fiscal year begins in October, funds will be totally exhausted by the end of 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. arrears on the regular budget as of mid-April were at least $371 million. We are the only developed country in arrears. In 1994 the United States paid a total of $311 million towards the regular budget. In 1995 and 1996 to date, it has paid only $187 million. By contrast, 41 of the UN's 185 members have already paid their 1996 assessments in full. Countries fully paid up include developed nations such as Italy, Canada, France, and the Netherlands, as well as African countries such as Lesotho, South Africa, Ethiopia, and Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Administration's 1997 request to Congress for the UN regular budget is $314 million, $7 million short of what the U.S. owes for calendar year 1996, with nothing for arrears or for the nine months of 1997 before the next fiscal year begins. The budget request also includes $379 million to meet U.S. assessed obligations to agencies such as the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization, to which the U.S. owes $130 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UN Peacekeeping</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the post-Cold War period, the UN has been called to deal with an unprecedented number of regional conflicts around the globe. Twenty new peacekeeping operations were approved by the Security Council between 1988 and 1993, compared to only 13 during the previous 40 years. At the end of 1995 there were 16 operations under way, with the largest commitments of troops in Angola, Haiti, and Lebanon. The United States provided just over 6% of the troops. The total annual budget grew from less than $200 million in 1986 to nearly $3 billion by 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The assessment rates for UN peacekeeping were agreed in 1973. They are pegged to a country's ability to pay, with an extra 20% for permanent members of the Security Council who have veto power over any peacekeeping operation.  The United States has been responsible for 30.8% of total peacekeeping assessments. As of mid-April 1996, Washington was $764 million in arrears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. share is equivalent to slightly over 1% of the U.S. military budget. But the payments come not from the cash-flush defense budget but through accounts handled by the State Department, which are among the primary targets of budget cutters. So even the Administration proposal provides only $425 million for peacekeeping in fiscal 1997, including $142 million for arrears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are a few other countries with large arrears, notably Russia and the Ukraine. But only the United States, comments Erskine Childers, an expert on the UN system, &quot;is delinquent to this massive extent, in violation of international treaty law, not for reasons of economic difficulty, but because it is withholding its due contributions until every other member country accepts its unilateral demands about UN policies, decision-making and management.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The resultant cash crisis in peacekeeping creates enormous management problems for existing missions, and virtually eliminates the UN's capacity to respond to new crises as they emerge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> World Bank</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Critics have strongly faulted the World Bank for imposing rigid structural adjustment policies on developing countries. These programs have all too often had devastating impacts on living standards, with only mixed macroeconomic results. Observers are hoping for somewhat greater responsiveness under new World Bank president James Wolfensohn, who has promised a wider dialogue with nongovernmental organizations and stressed the importance of investment in social development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While this debate continues, many critics, particularly in Africa, affirm the importance of continued funding at least for the International Development Association (IDA). This branch of the World Bank provides loans for the poorest countries, currently those with per capita income of less than $835 a year. Almost all countries in Sub-Saharan Africa fall into this category. Of $2.4 billion in World Bank lending to Africa in 1995, more than 96% was as IDA loans rather than as standard commercially-backed loans. IDA loans, typically for 35 to 40 years, carry no interest, but only a small service charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Roughly half of IDA's funds to Africa support economic reform plans agreed with the World Bank; the rest go to investments in physical infrastructure, government capacity-building, education, population, health, nutrition and water supply. The conditions on which these loans are given, as well as the implementation of specific projects, need ongoing reevaluation.  But simply eliminating the funds would cripple many programs essential to African development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IDA is funded in three-year periods. The United States pledged a total of $3.75 billion for IDA-10 (July 1993-June 1996), of which $934.5 million is still unpaid. The Administration is proposing that the U.S. pay off its obligation to IDA-10 in fiscal 1997 and contribute $800 million a year for the final two years of IDA-11, a 36% reduction from previous levels. Even these limited amounts will be contested in Congress, however. Other developed countries have put up monies for an emergency fund for the first year of IDA-11, in which the U.S. will not participate. U.S. companies will not be eligible to bid on IDA contracts financed by other nations until the arrears are paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Voluntary Contributions to UN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States makes voluntary contributions to the UN Development Program (UNDP), UNICEF, and several other UN programs. The Administration requested $425 million for these accounts in 1996, but Congress cut this back to only $285 million. The Administration is requesting $325 million for fiscal 1997. UNDP is the UN's lead agency in promoting and coordinating development. With its annual human development reports, UNDP has led a creative rethinking of development in the post-Cold War period. Its offices in many developing countries play a key role in helping to coordinate international efforts. Some $180 million of its approximately $1 billion field program budget goes to African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. contribution to UNDP for fiscal 1996 was slashed by 56%, to only $52 million. The Administration's 1997 budget proposes restoring the allocation to $78.7 million. This is still significantly less than the amounts provided by Japan, the Netherlands, Denmark, or Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No Significant Savings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Polls show that U.S. public opinion is generally favorable to U.S.  contributions to the United Nations and other international institutions. But opponents are able to exploit the fact that most people think the sums involved are far larger than they are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cutting U.S. aid to the United Nations achieves no significant savings in the federal budget. Yet if Congress follows the pattern set last year, U.S. international obligations will be under assault as extravagant expenditures. A strong public outcry is essential: the United States should pay what it owes and work to strengthen, not undermine, the international bodies that provide crucial support for peace and development in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What You Can Do</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the drumbeat of attacks against international institutions setting the tone for debate in Congress, it is essential that Congress and the Administration hear the message that the majority of the American people do not agree with such shortsighted views. You may wish to use the following talking points:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Payment of U.S. assessments to the United Nations is a legal obligation under treaties this country has signed. U.S. failure to pay is offensive even to many of our closest allies, and will result in loss of U.S.  influence and prestige. The U.S. should also pay its fair share of other international programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * The amounts spent by international institutions--including the United Nations and the World Bank's IDA--are all relatively small. And the amount the United States is expected to contribute is minuscule in comparison to the U.S. military budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Polls show the U.S. public gives a significantly higher rating (67% favorable) to the United Nations than it does to the U.S. Congress (53% favorable). The majority of the U.S. public does not favor cuts in U.S.  support for the UN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * International programs for peacekeeping, development and other areas of international cooperation are absolutely essential for survival and sustainable progress in poor countries around the world, including many on the African continent. Starving these programs is irresponsible, shortsighted, and immoral.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of particular concern is that under the chaotic conditions, a recent outbreak of cholera in Monrovia could quickly spread.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Monday, a WHO team confirmed the presence of cholera in the BTC district of Monrovia. Forty-seven cases have also been reported at the IDP compound in Greystone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A WHO consignment of emergency medicine was airlifted by helicopter from Freetown to Monrovia. The WHO country representative in Liberia is working closely with the Ministry of Health, partner UN agencies and three local nongovernmental organizations to distribute the new supplies to hospitals and health centres in Monrovia and re-organize emergency services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WHO is also working to limit the spread of cholera and other infectious diseases in the city due to the hazardous water and sanitation conditions, and to strengthen locally available technical capacities to respond to epidemics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cholera was also reported from the following countries in the past week: Mali, Niger, Togo and Zaire.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The outbreak occurred in the village of Mayibout II, Makokou Health District, Ogooue-Ivindo Province. It was linked to the butchering, transport and preparation for consumption of a chimpanzee found dead in the forest on 24 January 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The total number of cases was 37 (20 males, 17 females) and the mean age was 27 years (range 7 months to 70 years).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Durban - An international symposium on Culture, Communication and Development is being planned for August 29 - 31, 1996 by the Human Sciences Research Council. This is the first notice and call for papers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BACKGROUND</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National and provincial policy is at present being developed in the areas of arts and culture as well as communication. The Reconstruction and Development Programme already determines policy for community development.  How should culture and communication be linked to development? What theoretical and practical considerations should inform policy development?  What role should civil society, community organisations and others, play? How can South Africa benefit from international expertise such as that of UNESCO?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As these questions must be urgently addressed, Social Communication at the Human Sciences Research Council is organising a three-day international symposium. The co-organisers are UNESCO, the Centre for Cultural and Media Studies at the University of Natal, Durban, and the Department of Communication at UNISA. UNESCO's World Commission on Culture and Development will present a number of recommendations based on consultation in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Workshops and discussion groups will be arranged to deal with the main areas. The symposium will be addressed by renowned experts, including UNESCO delegates. The opening address, concerning policy and cultural studies, will be presented by well-known Prof. Tony Bennett of Australia. He is Director of the Key Centre for Cultural and Media Policy and Professor of Cultural Studies at Griffith University, Brisbane.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - A glance at the Coca-Cola Challenge Cup standings is likely to induce a sense of shock among regular football followers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bloemfontein Celtic first, Vaal Professionals second, Wits and Moroka Swallows joint third, Manning Rangers fifth. Can this really be a competition involving all the First Division clubs?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The best-placed &quot;big name&quot; is Sundowns in eighth place, eight points behind Celtic with two matches in hand. Kaizer Chiefs are 10th, 1995 &quot;double&quot; winners Cape Town Spurs 11th and African champions Orlando Pirates 12th.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So what is going on in this one-off competition created at extremely short notice to fill the gap between the season-opening BP Top 8 competition and the much-heralded Premier League, whose birth is scheduled for July?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Well, in keeping with a long-standing National Soccer League (NSL) tradition, the number of matches played by clubs differs greatly, with five teams having fulfilled 11 fixtures while Pirates have made only five appearances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiefs are also behind schedule although it is difficult to sympathise with the fallen giants of South African soccer following their ridiculous action a couple of weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Amakhosi were due to meet Celtic at home but successfully applied for a postponement because they had three players on national duty, which is the minimum number of absentees required to cancel a fixture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Strictly speaking, Chiefs were within their rights, but considering one of the trio, Patrick Mbuthu, had never played for the first team, they certainly could be accused of sharp practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What may happen soon is that clubs like Hellenic, Swallows and Bush Bucks will have virtually completed their 17-match programme while the Amakhosi and Buccaneers have 10 matches to play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pirates managing director Irvin Khoza said at the beginning of the year that his club would field two teams -- one for international engagements and one for domestic competitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khoza has implemented this policy only partially, however, and if Pirates take advantage of the three-player rule during May they will not be seen in action at domestic level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On May 4, the Buccaneers host Ilhwa Chunma of South Korea in the Afro-Asian Cup and visit Zambia the following weekend for an African Champions' Cup second-round date with Mufulira Wanderers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The return matches in both events are scheduled for May 18 in Seoul and May 26 in South Africa with Durban the likeliest venue because Pirates are barred from staging African fixtures at FNB Stadium for one year due to crowd trouble last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Challenge Cup matches have not proved big drawcards, with the Alexandra Stadium being a notable exception when Pirates roll into the township next to Sandton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One newspaper published a depressing set of attendance figures with some barely topping three figures, leading the secrecy-obsessed NSL to ban any further disclosures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attitudes of clubs towards the Challenge Cup varies with some unfashionable ones like Celtic and Professionals viewing it as a real opportunity to achieve fame if not fortune (there is no prize money).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others, like Sundowns, used to react to losses by saying the Premier League was the real goal, although results have improved considerably since Johnny Ferreira replaced Dutch coach Clemens Westerhof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the Challenge Cup fixtures are completed at the end of May (a deadline that appears increasingly optimistic), the leading 16 clubs will qualify for the Coca-Cola Cup, an annual feature of the soccer calendar since 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The team finishing first on the standings will play the team finishing 16th, the team finishing second faces the one coming 15th, and so on until the eighth and ninth-placed teams are paired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Who plays at home in the knockout competition has to be decided, and given the extraordinary ability of the NSL to create confusion out of order, stand by for another dose of off-the- field drama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Places in Africa are at stake although there is confusion as to who gets what. Some believe the club that lifts the Coca-Cola Cup enters the 1997 African Champions' Cup and the Challenge Cup winners go into the CAF Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others claim the opposite and repeated attempts to contact NSL PRO Andrew Dipela this week failed because, as usual, his cellphone was switched off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Things go better with Coke according to the ad men. But when it comes to South African football, that slogan appears to be only partly true.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - In advertising one 'must use whatever one can to make whatever point one needs'. But are children abused by this system?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A decision by the Olympic Bid to use the photograph of an impoverished child in its ad campaign has sparked a debate on the ethics of using children in marketing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A debate on whether the use of children by advertising agencies is considered to be exploitation or not has been sparked by a six- year-old Cape Town boy whose picture is used as part of the Cape Town 2004 Olympic Bid's outdoor campaign.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ricardo Adonis's face is plastered on bus shelters, buses and billboards across the country as part of the Bid committee's campaign, spearheaded by Chikane Hunt Lascaris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adonis, in the advertisement, is seen as representative of those who will benefit the most should Cape Town secure the bid to host the Olympic Games. But last Thursday he was still begging at robots a few hundred metres from Cape Town's Olympic Bid offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the driving rain, the urchin was stationed at his regular post near the entrance to Cape Town's Waterfront.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With a soft-drink can in his hand, he knocked on countless car windows asking for &quot;small change please&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ironically, one of the drivers who donated a couple of coins was driving a white Mercedes Benz with the Olympic Bid's logo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ricardo's father Derek Adonis, who lives in Manenberg, says Ricardo was only paid R250 for his efforts and he thinks it reasonable to demand a monthly stipend for as long as Ricardo's photograph is being used in the campaign. The Bid committee says Adonis has expressed unhappiness and the committee has therefore renegotiated an agreement to ensure an increased cash payment is made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An article concerning the advertising campaign appeared in the Olympic Bid's official magazine which featured Ricardo's face on its cover. The accompanying article incorrectly referred to the boy as &quot;a street child&quot;, adding that he was seen as &quot;representative of those who will benefit the most from bringing the Games to Cape Town&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ricardo's father vehemently denies that his son is a street child. &quot;He's got a home, even though it's just a hokkie at the back of my mother-in-law's house. We told the people who took his photo that he lives in Manenberg.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adonis, who is unemployed and occasionally sells newspapers to earn money to feed his wife and four children, is not really sure who approached Ricardo to take his photograph. &quot;There was a woman called Tracy who said she wanted his picture, but she never told me what it was for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;On the day she took Ricardo to have the picture taken, they said a friend of mine could go with, because they could see we were scared to send him with strangers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They gave Ricardo R250, but my friend got R50 of that. I asked Ricardo what he wanted to do with the money and he said he wanted a television. I put some of my own money with his and bought a TV for R330.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adonis says he only realised once the campaign was launched that Ricardo's photograph was being used to advertise the Olympic Bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Friends told him they saw Ricardo's face on a bus shelter. Adonis says the photographer, (a &quot;Mr Bester&quot; who he believes is the official photographer of the Olympic Bid), said he could get another R250 if he signed a document.  &quot;I don't know what they want me to sign, I haven't seen it yet. Maybe it's a contract.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'Mr Bester&quot; is in actual fact, Dave Bester, general manager for Chikane Hunt Lascaris in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bester denies the bulk of Adonis's statements which include the one-off payment and the fact that he (the father) did not know that Ricardo was to be used for the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Bester, the boy's parents were &quot;fully informed&quot; that the agency was planning to use the photographs for the outdoor campaign. The Bid committee also says it consulted extensively with Ricardo's parents before selecting him as one of the faces in the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A letter of agreement, however, still has to be signed by Ricardo's father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Although a letter of agreement has not yet been signed by the father, it has been discussed telephonically and agreed to verbally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The conditions outlined in the letter is that Ricardo's photograph will be used in advertising materials to promote the Olympic Bid: On billboards, buses, bus shelters and selected print advertising,&quot; Bester said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He adds that the picture has been used on billboards, bus shelters and busses, but not yet in print advertisements. The picture was, however, used on the front cover of the Olympic Bid's official magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bester says the father received an &quot;initial payment of R250&quot; at the time the photographs were taken. Once the agreement is signed, another R250 will be paid, Bester said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This R500 payment is for the usage of the material for one year. Should we use the material again in 1997, Ricardo will benefit from what we call royalty renewals. The Bid company is also planning to initiate an Education Trust valued at R5 000 for Ricardo, because it is the best thing we can do for the child and an opportunity for the Bid to demonstrate its commitment to development,&quot; Bester said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adonis said he contacted Bid director Ncgonde Balfour to ask for more money. He was told President Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu didn't get paid for assisting the Bid. &quot;How can they compare me to Mandela and Tutu. They have money to feed their families, I don't,&quot; Adonis said angrily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bid argues Balfour's discussions with Adonis were to point out that Ricardo would join a list of celebrities supportive of the bid, like Tutu.  &quot;It is incorrect to infer that Mr Balfour was trying to deny any financial benefit to him,&quot; the bid committee said, adding that Balfour was instrumental in advocating the creation of an education fund for Ricardo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ricardo's father says the boy does not beg full-time but only when the family needs money for food. Last Thursday's stint in the rain earned Ricardo R43 -- more than adults get when they beg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ricardo is in Sub A at Edendale Primary School in Manenberg and only begs after the school day ends. His two brothers, Jeremy (11) and Danny-boy (14), also beg on the streets of Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The small boy with the long-lashed, soulful eyes shrugged when the Mail &amp; Guardian asked him if he enjoyed begging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The only thing I don't like is that sometimes the older boys beat me up when they say I'm begging on their spot,&quot; said Ricardo. &quot;We all got our own places to stand, and this robot is mine.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - While New Africa Investments Limited (Nail) is gearing up to bid for newspapers in the Times Media Limited stable, some of the consortium's board members are facing accusations of editorial interference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Media Workers' Association of South Africa (Mwasa), which represents the interests of the majority of Sowetan staffers, is planning to haul certain board members on Nail's subsidiary -- New Africa Publications Limited (NAPL) -- to court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Mwasa representative says the union is demanding the dismissal of the newspaper's newly-appointed managing director Roger Wellsted. Staffers claim Wellsted is interfering with the editorial content of the newspaper.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reporters at the Sowetan spoke to the Mail &amp; Guardian on condition that their names would not be published. Reporters fear their jobs and current positions will be jeopardised if they reveal their identities. The M&amp;G canvassed the opinions of mostly senior staffers on the news and political desks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He (Wellsted) is being manipulated by Nail chairman Dr Nthato Motlana, who wants us to sing the praises of the African National Congress,&quot; one staffer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wellsted denies he is being manipulated by Motlana: &quot;There is no truth in this ... I am definitely not being manipulated, nor am I manipulating anyone ... Absolutely not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He adds that at no stage are staffers instructed to hold back articles or to tone down reports. In fact, he says, there is no interference whatsoever in the newspaper's editorial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is an editorial charter which sets out guidelines and this is closely adhered to by all on the newspaper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wellsted says Mwasa has previously accused him of having excessive power over editorial executives, but its allegations were unfounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sowetan editor-in-chief Aggrey Klaaste says there are efforts by a cabal in the newsroom to &quot;flog the notion that the management is attempting to turn the Sowetan into an ANC mouthpiece&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is untrue and scandalous. The same people flogging this notion have their own set agendas which include trying to discredit Roger Wellsted,&quot; Klaaste said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Sowetan is seen by some media observers as taking a Pan Africanist Congress and Azanian Peoples Organisation line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A reporter on the Sowetan's political staff says the board was informed of the union's demands, because some reporters in the newsroom felt that Klaaste would not be effective in ensuring that demands are met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Dikgang Moseneke (NAPL director) was personally informed and we expect the board to accede to our demands and get back to us by the middle of next week,&quot; said a Mwasa representative. He said consultations with lawyers were under way and should the board not meet union demands, papers will be filed against board members bringing a court action against members for not following company policy with regards to senior appointments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The union says the possibility of a strike at the newspaper could not be ruled out since &quot;drastic times calls for drastic measures&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another political journalist accused Wellsted of secretly submitting the clippings of political staffers for the scrutiny of Motlana. A letter from Wellsted, in his capacity as the then general manager, addressed to political editor Mathatha Tsedu late last year, states that Motlana &quot;often receives complaints regarding the political bias&quot; of the Sowetan and it is Motlana's &quot;responsibility to evaluate these complaints&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wellsted, in his letter, said the reasons for submitting the files was to present to Motlana a balanced collection of political reports in the hope that he could review them in the light of criticisms received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wellsted stated that he is happy to have noted that neither Klaaste nor Motlana had interfered with the editorial independence of political staffers.  Wellsted apologised to political staffers in the event of having offended any member of staff by not informing them that he had taken files, but added that, since the files are public property, he was well within his right to present the newspaper clippings to Motlana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier this week, Wellsted told the M&amp;G a meeting was held with the political desk and the union in a bid to resolve any disputes. &quot;No one indicated, at the time, that they were unhappy with resolutions reached,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Staffers at the Sowetan are, however, adamant that Wellsted is being manipulated by Motlana. One staffer says TML editors and reporters have to brace themselves for the onslaught by Nail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, not all at the Sowetan believe Motlana is involved. Some say it is the Independent Group which wants the Sowetan to be more ANC-friendly in the hope that both government and ANC will be less vociferous on the issue of media ownership. &quot;The Independent will be happiest if Mbeki and others toned down on the issue of monopolies owning the media.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Editorial independence should not be sacrificed and there is a fear it is slowly being eroded at the Sowetan. It is sad to note that the future of journalism looks bleak if black empowerment is manifesting itself by attempting to control the media,&quot; another staffer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwasa believes the Sowetan's management flouted company policy by not advertising senior posts. Instead, people were merely appointed into senior positions. This, the union says, is totally unacceptable and was the last straw which broke the camel's back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other complaints include Wellsted's attitude to black people who are assertive. &quot;People like Wellsted only want people in senior positions who tow the line of the ANC and that of New Africa's board members. They do not want assertive personnel, but rather people who are easily manipulated,&quot; a senior staffer claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wellsted says the senior appointments were made by board members and were not an individual decision. Klaaste says he will &quot;treat all allegations made by staffers with the contempt it deserves&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Motlana and Moseneke were unavailable for comment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - While most economists are still bullish about the economy, the latest round of surveys by the University of Stellenbosch's Bureau for Economic Research (BER) send out worrying signals about future growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consumer confidence remains relatively buoyant, with many in a &quot;spend-spend-spend&quot; frame of mind; but manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers seem to be worried about whether this mainly credit-driven spending spree can continue much longer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BER said consumer confidence remained high in the first quarter of this year, and more consumers rated the present as the right time to buy durable goods. Slightly more consumers expected their financial position to improve over the next 12 months, but remained hesitant about further improvements in the South African economy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The high level of consumer confidence implies consumers would rather spend the largest part of an increase in income than save it,&quot; BER said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consumer confidence was highest among blacks, although it had fallen off somewhat against the end of 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BER found that business confidence in the retail and wholesale sectors fell in the first quarter despite buoyant sales, which were expected to continue into the second quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said this apparent contradiction was owing to the fact that business confidence was measured both by sales and expectations about the economy and the political situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Business conditions improved in both the wholesale and retail sectors, surpassing expectations even though sales increased at a slower rate than in the fourth quarter of last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Retailers expected business conditions to continue improving in the second quarter, with a smaller increase in semi-durable sales and bigger increases in durable and non-durable sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wholesalers expected business conditions to continue deteriorating in the second quarter, but at a slower rate. However, they still expected a large increase in the volume of sales and orders placed, possibly owing to good summer rainfalls which could lead to a rise in the demand for agricultural machinery and equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prices were expected to start rising more rapidly, mainly for consumer goods, because of higher wage costs and the sharp depreciation of the rand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BER also found that business confidence in the manufacturing sector slumped in the first quarter of this year as sales volumes fell. Expectations for the second quarter remained positive, although they had been adjusted downwards and it was unlikely that the rapid growth in manufacturing value-added in 1995 would be repeated in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bureau said the fall in business confidence from the all-time high in the previous quarter could be an over-reaction, &quot;but a closer look reveals worrying indications&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There had been a &quot;substantial deterioration&quot; in the growth of sales volumes and exports, but a &quot;consoling factor&quot; was expectations of better sales in the second quarter of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BER said the slowdown in demand for manufactured goods could be a temporary phenomenon, but the drop in business confidence made this view tenuous. Although retail and wholesale sales were still buoyant in the first quarter, the fact that manufacturers received lower orders &quot;could suggest that retailers are running down inventories in anticipation of lower sales,&quot; BER said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If manufacturers' expectations of an improvement do not materialise in the second quarter, we may be faced with still lower confidence and the confirmation that the economy is entering a downswing phase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This comes as a somewhat surprising result amid all the optimism of stronger economic growth in 1996.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The government has finally moved to smooth the path of foreign aid, after years of difficulties and frustrations encountered by foreign donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has closed the interdepartmental International Development Co-operation Committee chaired by Elty Links, who has been appointed South Africa's ambassador to the European Union. Instead, all official development assistance now falls under the Department of Finance, which acts as a one- stop point of interaction with donors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This should go some way to improving the interaction with donors and disbursing the monies, as well as data gathering. Finance department figures show that since the government of national unity came to power in 1994, up to the end of the 1995/1996 fiscal year, a total R12,8-billion had been pledged to South Africa. Of this 69% is to the government and parastatals; the rest to non- government and private institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From government's latest survey, in 1994, the biggest donors include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> United States -- $600-million over three years;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Britain -- $1,25-billion, $100-million over three years; the rest being guarantees for export credit;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Japan -- $1,3-billion over two years, $300-million in official development assistance, $500-million in export/import loans and $500-million in government guarantees for commercial loans;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> France -- R3-billion, mainly in concessionary loans and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The European Commission -- 110-million ecus (some R450-million). This still has to be finalised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The R12,8-billion in pledges includes some R2-billion in grant aid (48% earmarked for government), technical assistance of R1,6-billion (58% for government), R1,8-billion in government trade guaranteed loans and R6,5-billion in pledges of concessionary finance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So far, disbursements have been slow. For instance, the grant monies for government go through the Reconstruction and Development Programme Fund. By January about R130-million had been paid out. In addition, about R1-billion has been committed in concessionary loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finance officials are confident this will change rapidly -- monies will flow more smoothly now that agreements have been reached with virtually all the donors. Project agreements are starting to be implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Normalised international relations have shifted the focus of development co-operation with South Africa to enhancing trade, private investment and development loan funding. Grant assistance will be more limited once this initial flurry is spent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus international development financial institutions will gradually replace aid donors in providing concessionary finance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monies mentioned are $1-billion from the World Bank once it finalises South Africa's country assistance strategy, 300-million ecus from the European Investment Bank, $300-million from the African Development Bank, R1,5-billion from the European Investment Bank and $250-million from the Japanese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With this aid projects will also shift to being more value-added as opposed to &quot;soft&quot; projects such as democratisation programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the end, aid and donations are useful for social upliftment, but cannot support long-term economic growth. Only long-term fixed investment can do this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But South Africa is still waiting for foreigners to play a big role in that arena.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - As Cosatu members prepare to picket today, in advance of the first 24-hour national strike called this year, new evidence shows a significant increase in labour unrest in the first quarter. And this is just the beginning; activity is expected to escalate when the rounds of wage bargaining get under way in the second half of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mass action, according to business, could not come at a worse time in light of the rand's performance, and will compound foreign investors' reservations about buying into the South African economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rand's reaction has been relatively muted, although it fell on the stronger dollar on Thursday But there is an obvious cost to the economy in lost production. Ian Robinson, executive director of the Building Industries Federation South Africa, estimated loss in production to the construction industry alone at R200-million for the strike and public holiday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Less easily quantified is the effect on investor confidence. &quot;The massive investment we have been hoping for has not yet occurred,&quot; says Gerrie Bezuidenhout of the South African Chamber of Business. &quot;The prospect of a worsening strike situation must be a factor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the period January to March, a total 175 000 man days were lost to strike activity, against 60 000 in the first quarter of last year, says Andrew Sparks of Andrew Levy &amp; Associates, an industrial relations expert.  Last year, 1,9-million days were lost to strike action, against 3,5-million in 1994 -- and a record 9-million in 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In contrast to last year, strikes have risen in number and size, pointing to a renewed union force. Calling a strike is relatively easy, says Sparks; keeping workers out on strike for several weeks is more difficult, and proof of the unions' strength. Another difference is the background to this year's strike action -- 70% of man days lost are down to grievances; wage-related issues contributed only 0,1%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sparks does not foresee a return to the &quot;bad old days&quot;, but nothing is clear-cut. For its part, Cosatu's Nowetu Mpati could not predict a decline in the number of strikes. &quot;It all depends on the relationship between labour and government, and labour and business. There are still plenty of companies that do not want to address workers' demands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Business is frustrated that further discussions were not held to find a way out of the constitutional impasse. &quot;Cosatu,&quot; says Robinson, &quot;is being obdurate, even resisting discussing the issues at Nedlac. If Nedlac is not the right forum for such talks, what is?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cosatu says it is not striking for &quot;the sake of it&quot;, but will go ahead with the action next week, no matter what.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rights of labour have to be recognised, says Ravi Naidoo of the National Labour and Economic Development Institute, but it is too simplistic to see the issues as pitting capital against labour. &quot;To say the unions are operating an agenda to disrupt the economy is nonsense. The rights of big business are already deeply entrenched; now it's labour's turn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 300 000-strong National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) has pledged its support, as has the National Union of Metalworkers. NUM general secretary Kgalema Motlanthe says it is the &quot;one and only chance to ensure that the lock-out clause is scrapped from the constitution&quot;. Motlanthe says he expects &quot;every self-respecting citizen&quot; to rally in support of the strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is some dissent, however. The Federation of South African Labour Unions (Fedsal) said the vast majority of its members were not in favour of action, although they agreed with the principle that the lock-out clause should not have equal status with the right to strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is talk of a possible trade-off and that the strike call is mere political posturing. Some say Cosatu will score on the lock-out clause, but the property clause will remain in the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the end it may be up to President Nelson Mandela to intervene and reach a compromise. Labour Minister Tito Mboweni is keeping a low profile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cosatu is not easily bought off; should it fail to win this battle, it will call for a referendum, says a representative. An agreement that satisfies business, but does not alienate the workers, will need to be thrashed out before the final constitutional vote on May 8.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Bessie Head's novel Maru is a stark dissection of racial prejudice, all the more compelling for looking at the relationship of black Batswana and the Bushmen. It is not a perfect novel, but there is enough insight, and unexpected writing, to make it memorable. Walter Chakela's adaptation for the stage, now at the Windybrow, has done little to communicate any of these qualities, preserving only the entire stream of the novel's narrative, and leaving one unaffected.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maru is the name of the heir to the chieftainship of Dilepe village, where most of the events occur. He is played by Moagi George Modise as a robust and regal man, rather than as the possibly awkward invalid of the novel. This tends to reduce the interest of the character, to make the power of his dreams over women more incongruous, but it does give greater authority to his dramatic decision to marry one of the &quot;Masarwa&quot;, the Batswana word for the Khoisan people, which has packed in it all the derogatory connotations of &quot;kaffir&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The role of the other central character, Margaret Cadmore, a teacher of Bushman descent, is taken by ex-Miss Zimbabwe Amanda Stally, whose acting doesn't go much beyond fidgeting awkwardly with her fingers and smiling sweetly. One of the awkward points of Head's novel is that the characterisation of this member of the persecuted race is weak; Chakela has done nothing to strengthen it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though the theme of Maru may be racism, the story is that of a love triangle, with Margaret the focal point. The third party in this emotional geometry is Moleka, who is portrayed as a pleasant-enough rake by Thulani Nyembe, but he does not have enough power of personality to make the contest between himself and Maru convincing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dikeledi, lover of Moleka, colleague of Margaret, is played by Nomsa Manaka without much conviction, nor much sense of the unspoken competition between herself and Margaret.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The set design of a few drab walls and doors is dismayingly ugly and claustrophobic, suggesting little of the space and light which fills Maru's imagination and Margaret's painting. If it is meant to represent the meanness of Batswana thought, it is never transcended, though the rather rushed conclusion of the play tells us that bigotry is in the end transformed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chakela's Maru is an ambitious project, not least because of the problems of the book. Unfortunately he has not done enough to take advantage of its strong points, nor enough to make up for the weak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cast play for easy laughs rather than serious impact. This is particularly regretful considering the continuing difficulties of the Khoisan in determining their own destinies. In Maru, they are not quite lost, but will soon be forgotten.<BR>-0</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Last weekend's lush premiere of The Making of a Mahatma -- the first feature film to be co-produced by South Africa and India -- had a distinctly political feel to it. Newly appointed Minister of Trade and Industry Jay Naidoo led the eulogies, praising the co-operation between the private and public sectors that made the film possible; newly appointed businessman Cyril Ramaphosa continued them with his reading of President Nelson Mandela's address, which cited Jans Rautenbach's love-across-the-colour-bar classic, Katrina, as one of South Africa's great cinematic achievements. The whole affair was presided over, in a grandmotherly way, by SABC board member Fatima Meer, on whose book, The Apprenticeship of a Mahatma, the film is based.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Making of a Mahatma tells the story of the young Gandhi, who came to South Africa in 1893, fresh from law school, on a legal brief and ended up staying for 21 years to confront the racism that marked South African life.  It was here that Gandhi first propagated his notion of satyagraha (passive resistance), and the film provides fascinating insights into the politics and polemics that developed his spiritual determination.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The movie also looks at Gandhi's personal life, and his at-times-troubled relationship with his wife, Kasturba. In addition, it paints a broad picture of the Indian community's involvement in the resistance movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is a telegraphed history of incredible detail, cramming a load of incidents into its two-and-a-half hours. And to director Shyam Benegal's credit, the pace never flags, the film never becomes dull. Rajit Kapur is superb in the lead, portraying Gandhi's wilfulness and strength of character, as well as the more gentle and eccentric sides of the man. Equally good is Pallavi Joshi as Kasturba, his long- suffering but supportive wife. The performances are well modulated, and local actors Paul Slabolepszy as Smuts and David Clatworthy as the sympathetic German collaborator Kallenbach are among several who stand out. The film is intimately filmed but conveys a feeling for the period, and the economical use of extras is sufficient to render a sense of the epic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, and here's the rub, this is not really a cinematic experience, but a piece of political sermonising. Part of the problem lies in the screenplay, and particularly the dialogue. It's as if the writers (Meer, in collaboration with Benegal and Indian scripter Shama Zaidi) put ideology and facts into the mouths of the characters; what's worse, when they do come alive, the film plays like a stoic melodrama. The result feels rather like an educational TV mini-series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still, it's a first for this country: a state-financed melodrama of politically correct propaganda. Which explains all the gleaming faces in smart suits at the premiere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week I spoke to director Benegal, and a more charming, intelligent and movie-mad person you couldn't hope to meet. Benegal is a veteran of the new Indian cinema, having made 1000 commercials, over 65 documentaries and more than 25 feature films since 1959. A protege of Satyajit Ray, his works have ranged from the political realms of Ankur (1974), which railed against the caste system, to the deceptively simple melodrama Bhumika (1977), about a Bombay movie queen. He was one of the first directors (along with Martin Scorsese and Shohei Imamura) to be invited to communist China, and was instrumental in getting Zhang Yimou's startling debut feature, Red Sorghum, shown in the West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Benegal was full of praise for his South African cast and crew. The project was initiated by Meer in 1991. (Meer joined the SABC board in 1994, so charges of corruption with regard to the film's financing are misplaced).  The crew was 90% South African -- excluding cinematographer Ashok Mehta (who shot Bandit Queen), the two leads and two small supporting roles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The film was originally budgeted at R4-million, with 60% of the costs covered by the Indian Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, and 40% payed for by the SABC and the ex-House of Delegates. When it went over budget by R400 000, the Indian government came in with half and South Africa's Department of Arts, Science, Culture and Technology with the rest. Still, it's an awesomely small amount to tell an epic story with. Benegal credits the local producers and assistant director with keeping the economics tightly under control and containing the costly time factor in production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from singing the praises of our local artists and artisans, what's Benegal's impression of our industry? He says: &quot;Yours is a virgin land in terms of cinema. The most important thing for South Africa to do is to tap the huge local market. The state should be involved in supporting distribution as well. If they only support production finance, film-makers become too dependent on the state ... You have a crazy system here -- a virtual distribution monopoly with cinemas placed like islands in the suburbs. It's crucial that you create contact with your audience. That's the great advantage of the Indian film industry -- our population demands local product, so American films end up taking only 10% of the market.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Benegal expressed a keen interest in returning to our shores and repeating the fulfilling experience he had on Mahatma, but this time, he says with a wry smile, he'd like to work on a story a little less weighty.<BR>-0</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Tina Turner presents an energetic and polished show, and, observing the enthusiastic and adulatory response of the audience, you can come to only one conclusion: if Nelson Mandela was a woman, he'd be Tina Turner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is just no way to engage objectively with the music and performance of the supreme Granmeister of Rock. The tribulations of the Turner life are well documented, and it would seem uncouth to reward the strength and soul she has so amply displayed with a lukewarm review of her live performance, especially when that performance so obviously revolves around her status as a survivor and a lover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luckily, her show in Cape Town last weekend was of such power and quality that no extreme criticisms are called for. A selection of new songs from her latest album was greeted with bemused respect by the huge crowd, but the more familiar hits, such as Private Dancer, Simply the Best and the hoary Nutbush City Limits, were welcomed with roars of delight and enthusiastic, albeit tuneless, sing-a- longs. Tina was even paid the ultimate compliment by being treated to a bout of what Capetonians loosely term dancing. Rainbow Nation perhaps, but Rhythm Nation never.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The set was stupendous, featuring a vast array of lights and a huge steel circle that opened and closed to reveal the video of the performance.  It looked like a combination of a James Bond gun barrel and some sort of twitching womb, but was certainly impressive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tina's three dancers, Cynthia, Sharon and Karen -- unlike the boys in the band, they don't seem to have surnames -- were excitingly sexy, athletic, and a little pointless. After all, most of the audience clearly seemed to go for older women, and Tina is perfectly capable of entrancing an entire stadium on her own. She proved this by playing a seated set, which you could term &quot;unplugged&quot; if you were willing to risk nasty jokes about life-support systems. This received rapturous applause, and she wasn't begrudged the break, especially since the set included a shatteringly bluesy rendition of Steamy Windows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The quality of the show is owing in no small measure to the skill of the backing band, but it is unquestionably the star quality of Tina that infuses the music with its sexiness and passion. To complement Tina's erotic appeal, and also to heal some of the psychological confusion that many of the screaming adolescents in the front row must have been experiencing at feeling lust for someone older than their mother, there's also some beefcake for the girls. This takes the form -- and what a form it is -- of the saxophonist, a pony-tailed, muscular exhibitionist wearing a skintight white vest and silvery trousers. He has a very large sax indeed, and he received 10 times more applause than the rest of the band.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the funnier notes of the evening was struck when those who paid R350 for the privilege of sitting in the exclusive &quot;Golden Circle&quot;, supposedly above the commoners and with a close-up view of the stage, realised where their seats actually were. To give you an idea, at the preview concert two weeks ago, I was in Row C and could practically reach out and fondle the bits on Tina's legs where the varicose veins are supposed to go.  At the Newlands concert I was in Row A, and could barely make out the huge video screens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another odd moment was when Tina, obviously confused by all the rotting oak trees around Newlands, announced the show as the first of her European tour. But misgivings about senile dementia were forgotten in a night of superb quality rock 'n' roll which could have left few in the ecstatic crowd disappointed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tina Turner performs at the Johannesburg Stadium on Friday and Saturday</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The delicate perfume of freshly cured, silk-textured, golden tobacco leaf wafting from the sprawling tobacco auction floors in Harare is the setting for Zimbabwe's latest race tangle. A bitter black-white war of words and political wheeling and dealing has erupted, with the prize the control of the pickings from the tobacco trade in Zimbabwe that this year is expected to earn US$720-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main protagonist in the struggle is Roger Boka, a short, stocky former small-town insurance salesman who has become the champion of militant black empowerment in Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His campaign is being fought through a long- running series of crudely phrased full-page newspaper advertisements, in which he vilifies whites, and demands government action to drive them out of commanding positions in the economy, and to replace them with blacks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The weed was the engine of the country's rapid post-World War II economic growth, and remains the most important contributor to national GDP.  Zimbabwe is the world's biggest exporter of tobacco and European manufacturers are dependent on the Zimbabwean leaf, whose expertly cultivated aromatic qualities make it indispensable to high-quality international cigarette brands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Solidly connected to the hierarchy of President Robert Mugabe's Zanu(PF) party, Boka claims that 98% of the economy is controlled by &quot;Rhodesian Selous Scouts disguised as economists and accountants&quot; who &quot;killed our brothers and sisters&quot;. The time has come, he says, &quot;to clean our society once and for all&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Boka has himself had links with unsavoury &quot;third force&quot; elements, according to the independent Financial Gazette, which three years ago quoted senior Zimbabwean intelligence officers as saying that Arnoldus van Eck, the self-confessed former Civil Co-operation Bureau agent, worked out of Boka's Harare offices. Van Eck has since admitted acting as a patron for Zimbabwe's black &quot;indigenisation&quot; lobby so he could use it as a conduit for drugs and stolen car rackets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Boka chilled white Zimbabweans' spines earlier this year with an ad picturing a giant python crushing the life out of a crocodile, and the message that this was how whites would be dealt with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Monday this week, the staunchly pro-government Herald, the country's main daily newspaper, refused to carry another Boka ad because of its inflammatory content. The week before, the Financial Gazette said he was &quot;a racist&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the last fortnight his campaign turned its attention to the tobacco industry. Accompanied by bellicose rhetoric, advertisements said he was tendering to buy the entire 1996 tobacco crop of 200-million kg, a move that, if it succeeded, would effectively allow him to hold Europe's cigarette makers to ransom. He also said he was building the world's largest tobacco floor on a 12,5ha site on Harare's outskirts, to challenge the monopoly of the existing floors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then, at the start of the week, he said he had managed to see to it that the Tobacco Marketing Board, the state-appointed body that regulates the trade, refused a new company a buyer's licence because it was run by whites.  Agriculture Minister Denis Norman, the longest-serving white on Mugabe's Cabinet, and who earlier directed that the company be approved, was denounced for having &quot;a hidden agenda which seeks to promote white supremacy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It had Peter Richards, the president of the Zimbabwe Tobacco Association who opened the auction season this week, talking of &quot;disruption&quot; of the industry, and of &quot;mischievous&quot; attempts to unsettle the trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It has done a fair amount of damage,&quot; said marketing executive Brenda Mee. &quot;It is shaking the confidence of our customers that we can continue to supply.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from his advertisement campaign -- which cost him R160 000 in February alone -- Boka maintains a low profile. What is known of him is not pleasant. He threatens business people and journalists, and earlier this year, when a Reuters executive called on him, Boka ordered him out of the office and told him to send a black instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Boka appears to have prodigious influence in high circles. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe allows his merchant bank to operate under much easier conditions than those applying to other banks. Earlier this year, the central bank granted the first licences for the private buying of gold. One went to vice-president Joshua Nkomo's troubled Development Trust of Zimbabwe, and Boka got the other. He has already achieved significant changes to tobacco marketing laws, and is after more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The man is obsessed, but you cannot dismiss him as a loony,&quot; said a Western diplomat. &quot;He has lots of money and lots of influence and is potentially very dangerous. Change the word white in his ads to Jew and you could find the same thing in propaganda leaflets in Nazi Germany.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Journalists who report on confidential parliamentary reports, and the MPs or officials who leak them, are also subject to the same sentences under the Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bill's main intention is to allow MPs immunity from prosecution for comments made in Parliament.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Human rights lawyer Dave Smuts said the clauses in the Bill targeting the press &quot;offend against the freedom of the media enshrined in the Namibian Constitution&quot; and would have a &quot;chilling effect&quot; on parliamentary reporting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He called on Namibia's two houses -- the National Assembly and the National Council -- - to reconsider and omit the provisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Six years after Namibia's independence, the country's print media are worried that the Bill is a signal of growing government intolerance towards the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Namibia's public broadcaster, the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation, has gradually had its editorial independence eroded by the government since independence, but the often critical print media have not faced official sanction until now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attack on the media in the Immunities Bill has left Namibia's newspaper editors seeking unlikely allies in Namibia's house of legislative review, the National Council, of which many members are known for their often conservative views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a recent National Council debate on the Bill, Swapo MP Michael Hishikushitja urged that Parliament be empowered to punish journalists who are found guilty of &quot;contempt of Parliament&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hishikushitja's statement prompted Carol Kotze, editor of The Windhoek Advertiser, to say he was &quot;taking a leaf out of the Zambian book&quot;. Three journalists from the Lusaka-based newspaper The Post were recently sentenced to prison terms after commentaries they wrote were found to be in contempt of Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the Swapo-dominated council does not reject the anti-media clauses, the Bill is likely to go straight to President Sam Nujoma for his assent without amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a letter to National Council members, The Namibian's acting editor, Jean Sutherland, said this week that if the Bill becomes law it will be the &quot;first serious blot&quot; on Namibia's press freedom record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said the Bill was &quot;disturbing&quot; as it sought &quot;to punish journalists for reporting on leaked parliamentary documents, without acknowledging that most in cases leaks are published in the public interest&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Journalists and human rights activists are also concerned that the term &quot;false information&quot; is open to wide interpretation and could be used to punish the media for legitimate comment, interpretation and reports on controversial issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Signs that official tolerance of Namibia's free press is beginning to wane were further underlined by the fact that the Bill was introduced in Parliament by Prime Minister Hage Geingob, widely regarded as a moderate who has previously consulted the media about providing more &quot;open government&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The controversy over the Immunities Bill follows official attacks on the book, Namibia: The Wall of Silence, which deals with Swapo's human rights abuses committed in exile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In response to German priest Siegfried Groth's account of atrocities against Swapo detainees, President Sam Nujoma lambasted the book as &quot;false history&quot; in a television broadcast to the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Swapo secretary general Moses Garoeb went further, declaring war on what he called the &quot;foreign remnants of fascism&quot; backing the book.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last weekend, at an event to mark the 36th anniversary of the formation of Swapo, Garoeb stuck to his theme, saying in an apparent reference to the Groth controversy that there was &quot;a snake threatening Swapo&quot; but that the party was ready to &quot;kill the snake and cut off its head&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former Swapo detainees have called for a South African-style truth commission to open up the issue of atrocities committed before independence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister Pik Botha wants a South African oil field deep in the heart of the old Soviet Union. He told the Mail &amp; Guardian this week he is trying to persuade local oil companies to form a consortium to buy an oil field in Kazakhstan, one of several politically unstable republics deep in the heart of the Commonwealth of Independent States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Botha, who returned from the mineral-rich republic of the former Soviet Union this week, said South African companies had to snap up the opportunities in Kazakhstan before the Americans got there first. He was not daunted by the widespread perception that it is tough doing business in Kazakhstan. Botha believes the country will be politically stable in the long run.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Botha said he would report back to the private sector on the lucrative opportunities which had emerged during his reconaissance mission. &quot;We can't forfeit this kind of money. It is good money. I want to tell South African companies to spread their wings, spread their technology and fly out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it appears he will have a difficult time convincing them. Colin McClelland of the South African Petroleum Industry Association confirmed analysts' suspicions that the local subsidiaries of the major international oil companies would not be interested. That leaves the only two locally owned companies, Engen and Sasol. A spokesman from Energy Africa, Engen's exploration arm, said it was concentrating on Africa. &quot;There is lots of oil all over the world. Resources have to be deployed carefully.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another senior South African oil company official said Kazakhstan was an exceedingly difficult country to work in and that the experienced multi-national oil majors operating there were cautious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to information services group MAID Africa/Profound, foreign businessmen have complained increasingly of corruption, and of the need for backhanders to get things done there. It quotes the Economist Intelligence Unit as saying the trend to greater authoritarianism in Kazakhstan would carry on and opposition groups would continue to be harassed as President Nursultan Nazarbayev consolidated his political power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Caspian Petroleum Consortium's remained unable to reach agreement on which route to build a pipeline to a deep sea port in the the Black Sea continued -- a hurdle which had to be cleared to make an increase in Kazakhstani production worthwhile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Botha said the proposed consortium could include South Africa's state oil company, the Strategic Fuel Fund (SFF), with which South Africa's private sector oil companies have a tetchy relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> McClelland said Botha should take along oil company representatives if he went on such expeditions -- not just state oil company officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former long-serving foreign minister said he had been accompanied by SFF general manager Kobus van Zyl and a representative from the Chamber of Mines on his trip, which had been arranged after an invitation from the Kazakhstani government. Kazakhstan had the 11th-largest oil reserves in the world, and believed new finds could boot it up to number five.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said there was not only great potential for oil companies, but there was considerable scope for local mining companies in Kazakhstan, where mining techniques were primitive. &quot;It would be a picnic for our gold mining companies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Botha said he was also exploring the possibility of securing credit lines for South African exports to Iran, using the Iranian crude oil South Africa imports as collateral. Iran, which has a US ban on its oil, is South Africa's main supplier of oil.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - South Africa has again refused to support an outright ban on landmines, in defiance of the wishes of Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Foreign Affairs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This week South Africa went to the Review Conference on the United Nations Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW) with a position virtually unchanged since the original review conference last year, which called for a further conference after a failure to reach consensus. The position taken to both conferences is that CCW should allow the continued manufacture of &quot;smart mines&quot;, mines which self-destruct after a set period of time, and that armies should phase in the use of &quot;smart mines&quot; to replace existing stocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Supporters of &quot;smart mines&quot; argue that they fulfill the defence function of conventional mines without the long-term risk to civilians. Opponents argue that &quot;smart mines&quot; are equally capable of maiming civilians.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following last year's conference, the Portfolio Committee on Foreign Affairs decided in favour of implementing a ban on the production, use and transfer of all types of anti-personnel mines -- a position which was overridden by the Department of Foreign Affairs when it took its position favouring &quot;smart mines&quot; to Geneva this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A representative of the Department of Foreign Affairs said South Africa's position at the conference must not be seen as reflecting the government's principled position on landmines. The government's concern was to unite countries behind the convention, and for this reason the convention had to be one which would be acceptable to most governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, more and more countries are calling for an outright ban on all kinds of anti- personnel mines. Germany, Canada and Australia are the most recent countries to add their voices to the anti-mine campaign, bringing to 29 the total number of countries supporting this position. Mozambique, heavily mined during more than 20 years of civil war, also supports a total ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Foreign Affairs, the South African position is not immutable, and could yet change by the time the review conference ends next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cabinet is still divided on the issue. As recently as the beginning of April, indications were that cabinet would support an outright ban, but this position had changed by the time the delegation went to Geneva.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The International Campaign to Ban Landmines has flown people who lost limbs in landmine explosions to be present at the conference, to remind delegates of the human cost of landmines.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - United Democratic Front (UDF) activists, who bore the brunt of the state's iron fist in the Western Cape, did not show up at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's hearings in Cape Town this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Resistance to testifying at the TRC was particularly high in the Cape, where many victims and their relatives expressed misgivings about the process. But their absence could give the public a skewed idea of the extent of human rights violations perpetrated against opponents of apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UDF and former Umkhonto weSizwe operatives had in the 1980s claimed on numerous occasions, including at court hearings, that security police had shot them and tortured them during detention.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former UDF leader, Johnny Issel, now a member of the Western Cape Provincial Legislature, said this week he saw no purpose in testifying at the TRC. He had been detained and tortured on numerous occasions in the 1970s and 1980s and was banned. In 1989 he brought an application to the supreme court in an attempt to stop police harassment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an affidavit he described his fears that the police would &quot;shoot to kill&quot; him. &quot;I was confronted by a member of the security forces at the home of my wife's parents. He took out his gun and wanted to shoot me, but my wife came between us and prevented him from shooting me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If my wife had not prevented him, I could have been killed or seriously injured.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also described an incident in February 1989 where 50 policemen wearing balaclavas arrived at a party he was attending. He hid in bushes and overheard one policeman shout to another that he would kill him if he spotted him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Issel said he still believed today that the police meant to murder him.  &quot;They told me they were going to kill me and they made numerous attempts to do so. It was premeditated and planned. Thank God I'm a survivor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Issel said he had been tortured by several security policemen, including some whose names have already come up at TRC hearings. He also named others who had not only tortured him, but members of his family as well. Yet, he is not prepared to share this with the TRC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't think I'll get lasting peace if I go to the truth commission and give them my story. All I will be doing is giving them more time on television,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other victims of security policemen who were members of what was called the Terrorist Detection Unit in the Western Cape also claimed this week that they had been tortured. They also said they would not testify at the TRC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the 1980s, the Terrorist Detection Unit detained scores of people and produced two major terrorism trials. Both trials started after people were held for months in solitary confinement, and in both instances, trialists told the courts how they had been tortured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In one case known as the Yengeni trial (MP Tony Yengeni was accused number one), trialists initiated steps to have a security policeman prosecuted abroad for crimes against humanity and torture. They claimed they were beaten, chained, suffocated and shocked at the security police's offices in Culemborg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the trialists, who asked not to be named, said this week he believed there was a &quot;culture of silence and self-denial&quot; in the Western Cape. He had not considered testifying to the TRC about his experiences in detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is going to sound strange, but it's something we just don't talk about. If any of the people who had undergone torture speaks out, it's almost as though others believe they are bragging, that they believe they had been stronger or tougher than the rest,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I agree someone needs to break that culture of silence if the TRC is to hear the full story of the atrocities committed in the Western Cape, but it's not going to be me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another former UDF member who claimed she had been tortured by the security police said she would not testify at the truth commission as it was nothing more than a &quot;church service&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I was at the truth commission's public meeting in Cape Town last week and it was pathetic. They had people singing Senzenina (What have we done?).  We know what we did, we opposed apartheid, a crime against humanity,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'We told our stories before, there were court cases, there was media exposure, there were international campaigns. People know what atrocities were committed. Why must we now come again and sit in front of television cameras so everyone can see us cry? I'm not a victim, I'm a survivor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Why must we reconcile? If a murder was committed, justice must take its course in the courts of law. The TRC can't stop that from happening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The family of one of the most respected leaders to emerge from the Muslim community in Cape Town, Imam Abdullah Haron, has not yet decided whether to testify before the TRC. Haron died in detention in 1969 after being held by security police at the Caledon Square police station. Police said he had fallen down a flight of stairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite a personal appeal from TRC commissioner Mary Burton and a visit to President Nelson Mandela last week, the Haron family attended the hearings as observers, not participants. They want Haron's killers to be brought to justice in a court of law and are reluctant to offer them an opportunity to apply to the TRC for amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TRC representative John Allen said in response that the process was completely voluntary and although an attempt was made to make the hearings as representative as possible of all cases, it was not always possible to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The commission appealed generally for people to come forward, we are making no distinction between high-profile and lower-profile cases,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - A curious picture began to emerge this week of Ian Woodall, the mountaineer who was to have led a South African expedition to glory on the summit of Mount Everest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Sunday Times this week withdrew its sponsorship of the expedition after clashes at the Everest base camp during which Woodall reportedly threatened to kill the newspaper's editor, Ken Owen, and his wife, Kate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Woodall said he was forging ahead with the assault on the Everest summit. Speaking by satellite telephone the expedition leader said he was preparing for the final ascent. His team is now made up of British photographer Bruce Herod and the daughter of a director of the Anglo American Corporation, Cathy O'Dowd.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Woodall's 69-year-old father, who was bidding to become the oldest man to climb Everest, appears to have dropped out. Woodall said he was negotiating with the Nepalese authorities to get a second woman, Deshun Deysel, onto the climbing permit. Critics of the expedition have described Deysel as an affirmative-action choice for the team. Her previous mountaineering experience is limited to a hike up Mount Kilimanjaro and there are fears for her safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Johannesburg the Sunday Times editor-designate, Brian Pottinger, said that before agreeing to back the expedition they had checked Woodall's background, confirming that he graduated from Bishop's school in Cape Town and had served in the South African Defence Force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Further investigations by the Mail &amp; Guardian suggest if they had dug deeper the newspaper would have been less enthusiastic about the project -- led, as it was, by a man with an unimpressive managerial reputation as well dubious qualifications as a climber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Veteran Cape climber Geoff Ward said Woodall had worked for him as a sales assistant at Camp and Climb in Cape Town in 1976. In the early 1990s Woodall had applied for a job with the top British outdoors firm, Cotswold Camping, claiming he had been the general manager of Camp and Climb. &quot;He never got the Cotswold job,&quot; said Ward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Ward, Woodall left Camp and Climb in the Seventies to open his own outdoors shops, in Stellenbosch and Cape Town. Both closed after Woodall had apparently failed to keep regular hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Woodall has also been described as an &quot;officer commanding an elite British mountain reconnaissance unit&quot;. Ward said: &quot;I have discussed this with British mountaineers and they say there is no such thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ward said he had climbed the middle-grade, big-wall Cape route, Lucifer, with Woodall in the Seventies and found him to be a climber of only &quot;moderate&quot; abilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I led all the hard pitches on Lucifer, and now I understand he has been talking about being a leading ice climber. This is highly unlikely, as nobody seems to have climbed with him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ward's description of Woodall's abilities ties in with accounts by two veteran climbers who withdrew from the expedition at the foot of Everest -- Andrew Hackland and South Africa's top black mountaineer, Ed February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hackland said the problems started when they gathered in Johannesburg, before flying out to the Himalayas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We were told that everything was being organised and would be there in Johannesburg. But when we got there -- nothing,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the equipment did arrive &quot;everything promised turned out to be something different. The Goretex gear from Berghaus later turned out to be coming from Cape Union Mart. They don't make Goretex so the stuff had to be ordered from somewhere else at great expense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South African climbers were also startled when they touched down at Katmandu Airport and saw Woodall produce a British passport at immigration.  Another member of the expedition, Andrew de Klerk -- who enjoys dual US-South African citizenship -- had previously been warned by Woodall that he would only be allowed on the team if he travelled on his South African passport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ken Owen reported at the weekend how Woodall flew into a rage when he challenged him about his nationality. Woodall said he had fought on the Angolan border for the South African Defence Force to save the skins of &quot;arseholes&quot; like Owen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> February and Hackland recalled how the team then got to within two hours of the base of Everest only to be withdrawn to a position two days away from the peak. &quot;There was no point being at base camp,&quot; said February. &quot;There was no gear there for us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> February described how he was making a preliminary climb, hiking up the 5 500m-high Kalar Patar peak, when he saw Woodall -- who had only been at altitude for four days -- striding out up the path towards him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I thought 'He hasn't acclimatised, he must be mad.' Then I saw the guy had nothing with him. No rucksack, no water, no food. This is completely basic -- I wouldn't even walk up Table Mountain without these things. I felt that he was trying to compete with me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soon afterwards Woodall &quot;stopped, sat down and started puking&quot; and appears never to have made it to the top of Kalar Patar peak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It was Woodall's expedition which we put our name to,&quot; said Pottinger this week, shortly before his announcement that the Sunday Times was pulling out. &quot;But things have happened since which have made it impossible to lend our name to it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Management at Times Media Limited, which owns the Sunday Times, this week refused to disclose how much money it had pumped into the expedition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - KwaZulu-Natal human rights groups delivered a stiff blow this week to the African National Congress's bid to stall local government elections in the province, warning a postponement would escalate tensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a submission tabled to the task group investigating the feasibility of the May 29 poll date, the Human Rights Advocacy Forum warned that: &quot;The postponement of the elections may well lead to an escalation of violence and create further issues of conflict ... and may allow for militants to further undermine the political turbulence in the province.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The forum includes the Network of Independent Monitors, Lawyers for Human Rights, the Human Rights Commission and the Independent Medical- Legal Unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The forum said continuing political violence and a lack of free political activity raised serious questions about whether the elections can be free and fair in a number of areas and linked an &quot;increased militarisation&quot; in the province in the past four months to the poll, but warned that a postponement would &quot;not necessarily ensure a better security situation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The forum called for effective investigations into acts of political violence and assassination of candidates, an independent monitoring structure to evaluate and report on the process, and advised that urgent attention be paid to questions of fraud and voter registration.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The Human Rights Committee has asked the Constitutional Court to allow members of the public to appear before it to give their views on the final Constitution, on grounds that much of what has emerged has come out of closed political party negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Constitutional Court has set aside the month of June to deal with certifying the final Constitution. It is understood that political parties will be allowed to make submissions as the court considers whether or not the text complies with the 34 principles enshrined in the interim Constitution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Human Rights Committee national chairperson Professor Jeremy Sarkin said it was not enough to allow only politicians to address the court. While the Constitutional Assembly had been inundated by public submissions, the amount of influence they had had on the process was open to question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Did people who made submissions really make a difference in terms of what the Constitution looks like? When you look at the final draft, it looks like a politicians' document. Was the submission process consultation in theory, or did it allow for consultation in practice?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An evaluation of the public participation, media, education and plain language campaigns of the Constitutional Assembly carried out in February found that people were more likely to have heard about the Constitution and felt part of the process if they were younger, educated and lived in a town or city than if they were poorly educated, lived in a rural area or were female.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conducted by the Community Agency for Social Enquiry (Case), the survey sampled 3800 South Africans soon after the draft Constitution was released.  Eight percent, or two million adults, had already seen it, while 82%, or 21 million adults, wanted to know more about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Case has argued strongly that the education campaign not be halted but be intensified when the final Constitution is launched.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Exhausted constitutional negotiators kept smiling -- sometimes grimly -- this week, saying they were on track to meet the May 8 deadline for the adoption of the final Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the happy faces barely concealed the reality that the African National Congress and the National Party have finally reached the point of no more compromise on two emotionally-charged issues: single-language schools, and the right of employers to lock out striking workers. Property and language rights have also still to be resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Multilateral talks between the parties continued, with the possibility that parties would submit negotiated amendments, rather than single-party proposals, to save time. While there was speculation that trade-offs could break the logjam, none of the parties was saying so for fear of losing a bargaining position.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in a week largely occupied with technicalities and the consolidation of progress made in previous weeks, neither party budged over education and the lock-out, and no more than lip-service was paid to the &quot;spirit of give and take&quot; which has been heralded as the secret ingredient of the progress made in recent months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the ANC, the NP demands for the lock-out and single-language schools resonate with the bitter struggles around labour and education in the Seventies and Eighties. For the NP the demands meet an obligation to two crucial constituencies: business, and conservative Afrikanerdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC negotiator Blade Nzimande sounded despondent about progress on the education clause. &quot;There has been no progress on this issue in the last six months,&quot; he said. The solution to the issue would be a formulation of the clause which will allow for the existence of some Afrikaans schools while giving the ANC the guarantee that such schools would not be racially exclusive, yet such a formulation has so far proved elusive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NP's Peter Marais said he was &quot;hopeful&quot; about the resolution of the education issue and that it was &quot;a difficult one, because of its emotional content&quot;. The Democratic Party has proposed a model which would give a maximum amount of control to the parent body in the running of schools, while maintaining constitutional guarantees against racial exclusivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cosatu representatives were meeting with NP negotiators on Thursday over the lock-out clause. Cosatu and the ANC are standing firm on permitting a compromise in legislation, but not in the Constitution; the NP is resolute it wants constitutional guarantees on the lock- out, education and language issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC negotiators stuck to the position that the right of businesses to lock out striking workers is not one which is normally entrenched in a Constitution. They are also hopeful that while the NP's position on the lock-out will please the business constituency, it will alienate another important part of the NP support base, the coloured working class, only weeks before the municipal elections in the Western Cape, and that this could cause the NP to buckle on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a meeting of the Constitutional Assembly's management committee on Thursday it was decided a flexible approach would apply to tabling amendments. Constitutional Assembly representative Katherine McKenzie said while the deadline was set for noon on Thursday, more amendments were expected the next day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the first reading of the Constitution Bill approved in the full Constitutional Assembly on Wednesday night, the Constitutional Committee was set to start considering amendments at 2pm Thursday and would continue from 9am Friday. Another meeting was scheduled for Monday, McKenzie said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From Tuesday, technical advisers working with the various parties would work on refining the Bill, which would be tabled before a full sitting of the Constitutional Assembly on May 6. Any changes could be dealt with in committee, she said. The deadline of May 8 for the adoption of the Constitution still stood, she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Chairperson of the Non-governmental Organisation Co-ordinating Commitee (NGO-CC) Susan Jere today resigned as chairperson of NGOCC to join the Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) led by Dean Mung'omba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at a press conference here, Mrs Jere said that she has decided to join politics to help shape up the destiny of Zambia which needed the perspectives, skills, ideas and knowledge of determined women and men.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said that her vision is to channel the women's voting power into a vehicle for changing the women's deplorable condition. She was also responding to the repeated calls for capable and concerned women to come forward and participate actively in the development of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs Jere said that although NGOs have been petitioning successive governments in Zambia to end discrimination,exploitation and marginalisation of women for the benefit of the country,the pleas and petitions have fallen on insensitive ears and that the plight of women has continued to be pathetic and has also not been improved at all by the democratisation process ushered in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She made no apologies for moving from the NGO's world into politics as anyone was free to move from one sector to another. She was proud that she had found a party that has an affirmative policy for all levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The vice president of internationaal relations of Zadeco Dr Kasuka Mutukwa welcomed Mrs Jere and extended an invitation to other women and men of substance and capacity to join the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Mutukwa said ZADECO is expecting to adopt more women candidates in the 1996 national elecions than any other party adding that Zadeco does not expect UNIP and MMD to do any better as they have continued to marginalise the women.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAZ Chairman, George Kunda, has also said that it is still not too late for government to provide for a constituent assembly as the only means of adopting the proposed constitutional amendments on consensus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Kunda said in a stament today the constitution amendment bill in its present format has some unacceptable clauses on important issues including the independence of the judiciary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said LAZ has not seen any form of commitment from government to withdraw the clause on the autonomy of the judiciary despite President Chiluba making an affirmation that such clauses would not be introduced in the draft constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the annual dinner for LAZ last monthend, Mr Chiluba assured the association that government would not introduce clauses that undermine the independence of the judiciary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Kunda maintained that his association wants the clause to be removed because it is cognizant of the fact that an autonomous independent judiciary is essential in a democratic society like Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said LAZ wishes to make its stand known that should government go ahead and include the contentious clause the association will use the existing law and fight to ensure that the provisions are scrapped from the state books.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Agriculture, Food and Fisheries Minister, Suresh Desai, today said that the government will this season purchase crops worth k10 billion mostly from rural areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Desai told a press briefing here today that the K10 billion would be released by the budget office in good time through the food reserve agency which is aready operational so that crops are not spoiled.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said farmers who obtained fertilizers on loan from government stockists under the agricultural credit management programme (ACMP) will be allowed to pay back with maize or other produce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The total amount due to be recovered from farmers for fertilizer loans under this programme is about K30 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Desai said that apart from the government assisted marketing arrangements, a significant proportion of the total crop will be bought and sold by small scale traders at public markets and by large scale traders who are generating export orders in foreign countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''In selling their produce, farmers are reminded to hold back enough for their own household food security and sell only what is surplus to their requirement,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the ministry has already held discussions with local truckers who have indicated both capacity and willingness to handle the haulage of this years' crop and that government has decided to accord priority to the grading and repair of roads important to the crop marketing and haulage exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Desai said that the national early warning unit in his ministry has forecast a preliminary crop yield of 16,500,000 x 90 kilogrammes bags of maize, 386,200 x 90 kilogrammes bags of sorghum and 573,460 x 90 kilogrammes bags of millet.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Government has said the appraisal of its past perfomance in crop marketing has resulted in the development of the inventory credit scheme so that the past mistakes and problems are avoided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing a press briefing in his office here today, Agriculture, Food and Fisheries Minister, Suresh Desai, said government has now found it better to put up a policy to be called the inventory credit scheme aimed at eliminating all problems the crop marketing system faced in the past.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Desai said the scheme would create a more efficient and problem free crop marketing system which could grow to accumulate sufficient credibility and confidence to attract large scale private sector funding into crop storage and marketing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He regreted at the same time that in the past two years, the government made funds available to the private sector dealers through the marketing credit revolving fund but its operational modalities were prone to bureaucratic delays, mischanneling of funds and difficulties in effecting repayments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Desai explained that the inventory credit scheme fund which will be managed by a professional fund manager, supported by one warehouse manager in each of the six marketing zones through out the country, will be able to recover its loans with interest when the trader sells the crop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The crops that will be eligible for funding under this scheme will be maize, sorghum, millet, sunflower, groundnuts and beans and an initial injection of k12 billion from government has already been set aside for the scheme.</SPAN></P>

According to Emily, the first step to empowering women is to ensure that they have the freedom to discuss, share and, ultimately, gain control over their lives. &quot;Empowerment can only begin with participation,&quot; she says. &quot;Through which the women gain commitment, mature understanding and confidence in themselves.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So far, her organisation has assisted women in the Gwembe valley and Magoye East in Southern Province, Sichili and Senanga East in Western Province and Mumbwa in Central Province. &quot;Our field workers live in these areas for three out of four weeks so that they know the communities well,&quot; she claims. &quot;They listen to the communities, understand their problems and assist them to find solutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But unfortunately her work has been misconstrued by certain people, especially politicians who see it as the work of a frustrated woman whose only aim is &quot;to confuse the womenfolk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But she is unruffled. &quot;I have always questioned injustice from the time I was a child,&quot; she explains, &quot;I never grew up in a family where girls were treated as second class citizens and that did a lot to shape my character.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Emily attributes her philanthropic character to her late grandfather.  &quot;My grandfather was a very just man. He used to insist that his workers were fed first before his family ate,&quot; she claims, adding that when his fishing boats returned &quot;he would give the catch from the first boat to the orphans, the aged and widows&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But why is she so carried away with women's rights? &quot;Women constitute 51 per cent of our population. You don't expect them to be spectators in the development of society,&quot; she says, adding: &quot;Women do 80 per cent of the work yet its the men who enjoy the rewards. For me, it is a challenge to remove this injustice. There is no way we can continue with a system that uses women as beasts of burden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She gets upset when people (read politicians) trivialise the gender issue. &quot;There is nothing romantic about gender issues, it's about life,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Emily attributes her fighting spirit to her mother who was related to the late Malawian politician, Dunduza Chisiza. &quot;My mother used to be detained for being related to Dunduza and I spent numerous occasions in prison with her,&quot; she claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She continued living with and seeing victimisation at various levels of society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When she joined the Lint Company of Zambia (LINTCO), as an agronomist, she was never accepted, she says, &quot;because I was a woman&quot;. &quot;I had a Masters degree but they made it a point that I was oppressed,&quot; she says. &quot;This is why I will never stop to challenge conventional attitudes and beliefs that inhibit women's full participation in the development of society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Little wonder, in 1991 she was recommended for early retirement. &quot;I wasn't suprised. I expected it because I used to speak my mind,&quot; she says.  &quot;In 1987 I made management release all the women so that we could participate in the International Day for Women. It was the first time that such a thing had ever happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After LINTCO, she joined Care International on contract. &quot;I helped with identification of projects in rural areas, such as the rehabilitation of water wells and dams in the Southern Province,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1992, she saw an advertisement in one of the local newspapers for the position of executive director at the Women for Change. She quickly applied for the post. As executive director, she is responsible for the day to day running of the organisation. &quot;I do a lot of fund raising, network with government ministries and other NGO's within Zambia and the region. I source and compile information for building awareness of gender, women's and participatory education issues,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the general belief about her activities, 42-year-old Emily refuses to be categorised as a feminist. &quot;I just believe in gender equality.  Infact, that's what keeps me fueled up,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She adds that her belief in social justice is what gives her the energy to forge ahead. &quot;When people talk about human rights they are talking about social justice,&quot; she says. &quot;A wrong is a wrong, be it gender, sustainable development, politics or economic policies. I have got a certain vision and I think that vision is what gives me energy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Emily believes there is no excuse for denying rural communities basic needs on the pretext that &quot;government has got no money&quot;. &quot;They don't need government's money. Create an enabling environment in the rural areas. Build good roads, schools, hospitals and give them clean tapped water and they will survive,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But who is Emily Sikazwe? &quot;I am simply an independent woman who knows her rights,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And you know why she ticks? She says &quot;I can walk into a bar and sit at the counter without batting an eye lid.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Columbia - A series of short videos showing eight different environmental projects in Africa is now available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa's wild lands, pristine coasts and coral islands can only be preserved by Africans. The video &quot;Tanzanian Features,&quot; gives hope the continent's greatest ecological treasures can be saved. It tells of the speed and magnitude of the destruction of the continent's wild lands, which are often spiritual homelands to Africa's people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When wild lands were made into national parks, governments would often forcibly remove whole villages from the newly created national park lands, breeding bitterness and dispossessed poachers. The video shows the efforts by the World Wildlife Federation and African governments to constructively involve the people in conservation and profitable businesses based on renewable resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the creation of Nyka National Park in Malawi, thousands of indigenous people were forcible resettled. At first the only local people who profited from the national park were poachers. But bee-keeping had always been an important traditional economic activity before the land was made into a national park. The WWF and the Malawi government allowed people living around the park to re-establish bee-keeping. With the introduction of appropriate very accessible technology honey and bee's wax have become cash crops which have produced prosperity for many local people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Madagascar important life-saving medicines have been derived from the land's abundant and diverse flora. But only the international pharmaceutical companies have profited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A WWF project is providing training in western pharmacology as well as indigenous herbalogy. The intent of the project is to create a local pharmacological industry, and to create a clinic where local herbalists and western trained scientists will work together to develop drugs for international markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The growing population of Africa continues to press on the continent's last wild lands and pristine coastal resources. These ecological treasures can be saved if Africans can use these places' renewable resources and are able to once again find their way to their spiritual homelands.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Elections Office is ready to allow the use of transparent ballot boxes in the forthcoming parliamentary and presidential elections as long as funds to purchase them are made available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Director, Rabson Mwansa, says in Lusaka today that there was nothing difficult about using transparent ballot boxes because other countries such as France do use them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that the whole process would be made possible if funds to buy the 10,000 ballot boxes needed for all polling districts are available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''If someone gives us the funds to buy the 10,000 ballot boxes needed for all the polling districts, we would definately allow the use of the transparent ballot boxes,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Mwansa's remarks come in the wake of calls by the Zambia Democratic Congress who say that they would campaign for the use of transparent ballot boxes in the forthcoming general elections so that frauds and other malpractices are minimised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZDC believes that the use of transparent boxes would tramendously reduce tension which exist when the ballot boxes are being transfered from one place to another.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Despite the heavy rains last year, Zambia will record a 10 per cent shortfall on it's energy reqeuirements this year, Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO) director of generation and transimission, John Wright, has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Wright, Zambia needs a total energy supply of 7,825 mega watts but the energy situation forecast for the same period shows that only 7,091 mega watts of electricity would be harnessed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This shortfall represents 100 mega watts of energy, which is equivalent to the Victoria Falls, hydro electricity operations,&quot; Wright said. &quot;The only way of dealing with this deficit is by energy conservation, importation of energy from Zaire and optimising water management.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other measures include improving efficiency and introducing a quota system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In order to manage conservation, we would need to correct the power factor, switch off unnecessary loads and encourage off-peak operation,&quot; Wright advised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, ZESCO managing director Robson Mwansa has conceded that his company is inefficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwansa was responding to a complaint by a consumer, Alfred Mushinga, during a tariff symposium which was held at Lusaka's hotel intercontinental yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Yes ZESCO is inefficient. The fact that we have a $3 billion investment and only manage a $100 million turn over annualy which means we are inefficient,&quot; Mwansa said, adding: &quot;We are not where we should be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he assured the participants that management was working out ways to change this position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is need to change the attitude of our workers. There is definitely need for complete change of mind set,&quot; Mwansa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And distribution and customer relations director Griver Sikasote said the new tarrifs which are being advertised will be effected on May 16, and will remain the lowest in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said over 80 per cent of ZESCO's operations are foreign driven, and for ZESCO to survive the high inflation rate at 63 per cent, it has to increase its tarrifs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are very conscious of the way we move our tarrifs, we want to increase, and improve on the service we provide,&quot; Sikasote said, adding, &quot;the current tarrifs are very subeconomic, and cannot sustain ZESCO as a viable company.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Visiting programmes co-ordinator Lars Haue- Pedersen, who is in the country to inspect the proposed centre, said he was happy with the existing infrastructure but is yet to present his report to his bosses in Switzerland for approval.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Stories of violence against women and child abuse in this country are unending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What is most worrying, as the judges observed yesterday, is that violence against women, despite efforts to address it, has continued to be on the increase in most parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this scourge must not be viewed in isolation from other crimes in the country. There are so many factors influencing abuses against humanity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Crimes are occurring as a result of archaic beliefs and practices, poverty, mental complexes, drug addiction or other reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We should therefore have no illusions about easy solutions to this problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What we are dealing with are attitudes, and traditional values which have variant histories and which require a lot of effort to reverse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The women folk may have been abused more due to several considerations including physical strength.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This one fact underlines the need for society to be sensitive to the plight of women. Not because they are lesser human beings but that realism demands that we be conscious of the physical abilities of both man and woman.  After all most abuses have involved physical violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Legislation and its correct implementation is vital as the judges who constituted the panel at yesterday's women tribunal observed but this alone will not help. Increased awareness on the subject targeted at attitude change will be a bigger benefit than penal action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is important to recognise that such awareness needs the right target groups. The worst perpetrators of such violations may not always be the few that sit in hotel seminars on Women on violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly we need to recognise that the most effective way of fighting this is also to engage in active work that helps reverse our economic malaise. We need to accept that economic and social progress in our country is tied to correct political policies and thinking. We should therefore not be pathetic to governance issues surrounding us. All these problems are interrelated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The government may be bowing to donor and local pressure over some clauses in the new constitution and may allow former President Kenneth Kaunda to contest this year's presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Diplomatic sources revealed in Lusaka last week that the donor community has received firm government assurances that Kaunda would not be barred from contesting this year's elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sources said however that government may retain the citizenship clause in the constitution but it will not be effective until after this year's general elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have been assured by the government that the former president will not be barred,&quot; the diplomatic sources said. &quot;They have insisted the parental clause will be passed but will not be effective until after the elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Chiluba told the annual general meeting of the Evangelical Fellowship of Zambia that his government has had to give in to donor pressure before being granted financial aid because &quot;donor aid is not free&quot; and has &quot;strings attached&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Those who give this support also demand something in return and we see them start influencing our political livelihood,&quot; the president said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And chief government spokesman Amusaa Mwanamwamba suggested last week that Kaunda would not be barred from contesting the elections &quot;so long he satisfied minimum qualification requirements for his candidacy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in an interview yesterday Mwanamwambwa described the news of government assurances as unfounded rumours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I as government spokesman I am unaware about that and it is a surprise to me, who is circulating such rumours even before parliament resumes sitting because everything will be resolved by parliament,&quot; Mwanamwambwa said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - A panel of four judges and a state counsel were yesterday shocked at the high level of violence against women and child abuse in the country after hearing testimonies from some of the victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judges Bobby Bwalya, Sandston Silomba, Peter Chitengi, Florence Lengalenga and lawyer Edward Shamwana, sitting as a second tribunal organised by the Young Women's Christian Association also attributed violence against women to a corrupt police force.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They endorsed the recommendations by the first tribunal of 1993 on the need to address violence against women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reading the verdict after hearing the moving testimonies of five women, including a 14-year-old girl who underwent different ordeals, Judge Bwalya said the situation had not changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He attributed the mistreatment of women and children to ignorance among the members of the society who failed to report such incidents and in certain cases failed to exhaust the judicial processes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;From the five testimonies we have so far heard, it is clear that the situation on violence on women and child abuse hasn't changed much&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judge Bwalya cited the other reasons for the continued women abuse to downright corruption in the manner the cases were handled by the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The pannel also observed that most local court justices were mishandling cases women violence by failing to deal with them conclusively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He challenged women and people in general to end the practice by educating society and further urged individuals to take up such cases to courts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, D.C. - The following letter was sent by the International Human Rights Law Group, a Washington, DC -based human rights organization, to President Jimmy Carter on April 19, 1996.<BR> I understand that you are currently considering the possibility of holding the third summit meeting of the heads of state of the Great Lakes region in Atlanta this May. While the International Human Rights Law Group greatly appreciates your efforts to promote reconciliation in the Great Lakes region, we believe that inviting President Mobutu Sese Seko to the United States at this time would be inappropriate given his continued efforts to obstruct the transition to democracy in Zaire. I urge you, therefore, to consider alternatives to his physical presence at the Atlanta meeting. I understand, for example, that because of elections in Uganda, President Museveni may participate in the summit by teleconference. I would encourage you to consider a similar arrangement for President Mobutu.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As you know, President Mobutu is barred from obtaining a U.S. visa under the terms of a Presidential proclamation of June 23, 1993, which directs the Secretary of State to deny a visa to anyone obstructing the democratic transition in Zaire. The visa sanction unambiguously expresses US disapproval of President Mobutu's continuing efforts to undermine Zairian democratization and remains the only effective measure applied by the United States that specifically targets the President and his entourage without punishing the Zairian people at large. The sanction is widely supported by Zairian human rights organizations and other civil society groups. Relaxing the visa sanction now would only convey US acquiescence to President Mobutu's continuing obstructionism at a time when upcoming Zairian elections demand an unambiguous US stance.<BR> Your joint declaration with President Mobutu at Faro last September addressed our concerns that President Mobutu would manipulate efforts to promote regional reconciliation in order to end his international isolation while continuing to bloc meaningful democratic transition within Zaire.  President Mobutu, however, has not respected these minimum commitments that he made at Faro, nor has he honored his broader obligations under the Zairian Constitutional Act of the Transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Law Group's greatest concern is that President Mobutu has not taken meaningful steps to ensure the neutrality of the Zairian security forces, despite his commitment to do &quot;everything possible to ensure confidence in the election procedures and results.&quot; Neutrality of the security forces is widely regarded as an essential pre-condition to successful elections. President Mobutu has instead tightened his control over the security forces and used them to intimidate individuals and groups working to promote popular participation in the electoral process. For example:<BR> * On November 14, 1995, soldiers from SARM, the military intelligence service, arrested Mr. Kabila Kakule for having translated the official documents of the Sovereign National Conference, including the draft constitution, into Zaire's four national languages at the request of the High Council of the Republic/Parliament- in-Transition. SARM confiscated all copies of the translations and detained Mr.  Kakule for six weeks.<BR> * On November 21, 1995, soldiers from SARM arrested Mr. Batabiha Bushoki, the President of a local human rights organization in Goma, because he greeted and hoped to meet with you during your visit to Goma. Ignoring orders from the Regional Governor and the Minister of External Relations to release Bushoki, SARM officers continued to detain Mr.Bushoki until President Mobutu personally interceded nine days later.<BR> * Rather than submit to the authority of the civilian government as required by the transition constitution, the Civil Guards have increasingly linked their activities to SNIP, the national intelligence service.  Consequently, they remain unaccountable to anyone except President Mobutu himself.<BR> President Mobutu made an additional commitment at Faro to thoroughly investigate the violent repression of a peaceful PALU (Unified Lumumbist Party) demonstration by the security forces on July 29, 1995. He also promised to pursue appropriate legal action against those responsible. The Voix des Sans Voix (Voice of the Voiceless), a Zairian human rights group, confirms that to date there has been no official inquiry nor has any legal action been initiated. Meanwhile, PALU officials filed suit against the authorities several months ago, but are still awaiting action by the Procureur General de la Republique.<BR> Although President Mobutu repeatedly expressed his willingness to cooperate with international efforts to facilitate the repatriation of the Rwandan refugees in Zaire, his concrete actions have been less than encouraging. At Faro and subsequent meetings, President Mobutu promised to separate intimidators from the broader refugee population in the camps in eastern Zaire. To date, however, he has identified only a handful of such intimidators. Moreover, President Mobutu has not honored his promise to allow arms inspectors to be posted at the Goma Airport to stop the flow of arms to the Rwandan refugees. In fact, President Mobutu refused to authorize the visit of a group of UN experts investigating flow of arms into the Great Lakes region. Finally, the Law Group is very concerned over Zairian efforts to strip Zairians of Rwandan origin (Banyamulengue) of their Zairian citizenship and expel them to Rwanda.<BR> Despite repeated promises not to obstruct his country's transition to democracy, including those made at Faro, President Mobutu continues to do just that. His visit would engender criticism, demonstrations and certain embarassment for the administration. It would be unfortunate to reward his intransigence with the international legitimacy a visit to the United States would bestow.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, D.C. - Friends of Liberia has learned that Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings, chairman of the Economic Community of West African States, has requested that President Bill Clinton deploy U.S. military forces and provide other resources to help the ECOWAS West African peacekeeping force restore security to Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Mohamed Chambas, Ghana's Deputy Foreign Minister, speaking from Accra, said President Rawlings had made the request for U.S. military assistance through diplomatic channels. The request, according to Chambas, is for a short- term commitment of American troops on the ground until ECOMOG, the West African peacekeeping force, can effectively resume its role. U.S.  Special Envoy Dane Smith is expected in Accra on Monday for a meeting with President Rawlings.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kevin George, president of Friends of Liberia, an 800-member group of Americans who espouse a democratic resolution to Liberia's civil war, said &quot;the presence of a U.S. security force, in Africa's most pro-American country, is viewed by President Rawlings as absolutely necessary for the purpose of restoring calm, protecting relief programs and preserving order in Monrovia.&quot; George said the extraordinary nature of such a request underscores the desperate needs of Liberians and their West African neighbors. &quot;For President Clinton to decline this request will not only lead to unnecessary further tragedy in Monrovia, but also greatly exacerbate the decay of U.S. influence in all of West Africa at a time when our foreign policy objectives ostensibly call for peace and democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fighting erupted April 6 in the capital city of Monrovia, previously a safe- haven for one-million Liberians, after a standoff between factions at the edge of the city escalated into a full-scale street battle. ECOMOG forces had been unable to contain the face-off between small groups of combatants representing members of the ruling council and those of an ousted minister.  As the peacekeeping operation fell apart, rival factions conducted a running battle and looted homes and businesses. The fighting finally centered on an army barracks compound, where some 45,000 civilians were holed up. Casualties mounted as the militias representing two ruling council members bombed the seaside barracks. Mediation over the past weekend by envoys from the United States and Ghana, coupled with the arrival offshore of a U.S. naval flotilla carrying over 1,800 Marines, has helped bring about a tenuous cease-fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The heads of seven U.S. organizations -- Africare, Trickle Up, International Rescue Committee, Service and Development Agency, United Methodist Committee on Relief, World Relief, and the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children -- signed with Friends of Liberia a letter urging President Clinton to extend U.S. military protection to relief efforts in Monrovia. They cited the outbreak of disease and dwindling supplies of potable water as signaling the potential for a &quot;humanitarian disaster of monumental proportions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The organizations pointed out that the history of ties to this longtime U.S. ally, with its distinctly pro-American society, assures that humanitarian intervention by the United States will be welcomed not only by Liberians, but by the West African nations that created the peacekeeping force to prevent a regional conflagration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Rawlings is expected to make a similar case to U.S. Special Envoy Smith in their meeting next week and at an ECOWAS Heads of State Summit on May 8. Rawlings said recently in Ghana that the West African peacekeeping troops, at their current strength of 8,000, are inadequate to effect the type of security relief workers need to reintroduce order in the city.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mogadishu - One never knows what is going to happen next in Mogadishu.  Everything is unorthodox, from the moment the twin-engine plane touches down on a beach strip some 30 kilometres north of the city to the jolting ride through sand dunes until arrival at the once- beautiful Indian Ocean idyll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dusty route passes alongside kilometre upon kilometre of sandy beaches lapped by the blue ocean waters. Paradise, if one ignores the five armed guards crouching in the back of the truck, numerous roadblocks and prolific gun-toting Somalis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Guns and people increase as one approaches the centre of the devastated city, north of the American imposed &quot;green line&quot; dividing Mogadishu between Somali's two major warlords: Ali Mahdi Mohammed in the north and his arch rival in the south, General Mohammed Farah Aideed. Fighting is sporadic at the moment, but the city is like a tightly coiled spring and tension mounts as one approaches the border between the two halves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the north imposed the deterrent Islamic Sharia law - which punishes crime by flogging, amputation or death - and an order banning the carrying of weapons, the situation has eased somehow in that part of the city. There is a degree of normality as people go about their daily business amid the bullet-scarred ruins of formerly elegant buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the atmosphere is more menacing in the south where Aideed has armed his militias to the teeth and introduced a &quot;tax&quot; on goods entering the area, enforced by Kalashnikov-carrying toughs who man the collection points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The demarcation line is probably the most inflammable area of the city and totally unpredictable. One can sail unhindered between the two halves one day, but the next come face to face with a hostile crowd brandishing and loading guns, before pointing them threateningly at the vehicle. It is a war of nerves. On one hand it may just be a case of sabre-rattling, but on the other, thugs are liable to pull the trigger without warning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To all intents and purposes the world has left Somalia to get on with it, despite a reaffirmation by the United Nations which finally pulled out its troops early last year, of its commitment to the country. Last February, a fact-finding mission held talks with both Aideed and Ali Mahdi during which the latter appealed for more humanitarian aid, saying he feared renewed famine if Somalia remained internationally isolated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aid agencies left a long time ago, hot on the heels of the abortive 1992-95 United States and UN missions to restore peace to the country. A handful of relief agencies operate north of the green line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the south, only one organisation remains. SOS Children's Villages - a non-governmental organisation which was in place long before the civil war broke out in 1991 - runs the only properly functioning hospital in the entire city, caring mainly for children. Its wards are full of pot-bellied infants suffering from severe malnutrition, malaria, cholera and tuberculosis.  Hundreds of mothers throng the gates daily seeking help for their children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former children's hospital, Benadir, has become an Aideed clan hospital. And the so-called state hospital, Digfer, also in the south is drab, dingy and barely functioning. Otherwise private clinics exist for the rich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The international airport and main harbour are insecure and therefore in-operational, so food and medical aid have to be trucked in from private air strips and ports to the north and south of the city, heightening the danger of attacks and looting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an anarchic situation, every possibility can be exploited, including the provision of power, water and telecommunications which again only the very rich can afford. Most people go without.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The wealthy are also setting about reconstructing parts of the shattered city. Here and there, lavish villas are being restored to their former glory - signs of opulence amid the ruins. Not far from the former UN and US compounds, now plundered and destroyed, work was under way to rebuild a palatial four-storey residence set among palm trees and vibrant bougainvillae.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At Mogadishu's sprawling Bakara market anything can be acquired for a price. Besides serving as a huge open air arms bazaar, Bakara is the place to find passports, degree certificates or money changers who can come up with thousands of US dollars within minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opportunists, it seems, abound. A local mullah gets louder. &quot;Probably through a looted sound system,&quot; residents remark stoically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> War weary Somalis have had their hopes raised and dashed so many times since the start of this decade that they are cynical about peace. Aideed, chasing his cherished dream of becoming Somali president, could not wait and declared himself Somali leader last June. At the moment, he is concentrating his militias outside Mogadishu, in the Baidoa and Kismayo regions, which has given the city a brief respite, but the anarchy now raging has become endemic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In-clan fighting is complicated by squabbles among sub-groups belonging to the same family. People kill and maim with impunity. Reason lies in the barrel of a gun or the flick of a knife. In one incident, a young man had his throat slit form ear to ear in an argument over the equivalent of 50 US cents, a reminder that violence is always prevalent and that the absence of all-out fighting should not lull one into a false sense of security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the intricate politics of the country become more and more entangled with news of defections from Ali Mahdi's Abgal clan to Aideed's side, killings of prominent personalities who do not appeal to one side or the other are on the rise and the chances of a national reconciliation government are pretty remote. Many Somalis believe the answer to the country's problems lies in the creation of regional governing councils along clan lines, but influential businessmen have no interest in seeing an end to the conflict and as usual the powerful warlords will not relinquish their power bases without a fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By the time of going to press, three Somali political organisations and movements in the Kenyan capital , Nairobi, on April 15 announced the formation of a consultation group that aims to seek a peaceful solution to their war-wrecked nation of an estimated population of 7 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Led by Mr. Mohammed Awale, international relations secretary for the United Somali Congress (USC) and Somali National Alliance (SNA), the Somali factions meeting during a four-day consultative conference on the crisis at home, decried the suffering of the people of Somalia as a result of continued disagreements among the various factional leaders and the overriding factor that there is no government in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Awale and his team comprising among others, Yusuf Mohamed of the Somali National Democratic Union, Mr. Mohamed Abdi of the Union of Somali Peoples, Mr. Abdullahi Bashir of the Union of Somali Roots and Abdurahman Hassan, representing the Somali Salvation Democratic Front, hoped to deliberate on ways and means of establishing</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - As the world researchers intensify efforts to seek treatment for the dreaded Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) with an arsenal of palliative drugs and potential vaccines, sub-Saharan Africa, home to about 70 per cent of the world's estimated 15.5 million sufferers, is disturbingly removed from the scene of serious research and runs the risk of benefiting least from ongoing findings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Media sources say that today, 15 years into the AIDS pandemic, patients have the promise of controlling the deadly HIV virus that results in AIDS, &quot;thanks to a sudden influx of new drugs unlike that ever marshalled against any other disease before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gordon Nary, executive director of the International Association of Physicians in AIDS Care is quoted saying, &quot;it is such an extraordinary time of both discovery and hope. For many people today with HIV, there is a very good possibility.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The good possibility alluded to lies in the fact that these new drugs, called protease inhibitors, &quot;attack the HIV virus that causes AIDS differently from all other medicines, and the two newest ones, Hoffman Laroche's Saquinavir and Abbot Laboratories more powerful Indunavir can almost eliminate virus Lurking in patients' blood.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bad news is that these drugs have been developed by private researchers and are not tailored for the poor sub-Saharan patient who heavily depends on poorly equipped public health facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AIDS patients, until now had five choices: AZT, DDI, DDC, D4T and 3TC.  All reportedly worked the same way, targeting an enzyme called reverse transcriptase that is important if HIV is to reproduce. But the drugs are said to have helped only modestly, and HIV quickly mutates to resist them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Scientists specifically designed drugs to target a second enzyme, protease, that is vital to another key step in the reproduction of HIV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When combined with older medicines, the two most powerful protease inhibitors can cause the amount of HIV floating in many patients' blood to plummet by up to 98 per cent. However, caution is given that HIV still lurks elsewhere in the body. Thus, the drugs are not a cure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With various reports about new developments against the dreaded killer AIDS, sub-Saharan Africa is nowhere near benefiting from the emerging AIDS therapies, primarily because of the prohibitive costs of the newly developed drugs. Treating HIV as a chronic disease, says executive director of the International Association of Physicians in AIDS, Gordon Nary, could cost each patient 250,000 US dollars. Adding shipment costs and the profits to be made off sub- Saharan patients, the cost of such drugs would be prohibitive by the time they reach African patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London based PANOS Institute in its February 1996 Media AIDS Information sheet states that the best medical solution to the AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa, and indeed for the rest of the developing world, lies &quot;in the development of a vaccine, rather than a cure, according to an increasing number of scientists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report further argues that a vaccine is likely to be less expensive than a drug treatment and may only need to be administered once.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three developing countries; Thailand, Brazil and Uganda agreed to conduct trials of experimental vaccines developed in the United States of America. But whereas these trials have been going on in Thailand since 1995, the Ugandan tests seem to have hit a snag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kapitaine Khantawai, the Technical Officer of the Global Programme on AIDS in Uganda, (a World Health Organisation Programme) told APS that the much awaited trials are yet to take off. &quot;We do not know what really is going on, the issue seems to be fizzling out,&quot; he explained. The WHO office in Entebbe, Uganda, which should be conducting the trial vaccines declined to give any comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the other hand, the Kampala- based AIDS Support Organisation (TASO's) director, Sophia Mukasa Moniko, told APS that the office does not know anything about the proposed trial vaccines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TASO, which reaches out to over 40,000 AIDS patients in Uganda is the first organised community response to the AIDS epidemic in the East African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Founded in 1987 by a group of volunteers, TASO provides counselling, AIDS information, nursing care, educational support and material assistance to people with HIV/AIDS and their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For now, all our treatment is made up of palliative care, counselling and social support. We deal with restoring and improving hope. We are using neither vaccines nor curative drugs,&quot; she told this writer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, even with the emergence of trial vaccines, few scientists believe that a vaccine will be available within the next five years. Still, PANOS reports, the emerging trial vaccines are beset by a number of problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main problem is that the HIV virus is highly variable. The Media AIDS Information reports that there are two types of HIV,- HIV-1 and HIV-2, both of which cause AIDS. HIV-1 is by far the most common, hence most current vaccine research is directed at it. HIV- 2, prevalent in West African countries, is said to have been hardly researched on. This means that even if a vaccine was successfully developed against HIV-1 most of the western parts of sub-Saharan Africa will still have no vaccine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Worse still both viruses (HIV-1 and HIV-2) are said to appear in many different forms. A vaccine based on one form may or may not provoke an immune response that &quot;recognises&quot; others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As if this were not enough, even the HIV-1 type alone is classified into approximately nine other sub-types, from A through H and O.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In sub-Saharan Africa different sub-tribes of the HIV-1 variant proliferate. Sub-tribe A, for example, is found in Central and East Africa, B in Southern Africa, D in East, Central and Southern Africa, F in Zaire and G, H, and O in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This proliferation of sub types in sub-Saharan Africa, makes it very arduous for scientists to develop suitable vaccines. &quot;A major problem facing scientists, is that a vaccine which protects against one subWorse still, the variant vaccine being tested in Thailand today is based on type B which is found in the Americas, Europe, Japan and Thailand. The subtype B has dominated the epidemic in much of the industrialised world. Hence the trial vaccines currently going on have nothing to do with sub-Saharan Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> type may not provide protection against someone infected with other sub-types,&quot; says the PANOS publication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Says Dr Khisa Joseph who runs a private clinic in the Kenyan capital, which also gives advice and care to AIDS patients; &quot;Scientists in sub-Saharan Africa must intensify research on the cure of the dreaded AIDS pandemic.  Dependence on Western researchers might eventually not help much as they carry out their research with their own people in mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the PANOS report, &quot;there is little effort going into developing vaccines based on subtypes prevalent in Africa, such as A and D&quot;.  Apart from the scientific problems, &quot;there has been little practical focus on the needs of the developing world. Vaccine research and development is extremely expensive,&quot; the report adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even as concerned scientists and others focus their efforts on establishing initiatives to accelerate the development of vaccines that the world can afford, African scientists and governments should prepare for action and seriously plunge into the research process too. Minus the input from Africans, nobody will make efforts to alleviate the suffering of the estimated 11 million HIV/AIDS patients currently in sub-Saharan Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Over 30,000 prospective Muslim pilgrims from Nigeria will not travel to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, for the annual Hajj Pilgrimage. The religious devotees have been banned this year due to an unusually severe meningitis epidemic that has swept through the northern part of this West African country over the last four months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dry season is just coming to a close in Africa's &quot;meningitis belt&quot; comprising Nigeria, Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali. During the period November 1995 to March 1996, the World Health Organisation (WHO) confirmed more than 9,000 deaths out of some 75,000 people who contracted cerebro-spinal meningitis in the region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The outbreak was complicated by flare-ups of cholera, measles and inflammation of the stomach and intestines, probably due to blood poisoning.  Experts say new disease dynamics in Africa only make more intricate the fight against meningitis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigerian military authorities have complained bitterly following the decision by the Saudi authorities. However, authorities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia do not trust Nigerian vaccination certificates and fear the sudden entry of a large number of citizens from this country will endanger millions of other pilgrims visiting Muslim Holy sites this April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign relief agencies led by Medicins Sans Frontiers flew millions of vaccines into Nigeria, Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali - &quot;the African meningitis belt&quot; - in an effort to contain the seasonal outbreak of cerebro spinal meningitis that has claimed thousands of lives, mainly children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of those lucky to survive may be maimed for life due to the damage caused to the brain and spinal cord tissues. Surviving victims may suffer permanent damage to their hearing (they become deaf) while other effects include epilepsy, constant headaches and poor coordination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the small West African nation of Burkina Faso with some 9 million people, authorities say more than 2,000 perished during the first three months of 1996. The exact number of people killed in the same epidemic in the more populous Nigeria will probably never be known. The authorities are notorious for doctoring such statistics. In February, Ichechukwa Madubuike, Nigeria's Health Minister said 15,000 people had died, an assertion that was quickly denied by the military government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is significant that most of the deaths occurred in the northern areas of Kano-Kaduna - Sokoto. Kano is the home state of military strongman General Sani Abacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the peak of the epidemic in January/February, reports spoke of more than 100 deaths per day. Medical workers bitterly complained of inadequate facilities to fight the disease. Relatively cheap drugs like chloraphenicol were missing at this critical time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dry season meningitis is a bacterial infection. The culprit bacterium Neisseria meningitidis is a common one and is usually spread by sneezing and coughing. Normally, these bacteria live harmlessly in the nose or throat of the individual but for reasons that are not understood may suddenly becomes a killer. The bacteria penetrate the body's natural defence system (the immune system) enter the blood stream and proceed to attack the brain including its membranes (meninges) and the spinal cord. If not diagnosed and treated early, this disease is a swift killer. Death may ensue within 24 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WHO says in recent decades, most of the countries within the &quot;meningitis belt&quot; have experienced large outbreaks every eight years.  However, quite significantly, intervals between major epidemics &quot;have become shorter and more irregular since the 80's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Epidemics usually expand rapidly and peak within weeks but may last several months - as it did this year in the absence of vaccination campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The warning is clearly on the wall. Health planners in the meningitis belt nations should understand and work in future to contain the worst ravages before they happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Michel Englebert of Medicins Sans Frontiers - Belgium, working in Nairobi says, the entry of foreign variants of the common meningitis germ has somehow complicated the picture. Meningitis A is the common organism of cerebro-spinal meningitis but a variant of this was traced from Nepal in 1983 to the meningitis belt in Africa via the Middle East in the late 80s and early 90s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another common player is meningitis C. The important point to be noted is that Asian variants of the common meningitis strain do not respect the seasons. The result is that the seasonal nature of the epidemics could change in those annually affected areas of Africa. More cases of non-seasonal epidemics may also be seen elsewhere in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For example in 1994, there was an outbreak of meningitis in the refugee camps in Goma, Zaire. At the time, we had not realised that the Asian variant was in Africa. That outbreak was unusual because it came at the beginning of the rain season,&quot; observes Dr. Englebert. The Asian variant does not respect seasons, he observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Factors affecting the occurrence and spread of meningitis epidemics in &quot;the belt&quot; include decreasing immunity in a population, overcrowding and climatic conditions such as the dry season and prolonged droughts. Some of these factors explain why meningitis has become a major killer of inmates in prisons across the African continent. Indeed General Olusegun Obasanjo, now a political prisoner in Nigeria, had to be moved for fear that he would get the disease in one badly affected prison in the recent epidemic in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Englebert says sand and dust storms during the dry season in the affected areas are believed to damage the cellular lining of the throat and nasal cavities (mucosa), facilitating the entry of germs into the body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Understanding the meningitis symptoms is absolutely important if lives are to be saved. For an infant below one year, symptoms include diarrhoea, vomiting, complete weakness (lassitude) and bulging fontanelle - the soft spot on top of the baby's head. This may be quite evident in the anterior fontanelle. The bulge is due to increased fluid pressure around the brain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among adults, symptoms include high fever, severe headache, neck stiffness vomiting and pain in the joints. Children older than one year who complain of headache, stiff neck and have high fever should see a doctor.  Many children die needlessly each year because a parent dismissed such symptoms as a small matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Englebert says Medicins Sans Frontiers -Belgium, has trained community health workers in refugee camps in Kenya to detect very quickly diseases like cholera and meningitis. The cheapest antibiotic in the treatment of meningitis is chloraphenicol.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - A challenging collection of 24 prophetic sermons preached by the Rt. Rev. David M. Gitari of the Church of the Province of Kenya (CPK), has been published in a new book entitled, &quot;In Season and Out of Season, Sermons to a Nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The book launched at a press conference on April 18 here, includes a sermon Rev. Gitari preached following the assassination on March 3, 1975 of J.M. Kariuki, an anti-colonial activist and populist Member of Parliament. It was broadcast live from the Nairobi Baptist Church following a verse by verse analysis of the Kenya National Anthem in the radio programme, &quot;Lift up your Hearts&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is a sermon that earned the bishop, then only a priest, a lot of wrath from State House Mombasa and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, both asking him to explain the texts of the sermons.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other notable sermons in the book include a sermon entitled, &quot;Who knows&quot;. It calls for peace and the need to be united, then only two weeks before the August 1982 attempted coup that lasted a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Each of the 24 sermons is an attempt by Gitari who is at pains to apply the biblical message to the complex contemporary scene in Kenya influenced by the example of such preachers as Martin Luther King and John Stott.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his characteristic style, Rev. Gitari is not afraid to speak out on social and political issues and against corruption and injustices. Where appropriate, the setting and background of the sermon is provided as well as events which followed the preaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Answering questions from journalists, concerning involvement of clergy in politics, particularly the recent case of the Retired Anglican Archbishop Manasses Kuria as umpire of the opposition Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (Ford-Kenya) elections, Bishop Gitari said Archbishop Kuria accepted the role in very good faith but has been let down by the people he was trying to help. He noted that being a returning officer was a very complex issue especially when one did not have direct access to the grassroots people in the short time available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Acting Archbishop of the CPK stressed that his church has been engaged in the democratic process in this country, has not shied away from politics and will not do so in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The church has in the past conducted civic education with other churches and groups to educate people about their rights and issues of justice, and she will continue to do this, Rev. Gitari stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He pointed out that a clergyman's involvement in politics was done out of one's own conviction but added that religion and politics cannot be separated because both advance the betterment of the human person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Acting Archbishop caused laughter when he said that politicians are happy when they are praised by clergy but the moment they are criticized they tell the clergymen to shut up and not mix religion with politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But where one wants to be a member of parliament, Bishop Gitari said such a person should resign his church position and be elected to parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the issue of elections of the Bishop of the Mt. Kenya South Diocese, the CPK Dean said four names had been approved by the Provincial Electoral College.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The candidates are the Very Rev. Peter Njenga, Provost All Saints Cathedral, Nairobi, Rev. Canon David Njoroge Kamau, Rev. John Wanjihia and Rev. Samuel Muturi, the latter three from Mt. Kenya South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Diocesan Synod of Mt. Kenya South will meet next month to elect their new bishop from among the four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The election of the third Archbishop of the CPK will remain pending until most of the church's 22 dioceses present the names of their delegates to represent them at the elections. Archbishop Kuria retired in December 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The book by Bishop Gitari was published by Paternoster Press, United Kingdom. The 155-page book is available in leading bookshops in the country at a cover price of KShs. 400 (US dollars 7.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Present during the launching ceremony was the Rev. Canon Gideon Ireri, Director of CPK's Justice and Peace Commission.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Machakos, Kenya - Bishop Taban Paride of Torit Catholic diocese in southern Sudan has challenged churches to redouble their efforts on issues pertaining to peace and reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It would be naive to imagine that all is well when we have some parts of southern Sudan seriously affected by insecurity yet at the same time some of us are busy signing the so called peace agreements with our enemies without full consent of the entire affected community,&quot; the Sudanese Bishop told the General Assembly of the New Sudan Council of Churches (NSCC) meeting here, some 65 kilometres southeast of the capital, Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Catholic prelate was referring to the recently signed peace agreement between Dr. Riak Machar's South Sudan Independence Movement (SSIM) and the Khartoum Government of Lt. General Al Bashir.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;How can Dr. Machar accept to enter into such a deal with Bashir - when he clearly knows that the latter is not committed to &quot;real&quot; peace and reconciliation? And why commit the community in the south when he knows this?&quot; Bishop Paride posed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He further told the 50 delegates at the April 14 to 18 Assembly, among them bishops drawn from the NSCC member churches, that such actions (signing of the peace agreement) for individual rather than community benefits clearly explained that churches, as one of many institutions involved in peace and reconciliation in southern Sudan, had yet a wider role to play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On April 4, this year, Machar and the Khartoum government signed a political charter &quot;to bring to an end the on-going civil war in southern Sudan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a press statement reporting on the agreement, the pact between both parties was reached after secret and persistent talks between the SSIM and the government during the last few months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing the NSCC Assembly, John Garang led Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) Secretary for Humanitarian Affairs Mr. Arthur Akuien Chol said Dr. Machar's recent action went a long way to prove that some of &quot;our brothers are not for real peace and unity for the entire south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think the action is proof that some of our brothers would rather work with our enemies than with their brothers. This, in a way is a big drawback for the liberation struggle we have waged against the Khartoum government over its domination of the majority southerners,&quot; the SPLA official noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several speakers stressed the need for the NSCC to facilitate the shifting of its operational headquarters from the Kenyan capital, Nairobi to Narus - about 50 kilometres from the Kenya/Sudan border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is logical that we start to think seriously when and how we should serve our people from inside and not from Nairobi,&quot; said one delegate, in his contribution during one of the sessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview with APS, the Acting NSCC Executive Secretary, Mr. Rob Haarsager said of the location of offices, &quot;things are gradually moving toward that direction but with no deadlines as some delegates would like to see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The assembly was also attended by a number of ecumenical partners, mainly from Britain, Germany and Ireland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It attracted delegates from the five- member churches of NSCC, namely the Roman Catholic Church, Episcopal Church of Sudan, Presbyterian Church of Sudan, Africa Inland Church and Sudan Interior Church. The Sudan Pentecostal Church, an associate member of NSCC was also represented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The member churches of NSCC operate in the liberated areas of southern Sudan. The NSCC was officially instituted in 1990. Its first General Assembly was held in 1991.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a hearing that resumed yesterday at the first Criminal Bench of the Central High Court, the witness answered questions posed by 13 defense lawyers including those raised by defendants Captain Begashaw Atalay and Captain Tessema Belay who had dismissed their lawyers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Majors Kassaye Aragaw and Melaku Teferra who had also dismissed their defense lawyers said they had no questions to the first witness. The court ruled out the appeal made on the occasion by the two defendants on the ground that it would not hear an appeal while undergoing cross- examination and advised them to submit it in a written form to the office of the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite its decision to continue the hearing yesterday, the Special Prosecutor requested the court to postpone the hearing of the second witness for next Tuesday because he was not ready to bring the witness before the court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - The remarkable gains achieved over the past two years are the living testimonies to the highest stage of development the Ethiopian Airlines has reached .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The remark came from Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister Tamirat Layine on the occasion of the Golden Jubilee of the EAL which was celebrated here yesterday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the EAL has shown a significant change following the restructuring it underwent and the increase in its annual budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The profit obrained by the airlines has grown from 10-15 million birr 2 years ago to 100 million afterwards, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Deputy Prime Minister recalled that the steps taken by the government two years ago to restructure the EAL with the aim of enabling it to become profitable was either wrongly understood or destorted on purpose by some parties. He said however, the government had a strong conviction that the restructuring would be instrumental in bringing about an encouraging and a promising result within the airlines such as the one that has just been registered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ato Tamirat pledged government's continued support for the effort of ensuring increased improvement and growth of the EAL and called upon the management staff and workers of the airlines to join hands in building the institution s capacity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tunis - Pope John Paul II has appealed for dialogue between Christians and Muslims, but in the same breath attacked religious fundamentalism of any kind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first ever Catholic Pope to visit Tunisia, John Paul II used the 10-hour visit to the Tunisian capital on April 14 to appeal for dialogue and tolerance between Christians and Muslims, and called for the release of seven French Trappist monks kidnapped on March 27 by Islamic extremists in Tunisia's strife-torn western neighbour, Algeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Roman Catholic pontiff also met President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and the country's civilian authorities during the whistle-stop visit, during which he called for &quot;deeper mutual understanding&quot; between Christians and Muslims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On his 70th foreign trip since becoming pope in 1978, John Paul celebrated mass in the 100-year-old cathedral in Tunis before some 1,500 people representing the country's tiny Catholic community.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He urged them to continue their social action &quot;in collaboration with your Muslim friends.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Pope then left Tunis for Rome after ending the visit with a brief trip to the ruins of the Roman amphitheatre at Carthage in remembrance of martyred Christians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier, holding his first mass in an Arab Muslim country, the pontiff declared: &quot;Diverse of language, culture, origin, you are the living image of universal church. The ferments of unity and solidarity should emerge from your links with the North and the South, East and West.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During mass, John Paul II also evoked the issue of the kidnapped Trappist monks in Algeria, saying he hoped &quot;to see an end to their ordeal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Europeans mingled with Tunisians on the cathedral square, as many were unable to enter the building due to tight security measures enforced by Tunisian authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Afterwards, the Pope met eight bishops from the Episcopal Conference of North Africa including those from Tunisia, Morocco, Libya and Algeria, where several priests and nuns have been killed or abducted by Islamic militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With them, he prayed &quot;that peace and reconciliation come quickly to Algerian soil, in the just respect of differences,&quot; and also voiced solidarity with the Libyan people living under a UN embargo &quot;which seriously affects the daily life of the population.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Pope also launched an appeal for peace in Africa and in countries of the Mediterranean region, in particular in the Middle East, and condemned fundamentalism in any guise, insisting that &quot;no one can kill in the name of God, no one can accept killing his brother.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After mass, the 75-year-old pontiff, who has suffered several bouts of ill-health in recent months, but looked relatively fit, went on a short walkabout to greet several hundred Catholics and Muslims, whose posters and banners in French and Arabic welcomed the head of the worldwide Roman Catholic Church to a country where &quot;tolerance reigns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He evoked the importance of &quot;a brotherly relationship, always deeper, more spiritual&quot; between Catholics and Muslims in this country of some 8 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Where violence and discord is sown, you should act as messengers of peace coming from God and reconciliation,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Referring to Mediterranean peoples' &quot;common fate,&quot; the pontiff stressed the importance &quot;of peace and the renunciation of all violence within each society and between nations, so that dialogue and cooperation between the countries of the North and the South can develop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Ben Ali, who has cracked down harshly on Muslim fundamentalism in Tunisia, said: &quot;Tunisia, a country of moderation, dialogue and tolerance, and a beacon of Islam, ... is honoured to welcome the Holy Father.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Civil strife in Algeria has claimed some 50,000 lives since January 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tunisia, the first part of North Africa to see Christian missionaries in the fourth century, has no more than 20,000 Catholics today, compared with some 260,000 when the country gained independence from France in 1956.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Relations between Tunis and the Vatican have traditionally been good, which has not always been the case with other countries in the region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Freetown - Monrovia's Roman Catholic Archbishop Michael Francis was among those evacuated from the Liberian capital to neighbouring Sierra Leone on April 14, after being robbed at his home in the Liberian capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking on arrival here, Archbishop Francis said of his unidentified attackers: &quot;They came to my house. They wanted money and held us at gunpoint, so we gave them all the money we had.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amid continuing unrest in Liberia, forces loyal to warlords Charles Taylor and Alhaji Kromah were continuing a week-old siege of rival fighters holding some 600 hostages in the Barclay Training Center (BTC), a central barracks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Liberian-born Archbishop said there were &quot;hundreds of people&quot; outside the United States Embassy compound in Monrovia trying to leave the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In this situation, what can you do, where can you go when your life is at stake?&quot; he said, when asked why he left the country he had lived in for more than 20 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said he thought the current crisis was the worst in Liberia's history and announced he would travel shortly to the Vatican to discuss the crisis with Pope John Paul II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The archbishop's departure came as rival forces unleashed confused attacks on an army barracks packed with several thousand rebel Krahn fighters holding hundreds of hostages and thousands of refugees, while at least 15 corpses were strewn around the area of the Barclay Training Center (BTC), surrounded by Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Forces of Liberia and Alhaji Kromah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fighting at Barclay Training Centre barracks which has intensified since it started on April 7 when government troops in pursuit of ULIMO-J leader, Roosevelt Johnson, who had fled his home in the northeastern district of Sinkor, &quot;were attacked by (members) of the Krahn faction loyal to Johnson, &quot;many of whom live in the barracks, according to a government statement broadcast on radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least 156 people have died in the camp in the past few days, and several hundred others wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ruling council of state also confirmed that the heavy fighting had broken out at the central barracks between supporters of Johnson, currently wanted on murder charges, and government troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government also confirmed Krahn fighters had sprung former chief of staff Charles Julue from a jail in Barclay Training Centre, where he was serving a seven-year term jail term for his involvement in a coup plot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Julue was released by &quot;dissidents&quot; of Johnson &quot;and is well-armed and fighting alongside Johnson's forces,&quot; according to a government statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said several prisoners at the Monrovia central jail had also been released and armed to fight alongside fighters loyal to Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are also reports that members of the Armed Forces of Liberia, a mainly Krahn faction and formerly the West African country's regular army under Julue's command, had joined the Johnson camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberia's ethnic Krahns, who are the centre of the latest bloody fighting, the worst seen in the capital in the last four years, dominated the upper echelons of this country throughout the 1980s, even though they comprise less than 10 per cent of the estimated 2.6 million population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johnson, who until his ousting last month led the Krahn wing of the United Liberation Movement (ULIMO-J), is not a member of the interim collective presidency, unlike fellow Krahn George Boley, leader of the Liberia Peace Council (LPC), another armed faction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Krahns come from the southeast of Liberia and first appeared on the political scene in April 1980 after a coup led one of their number, Master Sergeant Samuel Doe, which ended years of domination by descendants of freed slaves who founded Liberia in 1922.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The murder of Doe's predecessor, President William Tolbert, and the televised execution of 13 ministers and senior government officials, set the brutal tone of the first Liberian regime to be run by an indigenous ethnic group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Key political and military posts were quickly filled by Krahns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Doe gradually eliminated all opposition and installed a corrupt reign of terror that fuelled bitter ethnic rivalry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was tortured to death in September 1990 by a breakaway faction of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), led by Charles Taylor, the man who set off Liberia's civil war in December 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the last peace negotiations, which ended in an accord signed last August in the Nigerian federal capital Abuja, the Krahns put forward a united front, delegating Boley to sit on the collective presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Krahn fighters are now dispersed among the Armed Forces of Liberia - formerly Doe's presidential guard but reformed since his death - the LPC, based in the southeast, and ULIMO-J, founded in March 1994 by Johnson after the original ULIMO split into Krahn and Mandingo wings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - Nearly 800 people have died in inter-ethnic clashes in two incidents in Nigeria, the country's press have reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the first incident, around 700 people were killed in the past one week along Nigeria's southeastern border with Cameroon, the independent daily Tribune reported on April 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The newspaper said 200 people were injured in the clashes in Cross River State, but a government official, while confirming the clashes, said the newspaper's toll was exaggerated.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clashes between Ugep and Adim people were sparked over land disputes in the regions of Yakur and Biassa, the newspaper said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Public buildings, including schools, were destroyed by fires and women and children from both communities fled villages fearing an escalation of violence, it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The state's military administrator, Colonel Gregory Agbonemi, has ordered stepped up security to restore calm to the area and announced an inquiry into the clashes, the newspaper said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On April 15, the official News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported that about 80 people were also killed and 6,000 forced to flee their homes in clashes between Karimojos and Fulani herdsmen in Nigeria's northeastern Taraba state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fighting erupted on April 7 in the town of Karim Lamido and spread to other parts of the region, NAN reported late on April 14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The violence followed an alleged rape bid by a Fulani, NAN said, quoting villagers, who said the man overpowered his Karimojo victim and sliced off her left hand with a knife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police and local officials had called on Karimojos not to retaliate, saying the incident was an isolated one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A series of peace meetings between the two communities resulted in a short period of calm, but on Easter Sunday homes in the village of Madaka were set on fire, allegedly by Fulanis, while the villagers were in church, triggering the violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dead included 21 people whose burnt bodies were deposited at a government mortuary in Bambur, NAN reported. More than 10 people died when a mob attacked a police station in Karim Lamido.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the two communities, more than 500 houses have been destroyed and their owners have fled to the neighbouring states of Adamawa and Bauchi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> State police chief Alhaji Yunusa Yahaya said 20 people had been arrested. Soldiers and armed police officers have been deployed to halt the violence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Retired Anglican Archbishop Manasses Kuria abruptly quit his role as umpire at a delegates congress of Kenya's leading opposition party, Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD-Kenya) party, after an intended leadership poll on April 13 degenerated into acrimonious exchange and stone throwing between two factions in the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police had to fire tear gas to quell the rival combatants in the inter-party fracas that left a number of people injured at Thika Stadium, the congress venue, 30 kilometres from Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The congress was called to sort out a long standing leadership wrangle in Ford Kenya but it never achieved it purpose after a bitterly frustrated Kuria abruptly terminated his mediator and umpire role. He had stepped in last month after a number of prominent would be mediators turned down the task.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are two camps within the party. That of Kijana Wamalwa, the incumbent leader of Ford-Kenya and the camp of Raila Odinga, son of party founder, the late Jaramogi Oginga Odinga. Raila has never accepted his earlier defeat in party polls held in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Raila Odinga leads a mainly Luo faction (third largest of Kenya's ethnic groups) while Wamalwa has broader national support including Luos, besides that of his own Luhya community, Kenya's second largest group after the Kikuyus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A dress rehearsal for the violence at Thika happened three days earlier when a youth was stabbed to death within the precincts of the Anglican All Saints Cathedral, Nairobi, where Archbishop Kuria conducted a meeting of rival factions. The retired prelate had to summon police to disperse the rival youth gangs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the abortive congress at Thika, the whole exercise collapsed after Raila's supporters and their leader charged that Kuria favoured Wamalwa. The two factions also failed to agree on procedures and delegates' list. By early afternoon, an exasperated Kuria had enough of the anarchy and he called it quits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As he was leaving the venue some youths attacked his car with stones but he was not injured. Police intervened and the prelate was able to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the collapse of the congress, the rival Wamalwa and Raila factions held their own separate elections which analysts say are a sign of a split in Ford-Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the meantime, Nakuru Catholic Bishop Ndingi Mwana a' Nzeki has received overwhelming support from clergy in Kenya - both Catholic and Protestant - in the wake of concerted attack on him by politicians and government officials, following remarks he made expressing fear of a resurgence of the much dreaded ethnic clashes in a section of the Rift Valley Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 500 priests and bishops have sent messages of solidarity and support for the bishop. The clergy urge the government to ensure that law and order prevail in the Molo area of Nakuru Diocese, some 180 kilometres north-west of Nairobi, rather than vilify Bishop Ndingi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The matter started on Easter Sunday when Bishop Ndingi urged the government to investigate reports by people in Molo area of his diocese that unknown people had been seen entering the local forests. The alleged strangers in the forest had caused great anxiety as it was feared they were using the forest in preparation for a new round of ethnic clashes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1992/1993, Molo area was a major flash point that left hundreds dead and thousands displaced. The clashes believed to be politically instigated, mainly pitted the Kalejin against other groups including the Kikuyu and Luhya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the height of varied reactions to Bishop Ndingi's claims, the Nakuru District Commissioner, John Abduba on April 10 led a team of government officials and journalists into the local forests to verify whether any attackers were hiding there. The journalists also talked to residents in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In response to the matter, Embu Catholic Bishop John Njue said issues raised by his Nakuru counterpart &quot;were quite sensitive and should be thoroughly investigated.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - The Sudanese Embassy in Nairobi has dismissed as propaganda a statement released here by the Sudan Catholic Information Office (CSCIO). The statement charged that Government of Sudan forces comprising 700 men from El Saraf el Ahmar garrison on March 23 and 24, burned down two villages in the Nuba Mountains, destroying crops in the field and stock in granaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking to APS the Counsellor of the Embassy, Mr. Ali Sadiq asserted that it was illogical for the government which has always tried to assist its people to also engage in acts of destruction, further emphasizing that &quot;it is the government's noble responsibility to assure security and protect the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Sadiq said he was ready to issue a visa to anyone who cared to find out the truth rather than believe accounts from the SCIO. He likened the Catholic Information Office report, attributed to Msgr. Macram Max Gassi, the Catholic Bishop of El Obeid and Father Kizito Sesana, to similar reports by human rights organisation Amnesty International, which he said was constantly at war with the Islamic Government of Sudan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Sadiq said his government did not discriminate against any section of the community, whether they were Christians or not, pointing out that Sudan's Foreign Affairs Minister and the Vice- President are Christians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reacting to the SCIO statement, the Sudanese Ambassador to Kenya dismissed anything coming from a Christian source as false and thus should not be believed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SCIO statement dated April 16, says that the government forces attacked, looted and burnt the two villages in Kauda and Toror in the Nuba Mountains, Southern Kordofan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attack, according to Fr. Kizito and Msgr. Max Gassi, left more than 1,000 families homeless and without food. The victims lost property which included clothes, agricultural implements and seeds. However, there were no casualties among the civilians for they had been evacuated in advance by the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), the Catholic clergy said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attacks were also extended to the local Catholic Church in which the government forces also desecrated the tabernacle, smashed into pieces the figure of Christ on the cross, and looted a statue of Mary, mass and prayer books, altar clothes and priest vestments, said SCIO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government forces were, however, repulsed by the Southern Sudan-based SPLA forces which engaged them in the two villages, forcing them to retreat into Kadugli, the report added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SPLA claimed an upper hand in the fight in which it said 25 soldiers from the government forces were killed with the southern movement force losing five men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Giving an account of what he had seen when he was part of a delegation from Nairobi that visited the area on April 14 and 15 and witnessed the destruction, Msgr. Gassis said the main motive behind the Islamic Fundamentalist regime's attack on the villages was to terrorize the civilian population and force them to join the so called &quot;peace Camps&quot;, where women and girls are raped or taken as concubines while male children are enslaved or trained to join the Islamic militia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Catholic Bishop of El Obeid said such actions are targeted not primarily at the SPLA but against the civilians to create fear and hunger so that they are forced to join the infamous &quot;Peace Camps,&quot; where he says there is ample documentation that a policy of ethnic genocide is methodically implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other reason for such actions, he said, was to raise the morale of the army which has been demoralized in recent months having been defeated in Eastern Equatoria and other places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Msgr. Gassis re-affirmed the church's commitment to defend human rights as that was part of her mission in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He condemned the Khartoum regime's action in the Nuba Mountains in the north, terming it as barbarous and immoral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bishop appealed to the world community, the Church and non- Governmental Organisations (NGOs) to go to the rescue of Sudan's Nuba population who need shelter, medicine, food, salt, clothes, utensils and soap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He pointed out that the Nuba Mountains region received very little assistance from the international community or from NGOs since the Sudan government &quot;keeps telling them that the Nuba are assisted by the regime, when in reality the regime starves them and abducts their women and children and burns their crop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nuba Mountains in northern Sudan, stretching over 77,000 square kilometres, is home to some 50 black groups. Today, this area is believed to host only 200,000 people out of more than one million before the current civil war broke out in 1983. The bulk of the area inhabitants have either died, or are living in exile, have been abducted into slavery or deported to occupy up to 100 government &quot;peace villages.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> East London - Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Nobel laureate and chairman of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, broke down and sobbed on April 17 on hearing victims of apartheid-era atrocities tell of police torture, murder and mysterious disappearances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tutu and his fellow commissioners, who started the formal hearings on April 16 listened compassionately as one witness after another at the commission's first public hearings, choked back tears and recounted harrowing stories of human rights violations at the hands of political enemies and police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it was Tutu's turn to cry when the last witness of the day, elderly former activist Singogokwana Malgas, told how beatings during the 30 years he spent in and out of police cells had left him in a wheelchair.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 65-year-old Archbishop of Cape Town buried his head on the table in front of him and wept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I thought I was tough,&quot; Tutu told journalists after the commission adjourned in this Eastern Cape province port. &quot;I thought I was going to survive today ... I keep on thinking whether I am the right person for the Truth Commission.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission is charged with probing politically-linked crimes committed at the height of apartheid between 1960 and 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission was forced to postpone the scheduled testimony of Joyce Mtimkhulu, whose son Siphiwo disappeared mysteriously in 1982, because of threats of legal action by two senior military officers against whom she was going to give evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two men asked a Cape Town court for an interdict to stop Mtimkhulu from taking the stand and to force the commission to hand over to them confidential written statements she made earlier to its investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The court postponed argument on the interdict until April 24 when the commission said, it will fight for its right to keep evidence confidential until witnesses have testified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By the time of going to press, 15 witnesses had appeared before the commission, which is empowered to grant reparations to victims and amnesty to perpetrators who confess their part in political crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the witnesses have so far implicated the former National Party Government or its agents in human rights abuses, but on April 16, for the first time, President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) was also accused of atrocities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bessie Mdoda said her son, Xola Jebe, an ANC guerrilla, had disappeared in one of the ANC's detention camps while fighting outside of South Africa in 1981 and had not seen since, despite claims by ANC leaders in 1990 that he was still alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The widows of the so-called &quot;Cradock Four&quot; - a group of anti- apartheid activists who in 1985 were found charred and mutilated - also told the commission on April 16 of their fruitless struggle to bring their husbands' killers to justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After two inquests and press revelations of a secret document in which senior military officers ordered the permanent removal from society of Matthew Goniwe and his three friends, it was found that the apartheid government was responsible for the deaths, but no person was ever prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission offered the families some relief when they promised to put pressure on South Africa's new democratic government to ensure they receive financial compensation promised last year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - Uganda's Roman Catholic Church has sharply criticised a Kampala newsletter for describing the head of the Catholic community in this East African country as a &quot;drunkard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement read to all Catholic churches in Uganda on April 15, the church described the attack by the Uganda Confidential as an &quot;unfair affront to the Cardinal and an insult to all Catholics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an editorial published on April 12, the Uganda Confidential, a privately owned periodical, reported that Cardinal Emmanuel Wamala had been &quot;influenced by alcohol&quot; when he criticised the country's electoral process of being over shadowed by violence, voter bribing and intimidation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attack by the paper, said to have strong ties with the ruling National Resistance Government followed several others in form of reader's letters in the government- owned New Vision daily, one of which described Catholic priests as &quot;hypocrites in red cassocks.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest furore was prompted by a Reuters news agency report claiming that the Cardinal had made a direct attack on the person of President Yoweri Museveni during the clergy's Easter message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cardinal Wamala has denied the report as &quot;a total distortion of his message which was broadcast live on Radio Uganda and Television on Easter Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a related development, a campaign centre of President Yoweri Museveni's main opponent in Uganda's May 9 elections, has accused state security agents of having been behind election violence on April 14 that disrupted Democratic Party President Paul Ssemogerere's rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the incident in which thousands of people were injured, an unidentified man carrying Museveni's portrait hurled insults at the 5,000 strong crowd stirring up a stampede that sent security agents shooting at random.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the statement published here on April 15, the DP leader's campaign team singled out two senior members of Museveni's task force, three senior officers of the Uganda Army and several members of the country's Internal Security Organisation, who they said were behind alleged plots to disrupt Ssemogerere's rallies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Incidences of violence have been reported in campaigns ahead of the first elections in Uganda in a decade. On April 9, mobs of President Museveni's supporters in the western town of Masindi stoned the entourage of another presidential aspirant Mr. Mohammed Mayanja, forcing him and his team to flee as they tried to address a rally in the town believed to be a stronghold of the incumbent Ugandan president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda Police spokesman Mr. Bob Ngobi, says his men are overwhelmed by the violence and has appealed to voters, especially President Museveni's supporters to calm down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, President Museveni has supported the head of the Catholic Community in this East African country over the latter's criticism of the campaigns to the May 9 presidential poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing supporters on April 15 in Mbarara, 272 kilometres south- west of Kampala, Museveni said the campaign to Uganda's first general election in over a decade was over shadowed by bad language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have heard of bad language being used by aspiring candidates against one another, I do not support this and I advise it to stop,&quot; Museveni said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his Easter Sunday message, Cardinal Emmanuel Wamalwa had attacked &quot;dirty mouthed politicians who should stop the uncivilized act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Cardinal also preached against election rigging and called for &quot;truth and justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile the charge d'affaires at the Royal Nertherlands Embassy in Kampala, Nellke Linsen, has warned that the rebel war in Northern Uganda could be misused to influence results at the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Dutch diplomat did not say who would misuse the war but it is widely believed that the North is a stronghold of the opposition represented in the elections by Museveni's key opponent, Dr. Paul Ssemogerere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If five districts (in Northern Uganda) are excluded in the elections out of sheer necessity, then the legitimacy of the elected government will be in question,&quot; Mrs Linsen said in a press statement on April 15 which also urged the government to stop the war before the elections on May 9.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Netherlands charge d'affaires also announced a grant of US$1.2million to the Uganda Interim Electoral Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a separate development, the East, Southern and Central Africa Union of Muslim Councils has congratulated Libyan pilgrims to Mecca for having defied United Nations sanctions and flown to Saudi Arabia for the holy Hajj.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The sanctions are a violation of the freedom of worship for Libyan Muslims because they prevent them from fulfilling the holy Koran which says they must visit the holy place of Allah without seeking permission from an earthly authority including the UN,&quot; the Secretary General of the East, Southern and Central Africa councils of Muslims, Sheikh Abdu Sengoba said in a statement published at the body's head quarters here on April 17.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kikuyu, Kenya - Hundreds of mourners on April 15 converged at the Presbyterian Church of East Africa (PCEA) here, some 25 kilometres north-west of Nairobi, to lay to rest Retired Moderator of the PCEA General Assembly, the Very Rev. Crispus Kiongo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The late Kiongo, died on Easter Monday at the PCEA Kikuyu Hospital here aged 84.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A former student of the Protestant Churches Alliance High School, Kiongo trained as a teacher in the 30s and went on to Zanzibar to learn the Kiswahili language. He taught for 16 years, and was once an elected councillor for a local county council.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prior to working in the church ministry full time, the late Kiongo studied theology through correspondence and then joined Fort Hare university in South Africa. He was ordained Minister of the Word and Sacraments in 1953.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among religious highlights, was his appointment as moderator of the General Assembly of the PCEA for two terms between 1967 and 1973.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the third African moderator of the church, he steered the church with a lot of courage and devotion when the political wave in the country was unstable. He also served as a member of the National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) and chaired various departments of the council, key among them, the finance committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Delivering the sermon at the clergy's burial, the current PCEA General Assembly Moderator, Rt. Rev. Bernard Muindi, hailed the late Kiongo as a servant of God and all who like the apostle Paul could confidently say: &quot;I am being poured out like a drink offering. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muindi likened life to a journey whose beginning and end are obvious, but no-one knows what may happen in between. Only the sheer determination of the person to keep to the path one perceives to be straight will help, the current PCEA Moderator added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Messages of condolences were received from local and international church leaders including the Rt. Rev. David Gitari, Acting Archbishop of the Church of the Province of Kenya (CPK) and Rtd. Methodist Presiding Bishop Mbogori who both attended the ceremony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenya's President Daniel arap Moi and Vice- President George Saitoti also sent messages of condolence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The late Crispus Kiongo was buried at the PCEA Church of Torch, Thogoto, Kikuyu, a pioneer missionary ground where the remains of eminent members of the P.C.E.A. are interred. He is survived by a widow, several children and grandchildren.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London - A silent genocide continues in Rwanda today, two years on after interahamwe militia and Hutu extremists systematically hacked down, shot and blew up tens of thousands of Tutsis and Hutu moderates during the period of the Rwanda holocaust from April to July, 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms. Rukiya Omar of Africa Rights, a human rights advocate group based here, warns in a new report that most of those who perpetrated the genocide in Rwanda in 1994 are still at large - both within the country and outside.  Their agenda has not changed, she asserts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms. Omar has just completed a 91-page document entitled, &quot;Killing the Evidence,&quot; in which she details the activities of the extremists who actively hunt down and murder the survivors of the genocide particularly targeting Hutu witnesses to intimidate them into silence, even killing them to silence the evidence entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is the invisible genocide that still continues, overlooked by most Rwandese and by all international organisations&quot;, says Omar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Killing the Evidence&quot; documents the extent of the continuing violence - murder, attempted murder and intimidation - against survivors and witnesses.  Asserts Ms. Omar: &quot;The attacks detailed in this report are not isolated incidents; they are part of a broad pattern of violations intended to seal the genocide and ensure impunity for those who perpetrated it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The killers within Rwanda are so confident that they threaten survivors openly. She cited several cases including that of Juvenal Sibomana who lives in a suburb of Kigali called Kicukiro. He had some of the threatening leaflets thrust through his door which said in part, that a sharp pole would be thrust into his wife's legs up to her mouth. No survivor can afford to feel safe, says Omar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She warns that far too many people who are themselves implicated in the genocide continue to hold positions of responsibility in the civil service and local government structures. Others, both civilian and military, want to protect friends and relatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another disturbing aspect is that survivors in remote regions of Rwanda face relentless economic warfare. Their efforts to rebuild their shattered lives are being frustrated in every way possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms. Omar is critical of the world community for failing to help Rwanda rebuild its judiciary in order to expedite the trial of thousands of prisoners, locked up in Rwanda's jails in connection with the genocide of 1994.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monrovia - With youthful rebels on a cannibal rampage, Westerners are fleeing the anarchy in Liberia, a country abandoned by the West, writes Phillip van Niekerk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TWO-and-a-half weeks ago, soldiers overran the village north-west of Monrovia where Sensi Momoh lived. They were young, some no more than teenagers, and heavily armed. They fired at random and ransacked the huts.  &quot;They killed my brother,&quot; Momoh said. &quot;They opened up his body and took his heart out.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They put it in a big pan and cooked it in palm butter. Then they ate it. I've never seen such a thing. It was unbelievable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dozens of Liberians in refugee camps outside Monrovia described similar acts of cannibalism, believed to endow those who partake with supernatural powers. One woman had seen young warriors of Alhaji GV Kromah's United Liberation Movement (Ulimo-K) extract the heart and private parts of five boys and eat them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While his youthful supporters, crazed by the combination of home-grown dagga and easy access to the spoils of war, terrorised the countryside, Kromah sat on the Council of State in Monrovia, the governing body created last year as the centrepiece of the international community's now hopelessly thwarted attempt to restore order to chaotic Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would be unfair to single out any one leader of Liberia's warring factions, as all are guilty --- of outright atrocities or at best of failing to control their legions of young soldiers. &quot;None of us has clean hands,&quot; admitted Franois Masikwa, leader of one of the smaller factions, the Lofa Defence Force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Everyone with a big gun gets to sit on the council,&quot; complained Masikwa, whose relatively small faction had won him only the lowly sport ministry portfolio. In creating the council, the Abuja Accord divvied up the government among the very warlords whose troops had nearly destroyed it.  Whether out of despair or a desire for a quick fix, the international community --- including the United Nations and the United States --- acquiesced. &quot;The international community blundered by allowing a government of criminals that defies all norms of civilisation,&quot; said Koffi Woods, of the Catholic Justice and Peace Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The aim of the accord, brokered in August, was to maintain Monrovia as a weapon-free zone while the rest of the country was disarmed. Troops from the West African peacekeeping force manned scores of roadblocks in and out of the city to ensure that it remained a &quot;safe haven&quot;. One reason given by the warlord Charles Taylor for moving in to arrest his rival Roosevelt Johnson a week ago, the spark that started the war, was that he was sitting on a weapons stockpile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The failure of the Abuja Accord was the assumption that the warlords wanted peace. War has always been a means of gaining great wealth. In the post-Cold War world, rebel militias fight more for plunder than for any ideology. Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia, for one, is in the business of selling diamonds and exporting hardwoods and rubber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why the warlords bartered for peace at all may be because they had stolen whatever there was to steal in the countryside. Even as the government caved in, first prize in Liberia was still to become the biggest of the big men. Taylor has never made secret his ambition to be president. Twice before he attempted to take Monrovia: twice he was blocked by the Nigerian peacekeeping troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There can be no doubt that the assault on Johnson's home was his third attempt to seize power. It was how Johnson saw it when interviewed on the eve of the storming. &quot;This is a set-up. The National Patriotic Front is trying to create a smokescreen for its evil plans. Taylor wants to be president.&quot; It was his last public statement. Taylor's forces attacked 36 hours later and Johnson has not been seen since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The peace accord empowered Taylor by handing over to him key functions of the already weakened Liberian state. He was given the police --- which he rapidly turned into an adjunct of his militia --- and the justice ministry, which he padded with his own appointees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taylor also got the information and tourism ministries. Journalists entering Monrovia were forced to buy accreditation for $30, money pocketed immediately by the official on duty. Nor was it useful; word was out that anyone found by Johnson's people to have such a document would be killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was no small irony in Taylor attempting to charge Johnson with murder, given his own bloody record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today Monrovia is ruled by its young soldiers of misfortune, with their red scarfs, dark glasses and AK-47s. Looting is a source of income for youths doomed otherwise to joblessness and life on the margins. One of the UN observers in Monrovia calculated that with an estimated 60 000 combatants, each with at least three dependants, there are about 200 000 people in Liberia who benefit from looting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taylor's troops in particular are noted for indiscipline. They led the population on a free-for-all through central Monrovia, carrying chairs, TVs and computers on their heads, or pushing wheelbarrows stuffed with food and clothes, while the peacekeepers stood back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johnson had the backing of the Krahn ethnic group, which included former Liberian soldiers located at the Barclay Training Centre, as well as the troops of George Boley's Liberia Peace Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Refugees at displaced people's centres outside Monrovia told of a merciless process of &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; that has been under way in western Liberia since January. Kromah's Mandingo have been pitted against Johnson's Krahn, both factions of Ulimo. Members of the smaller ethnic groups have been killed, their villages looted and burnt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, I picked my way over the bodies of Liberians littering the streets of Monrovia. Mortar and RPG-7 rocket fire could be heard in repeated barrages as the Krahn held on grimly to the barracks, with hundreds of hostages packed in as human shields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A city already bursting with refugees from the war in the countryside has created tens of thousands of its own internal refugees. A humanitarian disaster is in the making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The image that remains is of women, quiet with hunger, holding crying babies, watching helicopters overhead, en route to convey Westerners to safety. Their eyes seemed to be asking the same question: will they ever come back, or is Liberia to be abandoned to its fate?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American officials said yesterday that the round-the-clock military airlift has carried more than 1 500 people of 62 nationalities out of Monrovia, but more people were still seeking refuge at the US embassy. &quot;We were down to the last 70 people in the compound and now they've let a lot more in,&quot; Commander Robert Anderson said. &quot;We've been told we'll need about a dozen more sorties.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, D.C. - Summit speech by Wole Soyinka, &quot;Towards a Sustainable Vision of Nigeria&quot; (Excerpts)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The army is a creation, and a property of the people. It is established to serve and to defend the people and safeguard their nation space. Even where nations have come into being as a fruit of conquest, such histories have proved to be ephemeral, incomplete. A cycle of restitution has merely been initiated, one that will become complete only when the people, the authentic constituents of the nation entity, recover their own being, melt down the power-spawned aliens in their midst into the common purpose of existence and redraw the lines of relationship along egalitarian precepts.  This process of reckoning is not peculiar to any one part of the globe - we read the authentic history of the world today in many of the infernoes that have engulfed once placid states, exploded even centuries-old mythifications that have sustained alienated power. The only question that remains is: are we prepared to take our instruction from these incontestable patterns of socio-political being of nations? Or do we wait until a Rwanda, a Yugoslavia or a Chechnya blows up in our complacent faces?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria appears, alas, to be poised on the brink of the latter option.  If we have a purpose here today, it is to address our collective minds to methods for the avoidance of that option. ... Obviously, there will be differences in our concepts of approaches to solutions but, it is our expectation that those who are assembled here are agreed on a number of minimal principles, the very core of which is the rapid termination, not merely of the existence of the present bunch of military predators, but of military interventionism in Nigeria for all time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I believe that we have agreed to assemble here because we can neither understand nor accept the contradictory motions of the political class, its collaborationist approach with those who have placed our people under the most brutal subjugation in our history as Nigerians, as earlier defined. We are appalled by the failure of understanding of the enemy that leads to a gathering of the political class actually appointing a 2l-man delegation to request audience with a military junta in order to discuss how such a junta - which has shown such stark, contemptuous resolve to remain in power- can be persuaded to leave. Needless to say, this approach was publicly derided by the junta's yes-men, and the emissaries thoroughly humiliated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I believe that we have agreed to meet here because, between the five-year transition plan of Sani Abacha, dishonestly described as a three-year plan, and the one-year transition plan outlined by Chief Tony Enahoro, the Vice-President of the National Democratic Coalition of Nigeria, we believe that the latter respresents the absolute, outside temporal concession that we are prepared to make towards the military, and that we would indeed prefer that the military depart today, hand over power to the President-elect who would run a transition goveratment of National Unity, leading to the next elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I believe that we have agreed to assemble here because we recognise that there cannot be peace in that nation, Nigeria, while a former Head of State, General Olusegun Obasanjo, his former deputy Shehu Yar'Adua, Beko Ransome-Kuti, chairman of the Campaign for Democracy, Chris Anyawu, Colonel Gwadabe and scores of others are held under sentences of long years in prison, after universally denounced secret trials for a coup attempt that was manufactured by the present junta in order to rid itself of perceived opponents and champions of the democratic movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have consented to be present here because Frank Kokori secretary-general of the Petroleum workers union, and hundreds of trade unionists from all the nation's productive sectors are incarcerated in different corners of the nation, without trial, without contact with their families, accused of no crime but agitating for social, political and economic justice. We are here because we will not accept a dispensation that permits the torture of our kind, the hostage taking of relations of wanted opponents of govemment, state inspired murders and attempted murders of Chief Alfred Rewane, Alex Ibru, Gani Fawehinmi etc. We have set ourselves our present task because we cannot accept that the President-elect of the Nigerian nation, Moshood M.K.O. Abiola, should be kept from executing the freely given mandate of the Nigerian people. We are assembled because we are resolved to unearth the bones of seventy-three non-commissioned officers who were secretly executed near Abuja, at the Lower Usman dam on March 18, 1994, soldiers whose names were added to the list of fatalities and &quot;Missing in Action&quot; in Liberia and other areas where our peace-keeping forces are in action. We propose to demonstrate that our soldiers do not deserve such cynical treachery nor their profession be reduced to such a costly and cynical travesty of command.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are here because we seek to build a nation where such dark deeds are no longer permitted, are no longer conceivable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the process, we believe that we have a responsibility to inform the outside world that those who wish to impose a double standard in their consideration of our plight, those who take sadistic pleasure in reducing us to second class citizens of the world, are enemies of all humanity, yellow, black and white.  Along the way, we must remind the apologists of the Abacha regime, especially our own black brothers from the United States of America, that they are traitors to their own history, and captives of a chronic slave mentality.  That any self-declared leader of the black peoples of the United States of America should declare, in the dying years of the twentieth century that the most populous black nation in the world requires the plague of dictatorship for its progress, even for its very existence, simply warns us that emancipation is a mere word, a mere rhetorical condition to a handful of demagogic representatives of our race on that continent. It warns us that emancipation as the profound state of being, as the true, mental and spiritual condition of free being, is alien to their conceptual powers. Given the chance, such spokesmen and women would collaborate in the second enslavement of our continent, in order to experience the vicarious thrill of power. Let all those who wine and dine with our oppressors, who trumpet virtues of dictatorship that exist only in their own sated bellies remember that some day, this struggle will be over, and that history will assign them their richly deserved spaces in the records of our liberated peoples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our task here is not to produce an agreement in all details of strategy, but we shall not leave without a definite plan of action, one that is time-specific. We do not intend, in a mere two days, to weld together differing philosophies and visions of the participating groups, yet we are duty bound to create a unified body for the democratic forces of the nation.  We are obliged to search out what each group does best, so that we can launch the new organisation on its task of assigning responsibilities that correspond to their past records and future potential. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let me thank our hosts for this meeting, made possible by the non-governmental South Africa-Nigeria Democracy Support Group. History often commences not with a flourish, not with bravura, but with the small gesture, often indeed, a mere statement of intent. If this meeting does no more than galvanise and unity ihe progressive forces of our nation, reduce their sense of aloneness, of abandonment, it would still be a psychological shot in the arm, whose concrete results will become apparent only after the event. To be a visionary is unfashionable we know, in the sphere of realpolitick, and the task is made even more utopian when any grouping seeks to identity and structure, among others, a practical, sustainable vision. For a nation that has sunk so low however, one that has squandered its potential in a way that criminalises almost every citizen by the mere act of belonging, we have nothing left to lose but the loftiness of our vision. That vision, a sustainable one, must inform the laying of the foundations of a new Nigeria.  It is a project that will commence at this and at its twin meeting, and the people of South Africa will have cause to be proud, at the end, to have midwifed such a beginning.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, D.C. - The United Democratic Front of Nigeria (UDFN) is a common platform of pro-democracy organizations which, following simultaneous meetings (Nigerian Pro-Democracy Summit) in South Africa (Johannesburg) and in Europe (Oslo, Norway) on March 29-31, 1996, resolved to work together to effectively harness and facilitate activities toward the restoration of democracy in Nigeria on the basis of the popular mandate of June 12th, 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> RESTARTING THE NATION CLOCK Communique from the Nigerian Pro-Democracy Summit March 29th - 31st, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PREAMBLE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria has been in political turmoil since June 12th 1993 when the military government of General Ibrahim Babangida annulled a democratically conducted presidential election</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The transition program was designed and executed by the military regime under General Ibrahim Babangida whose defense minister and de facto second-in-command was General Sani Abacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The presidential election of June 12th 1993 was adjudged by Nigerian and international observers as the freest and fairest in Nigeria's history.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Babangida regime illegally imposed on Nigerians an &lt;&lt;Interim National Government&gt;&gt; headed by Chief Ernest Shonekan with General Sani Abacha as Vice Chairman rather than accept the will of the people as expressed in the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Subsequently, General Abacha illegally seized power on November 17th 1993 and dissolved all legislatures that had been duly elected at the local, state and federal levels under the military's transition program, and reinstated full military rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Abacha has since June 1994, placed in detention Chief M.K.O.  Abiola, the president-elect, on charges of treason, for claiming his mandate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Abacha regime has prevented president-elect Abiola from communicating with the outside world, including his immediate family, as a means of forcing Abiola to renounce the mandate given to him by the Nigerian people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In spite of many well-meaning initiatives, the Abacha regime has scorned all appeals by the international community for respect for human rights and a speedy return of Nigeria to democratic civil rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Abacha is intimidating Nigerians and deceiving the international community into accepting ANOTHER transition program similar to the one he and Babangida reneged on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Therefore, Abacha's three year transition program is an excuse to prolong his stay in power. It is fraught with dangers and threatens further chaos and violence. It is a deliberate waste of time and resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly, Abacha's plan to create more states in Nigeria under this bogus transition program is a desperate attempt to divert people's attention from the real social, economic and political problems facing the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The real and primary incentive for the Abacha regime's insistence on power is oil revenue which the regime is looting to the detriment of the majority of Nigerians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Abacha regime has orchestrated a reign of barbaric terror on the people of Nigeria, tragically illustrated by the state murder of Ken Saro-Wiwa and other Ogoni human rights and environmental activists. Further more, every institution of civilized society in Nigeria has been systematically destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abacha's rule has been characterized by institutionalized anarchy, corruption, economic decline and gross human rights abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Therefore, the limited sanctions imposed on Nigeria by the U.S. and the European Union have not been effective in forcing Abacha and his regime either to bow to the wishes of the people as expressed in the presidential election of June 12th 1993, or to respect the basic standards of international behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DECLARATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We, the pro-democracy organizations listed below, having deliberated in our simultaneous meetings in South Africa and in Europe, hereby resolve to work together under a common platform (United Democratic Front of Nigeria, UDFN) to effectively harness and facilitate our activities toward the restoration of democracy in Nigeria on the basis of the popular mandate of June 12th, 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The immediate task of the Government of National Unity to be so formed is to call a Sovereign National Conference whose main task is to preside over the restoration of full democratization in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Further, we resolve that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. we reject in its entirety the 3-year transition program of the Abacha dictatorship in Nigeria;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. any actions including the creation of states and the conduction of elections under the illegal Abacha regime shall be null and void;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. the only moral, just and lasting solution to the Nigerian crisis is respect for the mandate of the Nigerian people as expressed in elections prior to and including the June 12th 1993, presidential elections;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. We appeal to all people of conscience all over the world to insist on respect for the will of the people of Nigeria as expressed in elections prior to and including the presidential elections of June 12th, 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. We call on Nigerians at home to boycott any new elections and to take measures to establish parallel zones of authority at local levels to deny any legitimacy to Abacha's transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. We demand that all political prisoners in Nigeria be released immediately and without conditions, and also that president-elect M.K.O.  Abiola be released to form a broad-based Government of National Unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 7. We call on the international community to impose oil embargo and full economic, cultural and sporting isolation on Nigeria until democracy is restored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 8. We call on all governments, the UN, OAU, EU and non-governmental organizations to desist from giving the Abacha dictatorship any semblance of legitimacy by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a) Not providing any financial, logistic or other support for Abacha's illegal elections;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> b) Not sending any observers to his shambolic elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 9. We strongly advise all governments, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other international financial institutions not to negotiate any further debt rescheduling or grant any new loans to the Abacha regime, as the future legitimate government of Nigeria will not be compelled to honor such agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 10. We request all governments to freeze all the assets of members of the miitary junta and their civilian collaborators.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Managing director Austin Mweemba said in Mpika yesterday that the workers have been reinstated on condition that they returned to work immediately.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reinstatement follows the intervention of Northern Province deputy minister Daniel Kapapa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, labour minister Newstead Zimba accused the Zambia Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) of inciting the work stoppage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;ZCTU did not examine the issue critically to advise the workers,&quot; Zimba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said his ministry was still awaiting a report from the ministry of communication and transport under which TAZARA falls. The workers were on a week long strike demanding a 150 per cent wage increment but management offered them only five per cent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Members of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, COMESA, have agreed that Structural Adjustment Pro-grammes (SAP) have drastically affected their economies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a meeting of the COMESA inter-governmental committee which ended yesterday, representatives of the member countries discussed the ever- worsening position of the African countries in international trade.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was observed that SAPs in COMESA countries are being hastily implemented thus leading to some loopholes being left unsealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A report on the meeting also revealed that foreign businessmen are taking advantage of these loopholes to grab the markets leaving local industries with nothing to hold on to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have lauded countries such as Uganda for successful implementation of SAP, there is growing concern that the victims of progress, that is, those made redundant and others left unemployed because of the scarcity of jobs, might present another problem of great social consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was felt that a lot of local business initiatives are dying out in the face of stiff competition from well established foreign companies entering the market with the added advantage of incentives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Domestic production in the region has been reduced and there have been acute shortages of food necessitating high imports which have been a major drain on scarce foreign exchange reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting adopted corrective measures which will be announced in a report from the COMESA ministers' meeting which starts today.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Minister of Finance Ronald Penza finally broke his silence on the depreciation of the Kwacha yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking on ZNBC television, Penza cited three causes for the depreciation of the kwacha.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Penza said the continued low copper production figures, maize purchases made late last year and early this year, and the slow disbursements of donor funds had depressed the country's foreign exchange reserves and has contributed to the ongoing inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the minister said it was the usual pattern at the beginning of the year and that the benchmarks set by the International Monetary Fund would be met by May while the World Bank is currently preparing to approve a disbursement of funds which will solve the balance of payments problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The minister assured the nation that these developments would soon stabilise the Kwacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And commercial banks are reporting a stabilisation of the kwacha against the dollar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the Barclays Bank weekly newsletter, this week has seen commercial banks' rates move in the range of K1,217 - K1,230 for buying and K1,255 - K1,270 for selling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Internationally, the dollar remained steady against the Deutchmark but the Rand last week continued its downward trend against the dollar, having depreciated by almost 14 per cent since February and went down a further two per cent this week. Financial analysts in South Africa said the depreciation has prompted some foreign investors to sell their bonds and equities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, dealers are optimistic that investors will be enticed back once the Rand has stabilised.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) are the new inclusion in the legal suit against the state to be filed by the &quot;Gabon air disaster families&quot; next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a letter to FAZ, dated April 16, 1996 informing them of the impending suit from the families' lawyers, Central Chambers and Andrea Masiye and Company, FAZ, like the state, is being sued for negligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FAZ is also alleged to have assured the players and officials that the plane was fit to fly to Senegal despite knowing very well that it had given problems when they (players and officials) flew on it to Mauritius.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This accident occurred due to the negligence of your agents or servants in choosing a mode of transportation on a vehicle which was not airworthy and in a fit state of repair and maintainance,&quot; reads part of the letter to FAZ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our clients, claim is also based on the fact you ought to have known after the trip to Mauritius that the Zambia Air Force plane was not airworthy. Your assurances to the players, coaches and newsman that the said transport was reliable and safe, was acted upon in good faith by the team to their detriment,&quot; continues the letter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FAZ has also been asked to state if there was any insurance cover for the players and officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But when contacted, FAZ acting general secretary Julio Chiluba declined to be drawn into discussing the matter, and could neither confirm nor deny receiving the letter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't want to involve myself in that matter, if anything, I am not aware that the widows intend to sue the government,&quot; Chiluba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The letter warned that if no indication of acceptance of liability on the part of FAZ is shown, legal action will proceed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In another letter to the Attorney General, the lawyers requested him to confirm with Zambia Air Force if the plane had any insurance cover, and the names and addresses of the insurers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Attorney General George Chilupe could not be reached for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The families are claiming damages under the law Reforms, Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1934, on behalf of the estates of the deceased and damages under the fatal Accidents Acts 1846 to 1956 on behalf of dependants of the said deceased in consequence of the death of the said deceased.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Sugar queues continued in Lusaka yesterday following an unexplained shortage which has hit the capital city for the past three days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Zambia Sugar Company insists the shortage is normal and temporary.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Post snap survey revealed that sugar had become a very sought after commodity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At Fairworth Supermarket on Cairo Road, there was a scramble for sugar and the shop manager said his normal stock was sold in less than 30 minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I had my very normal stocks of sugar but I was surprised it sold out in a matter of minutes, and people still wanted to hang around here even after I announced to them it was finished,&quot; revealed the shop manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And he asked Zambia Sugar Company to explain the sudden shortage to avert hoarding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Zambia Sugar Company managing director David Covell yesterday maintained there is plenty of sugar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is just a temporary thing, in fact I can say, the old crop has been finished, and we are starting on a new crop which we started harvesting last week Monday,&quot; Covell said. &quot;It is normal to experience shortages during transitions from old crop to new crop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But street vendors and marketeers are now profiteering from the shortage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I bought in bulk yesterday at Kamwala and Shoprite Checkers and I am selling at a profit, the 2Kg is K2,600 and I bought it at K1,900&quot; boasted street vendor Abraham Chipeta.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Lottie Mwale has attacked present professional boxers who he claimed exhibited incompetence at the recent Aupie Promotions tournament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former African and Commonwealth light heavyweight champion, who had travelled to Kabwe's Railway ground for the tournament, said he was not happy with the boxing skills displayed by most boxers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As a former boxer, I will discourage them (boxers) from surging ahead with international title fights because they have no ability to stand the competition,&quot; observed Mwale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He singled out national lightweight champion, Felix 'The Hammer'' Bwalya, whom he advised to have at least three serious local fights before embarking on his Commonwealth title bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bwalya is set for a go at the Commonwealth title held by Paul Ryan of Britain this June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He can be a good boxer but what it is important is that he must train very hard before thinking of the Commonwealth title,&quot; suggested Mwale.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Zambia Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) has warned that this year's expected bumper harvest may go to waste if government does not get involved involved in its marketing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As ZCTU, we feel government must be involved in maize marketing because our farmers can lose out from some private marketing agents whose only interest is making money,&quot;warned ZCTU general secretary Alec Chirwa in an interview in Kitwe yesterday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He suggested that government meets the Zambia National Farmers Union to see how best to help market the maize in a way that both the farmers and the marketing agents will be happy with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chirwa disclosed that this is not the first time ZCTU was appealing to the government to improve the maize marketing system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chirwa, who disclosed that &quot;Last year ZCTU approached finance minister, Ronald Penza, health minister Michael Sata and labour minister Newstead Zimba to try and find ways of creating a better marketing system,&quot; Chirwa said.  &quot;But regrettably nothing has been done.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The interim Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) executive committee members recently met secretly to change the dates of the general elections which have been set for May 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the move is believed to be a plan to prolong their stay at Anchor House so as to pave way for their eventual election at the FAZ polls whose date they will decide at their will.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FAZ interim treasurer, Musa Kasonka, however refuted the claims that the election dates have been changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is not true that we have changed the election dates, we cannot do that because it would be illegal. And whoever thinks we are trying to change the dates so as to prolong our stay is not being fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Apart from George Kasengele, no one else is standing in the next FAZ elections,&quot; Kasonka said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But sources insist that the one FAZ member not standing is Ahmed Ponder, who indicated that he was only willing to help out in the interim committee after which he will return to his Kafue base, while the rest including chairman, Michael Chiti are standing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The change in the election dates is the second after earlier polls which were originally set for April 13 were pushed to May 4.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - A Chinese promotional agency has offered the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) US$50,000 to let the national soccer team travel to China for a series of friendly matches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to documents sent to FAZ by Golden Promotional Agency, FAZ has been asked to send the national team that clinched a third position at the Africa Cup of Nations tournament that was held in South Africa last January.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We will pay US$50,000.00. for the Zambia national team that went and finished number three at the Africa Cup of Nations held in South Africa in January, we will also pay all other expenses that may have to be paid for the team,&quot; reads part of the fax message sent to FAZ offices dated March 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But when approached for an official comment and position on the Chinese offer, acting FAZ general secretary, Julio Chiluba, suggested that the issue be handled at a later stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As at now, I cannot confirm or deny that such an offer has come up. But you can wait maybe for some time,&quot; suggested Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Chinese have offered to host the friendly matches after Zambia plays her first leg of the World cup Africa qualifiers match against Sudan in June.  The faxed message indicated July 3rd and 6th as the dates for the friendly matches against the Chinese national team.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Sports minister, Patrick Kamumukache, has admitted that Zambia is still using out-dated boxing act and promised to modernise it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia has been using boxing regulations passed over by the British settler rule in 1964.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Kafumukache explained that the amendments in the Zambia Professional Boxing and Wrestling Board of Control (ZPBWC) will take some time because of the on-going re-structuring at the National Sports Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am very much aware that we have a very serious problem with our boxing rules and we have an urgent need to amend everything to suit the present state of boxing,&quot;admitted Kamufukache in an interview last Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the news that the Boxing Act is to be amended has cheered many in boxing circles though some wondered why it has taken the ministry five years to see wrongs in the present boxing Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have been using Boxing Act inherited from colonialists and it is good that now the minister is thinking of amending the act, we have to move with times. But I don't know why it has taken the minister five years to see that we are still far behind,&quot; said a promoter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Anglo Zambia managing director, Anderson Mazoka, Anglo has decided to focus its efforts on brewing, milling, and the mining industry.  Mazoka, however, refused to disclose the amount of money involved.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - It is not overstating things to say that we all live in an unequal world. This is true at the top of the rugby pile where George Orwell's contention that some are more equal than others freely applies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Certainly this is the type of thinking that prevails in England's top rugby circles where the sniff of TV millions has proved too much for the officials at Twickenham. They are demanding a far larger cut of the money generated from televised viewing of the Five Nations tournament than the other countries involved.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Poms are not alone. The Australians, down to play home-and-away tests against South Africa in the upcoming Sanzar series, are involved in litigation over the pay-for-view rights to the Wallaby internationals. The whole issue is a minefield of big money and high expectations, fighting the indignation of viewers who feel they have an inalienable right to watch their nation's sporting cream do battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The English have gone as far as to take the issue to parliament and ensure that specific events are not blacked out for those without satellite dishes, cable TV or decoders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whether this will work in rugby union is still a matter of de-bate. The pre-mise on which England's un-precedented demand is based is that the vast majority of viewers tune in to watch England in a series rapidly losing its mystique and relevance in world rugby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It beggars two questions. First, would they tune in at all if Scotland, Ireland and Wales decided not to field 15 men as good and true as are readily available to face the Poms? One would suggest that the majority of spectators from the other home nations have long been of the opinion that England should play with themselves anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And second, is it specifically for an England victory that they have tuned in? One would hazard a guess that this is not necessarily so and quote from perhaps the best sporting T- shirt currently available. It reads: &quot;I support two teams. Scotland and who-ever is playing England.&quot; Quite so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the England demands could have a more far- reaching effect than to merely entrench a dissatisfaction with the imperious way the English have always handled those for whom they coined such unsavoury names as Wops, Dagos, Paddies and Kikes. Nothing, it seems, has changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Insisting on filling the Twickenham coffers before anyone else gets a sniff of the gilt may well bring the Five Nations to an abrupt halt. It could also mean the end of the British Lions, one of rugby's more eccentric and enduring traditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Lions are slated to make a three-test tour of this country next year with internationals at Newlands on June 21, King's Park the following weekend and at Ellis Park seven days later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Should England stay with their demands --- fuelled doubtless by the growing demands of their clubs who want a more equitable share of the money coming into English rugby and a threatening breakaway from the arrogantly named Rugby Football Union --- do not hold your breath until the Lions arrive for their first game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would be an impossibility to expect a handful of Scots, Welshmen and Irishmen --- already paid far less by their unions than the English players --- to fit into a touring party with the wearers of the red rose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Orwellian outcome in terms of internal equality among the tourists would be akin to lighting the blue touchpaper and then refusing to retire.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nelson Mandela Inauguration Challenge has been billed as a clash of titans, a showdown between the champions of Africa and the champions of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But behind the hype, the match represents the greatest challenge to national coach Clive Barker and the footballers who became national heroes just two months ago by lifting the Nations' Cup.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bafana Bafana conquered Africa at the first attempt, defeating Cameroon, Angola, Algeria, Ghana and Tunisia to succeed Nigeria as holders of the most prized trophy on the continent. But once the euphoria of victory had subsided, the doubters were back in business claiming Nigeria would have crushed South Africa had they defended the title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Furious with President Mandela for taking a firm stand following the hanging of nine minority rights activists, Nigerian military ruler General Sani Abacha pulled the Super Eagles out of the tournament at the last minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another common cry of concern was that the South Africa team was too old and too slow with captian Neil Tovey (33) singled out as a footballer whose time had passed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others on or close to the 30 mark are midfielders Doctor Khumalo and John &quot;Shoes&quot; Moshoeu, and forward Mark Williams, two-goal hero of the Nations' Cup final triumph over Tunisia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Black Prince of South African football, Jomo Sono, has jumped on the bandwagon, saying places must be found for younger players after the Brazil match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But if the &quot;golden oldies&quot; perform as well against Brazil as they did throughout the Nations' Cup, they cannot be dropped. Besides, the queue of young pretenders is not exactly kilometres long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The age issue has been heightened by the fact that Brazil are bringing a squad containing Bebeto (32), Aldair (30) and 16 magicians, the oldest of whom required just 24 candles at his last birthday party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mario Zagalo took over as coach soon after Brazil won the World Cup a record fourth time in 1994 and quickly realised that most of the team would be too old when it came to defending the title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So he drafted in the pick of the young crop, who last month humiliated four-time African champions Ghana 8-2 near Sao Paulo with substitute Marques scoring a second-half hat- trick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Ghanaian team including Leeds United forward Anthony Yeboah must still be wondering what hit them in the second half as Brazil scored six times in a display of lightning speed and one-touch passing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One Ghanaian was carried off unconscious trying to prevent a goal and another was sent off after a kamikaze takle on Juninho, the only member of the victorious team not coming to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> European clubs are not obliged to release players for friendly matches, so Zagalo has been deprived of of Juninho from Middlesbrough ad Roberto Carlos and Caio of Inter Milan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am bringing to South Africa a team for today, and tomorrow,&quot; grey-haired Zagalo (63) says. &quot;This is a different team to the one that won the World Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We played the way we had to play in the United States and we won. Now we have changed things and we are playing the football we think we should be producing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barker welcomed the eight-goal destruction of Ghana, saying it would serve as a red light. &quot;But we will have home advantage and I do not believe we will panic and fall apart in the face of exceptional skills.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The Housing Ministry --- specifically its failure to deliver --- has come in for substantial criticism in the past year. So it was with obvious delight that Minister of Housing Sankie Mthembi-Nkondo turned the first sod at the launch of the Mhinga housing project in the Northern Province last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The R40-million project involves a few firsts. To date, what little housing development that has taken place has been based in urban areas; this one will provide 2 500 houses, initially, for a rural community. In addition, the land, bordering on the Kruger National Park, was reclaimed from the government for the tribal authority, and then converted for individual use on a freehold basis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With government slow to take the initiative, it was left to the private sector, in the form of Nedcor and Megacom, a developer, to bridge the gap.  Nedcor acted as facilitator between the government, the developer and tribal leader Hosi Mhinga, while Megacom set out to prove it was possible to build houses for R15 000 each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nedcor's Kevin Gibb says the bank's role is an inclusive one: &quot;Nedcor has for a long time realised that the private sector has to get involved and take risks if South Africa's housing problem is ever going to be solved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But we needed central and provincial government on board. In the housing minister and the director general of housing, Bobby Cobbett, we found the support we needed, which has to date proven to be the backbone of the initiative in many respects.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The project proves that government and the private sector can work hand-in-hand for the national good, says Gibb. And while the territory is unchartered for banks in general, Nedcor believes the financial sector can't stand by and wait for government to do everything, because it plainly cannot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mhinga project will be augmented by government's contribution to schools, clinics and infrastructure, such as sewage systems and roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The project lays great emphasis on boosting the economy of the area, where unemployment is rife. To this end, local labour --- mostly women as heads of households --- and local materials will be used. The potential for entrepreneurial development is enormous, says Mthembi-Nkondo. Of the R40-million initial outlay, R10-million will go back into the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She emphasised the need to stem the flow of people from rural to urban areas: &quot;Projects such as this one, where decent housing is provided and where, through the upliftment of the economy, there is hope for the future, will surely serve to discourage people from chancing the questionable promises held out by the bright, but deceptive lights of the cities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Megacom's Albert Nelissen has set a target of completing the first phase of 2 500 houses within nine months. Eventually, a further 15 000 units with the additional infrastructure and services, will be provided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He emphasises the need for functionality: roads will be paved with locally-made bricks, not tarred, so repairs are cheaper. And the bricks are moulded in such a way that they are easily laid, along the lines of building with lego.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such a project only became feasible once the housing legislation changed, says Gibb. Now the unemployed will receive a subsidy to cover the entire cost, while those who can pay, can take out a bond with Nedcor. So far, only 200 people in the area qualify for a mortgage, but housing the jobless is the project's first priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mpumalanga housing initiative, unveiled on Wednesday, contrasts with the Mhinga project in that it is a joint venture between Nedcor and local government. The province's premier, Matthew Phosa, opened a showcase village in Nelspruit, with similar initiatives planned for Secunda, Piet Retief, Barberton, Amsterdam and other towns in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The R500-million development aims to have 6 000 houses built within 18 to 24 months and bonds will be available to people with jobs, while the unemployed qualify for subsidies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Phosa also stressed the ripple effect of such a project for the economy as a whole: &quot;Our people must see the entrepreneurial opportunities which now present themselves, for example, the provision of building bricks, window and door frames, roof trusses and many other items required in such building projects. Innovative local people should jump at this opportunity to start their own businesses.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The great seven-year haggling game between divergent interest groups around the establishment of a regulated bond market appears at last to be moving towards a resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week the Bond Market Association (BMA) submitted its application to the Financial Services Board (FSB) to be licensed as South Africa's bond market exchange. The FSB is expected to grant a licence next month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To be called the Bond Exchange (and probably referred to as Bondex), this will be South Africa's third official exchange --- the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) trades equities and the South African Futures Exchange (Safex) trades futures and options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bonds are currently traded on both the JSE and between banks in an over the counter (informal) market in a ludicrious situation where bond transactions are settled anywhere up to two weeks after the deal, compared with the international norm of three days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also, until recently, traders have not had to comply with any capital adequacy requirements. The Capital Adequacy Directive for securities trading firms has now been introduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last October the BMA introduced electronic settlement that includes delivery and clearance mechanisms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All this makes for a more secure and transparent, hence more liquid and efficient, bond market. It will also result in better data on the size and profile of South Africa's bond market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A formal bond market will have major implications for futures and options trade in South Africa. The world over, volumes in fixed-interest futures dwarf those of equity futures. Not in South Africa where the lack of a formal, regulated bond market exchange has prevented trade in bond futures.  Safex's three equity-linked futures contracts account for more than 95% of Safex's total trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The BMA hopes to introduce exchange traded options. At present, all bond options are traded over the counter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There will probably be three fixed-interest futures contracts listed on Safex --- in the five-year, 10-year and long-term areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The BMA reckons bond volumes in 1995 totalled R2 326-billion (R1 821-billion in 1994). The first three months of 1996 saw R940-billion traded, 8% accounted for by foreigners (7% in 1995). Bondex will list some 464 bonds from 12 issuers, the largest being government. Other major issuers include Eskom, Transnet, the Post Office, Development Bank, Land Bank, etcetera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trade in government bonds accounts for 80% of the market, the most dominant being the long R150 and R153 stocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The BMA expects to issue 70 to 80 seats (it presently has 70 members) at R65 000. But in June this will be increased to R125 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has six categories of members --- issuers, insurers (only two), commercial banks, trading banks, JSE brokers (with 28 this is the largest grouping) and other smaller operators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the JSE moving towards automated screen trade, probably making its existing trading floor obsolete, Bondex could be the last remaining trading floor in South Africa. But it, too, will eventually move towards automated screen trade. At present, some 25% of bond trading volume is done on the floor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The rand retreated from its record lows this week, no thanks to Trevor Manuel's insistence that the government's position on exchange controls remains firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The finance minister is labouring the point, said one economist. He should have made suitably reassuring noises at the onset of the crisis, and then let the markets get on with it. &quot;The more you say exchange controls won't be lifted, the more the market expects the opposite. After all, it was proven correct on Chris Liebenberg's resignation.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And while some big bang proponents think the time is still ripe to act on controls --- with the rand so low there is less to lose, runs the argument --- there is a growing belief that the opportunity has been lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the government had acted two months ago, when the rand was trading in the late R3,90 range to the dollar, the effect of liberalisation would have been a certain depreciation, but then a rebound as foreign investors took advantage of the cheap currency and reinvested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, with the prospects for a rand recovery diminishing rapidly and the threat of liberalisation at some time still hanging like the sword of Damocles over the market, investors are adopting a wait-and-see attitude. The currency could tumble further - -- a R5 exchange rate is not entirely fanciful --- and they are unlikely to buy into this economy only to see the value of their capital dwindle if and when controls are lifted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's structural problems are coming home to roost, says Asghar Adelzadeh of the National Institute for Economic Policy. High interest rates are necessary to maintain the capital inflows, which in turn are needed to offset the current account deficit. This trade imbalance, combined with dwindling reserves, is adding to the currency's woes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Short-term capital made up 80% of the total inflows between 1980 and 1994; the economy pays for it in the form of interest on government bonds, unlike investment capital. Having to find these funds adds to market uncertainty, Adelzadeh adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Dennis Dykes of Nedcor says whatever the size of the reserves, a confidence crisis will spark a run on the currency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What we need now is a period of consolidation, if only on technical grounds, as the market realises the crash has been overdone. After two runs, a stabilisation is typical, and the rand is showing signs of firming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How long it lasts is anybody's guess.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - For a dozen years now, two bands have been constants on South Africa's popular music scene: Sankomota and Bayete. That's why the death of four Sankomota members in a road accident last weekend was so shocking --- for most fans of African music, it was as if a family member had died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Warric Sony --- who, as part of Shifty Music facilitated the band's first recording --- spoke for many when he expressed his sorrow: &quot;It's tragic that South Africa has lost so much of its musical talent on our roads. Fans need to remember that to bring them music, performers often have to work under literally killing conditions.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The four were Patrick &quot;Bushy&quot; Mogamme, guitarist Keith &quot;Butana&quot; Matshela, singer Mandisa Galo and Joman Tlali --- and while they were not the longest-established band members (that honour belongs to founder Frank Leepa), they had added much to the distinctive character of the band's recent live performances, and to its last album, the 1993 After the Storm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sankomota's sound has worn many faces over the years, reflecting Leepa's own musical development and the changing personnel he worked with. The first album, the 1983 Sankomota, was recorded by the original band in Lesotho, with what was then almost the entire Shifty stable of horns, reeds and other assorted instruments added later in Johannesburg. That album established the bedrock of the band's character; themes derived from the Basotho folk tradition and given a streetwise, highly aware musical treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other albums followed: the optimistic Dreams Do Come True, the more grimly realistic The Writing's on the Wall, and, in 1991, Exploration: A New Phase. During this period Tshepo Tshola (The Village Pope) provided characteristic soaring, almost preacherly vocals, while Mandla Masuku's saxophone flavoured the live shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the Storm marked a break: a return to more folk-influenced sounds and more contemplative, poetic lyrics, as well as a growing awareness of the pan-African musical dimension. At the time of the accident, Leepa and his colleagues were working on the sixth album, which, says manager Judy Henshall, &quot;will be a memorial to their work, but also a symbol that Sankomota survives&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Far from Nelson Mandela's trailblazing call last year for sanctions against Nigeria, South Africa was trying this week to pull the teeth from a United Nations resolution which slams the West African country's human rights record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Department of Foreign Affairs acknowledges it is withholding support for the resolution until it is watered down, but argues that this is the best strategy to get consensus among African, Asian and Latin-American countries - -- which will increase the chances of the European Union-sponsored resolution being adopted by the United Nations Human Rights Commission, which is meeting for its annual session in Geneva.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said Jackie Selebi, South Africa's ambassador to the UN mission in Geneva: &quot;We have taken the view that we should make a contribution to a position where African countries can for the first time get consensus on an issue that involves (Nigeria).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is a far cry from Mandela's adventurous call for oil sanctions against Nigeria immediately after the hanging last November of minority rights activist Ken Saro-Wiwa. His stance was lauded --- though not heeded --- by many in the West, but African countries made it clear they were not amused by what they saw as Mandela's disregard for African solidarity. South Africa's position in Geneva appears to be final confirmation that Foreign Affairs has gone with the African concern, and will no longer act alone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Negotiations to water down the resolution coincide with a visit by Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo to London for a meeting this weekend of the Commonwealth &quot;Committee of Eight&quot;. The committee, of which Nzo is a member, was established by the Commonwealth at its annual heads of state meeting in New Zealand last November to look at human rights abuses in Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Gambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Part of the committee's mandate was to visit Nigeria on a fact-finding mission, but so far Nigerian dictator General Sani Abacha has refused them entry on the grounds that it interferes with his country's sovereignty. The London meeting is likely to have to decide on a response to that rebuff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ironically, the part of the EU resolution South Africa wants removed has the same theme: another world probe into Nigeria's human rights situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A draft version of the resolution which the EU wants the plenary session of the UN Human Rights Commission to endorse says, among other things, that it is &quot;deeply concerned about the human rights situation in Nigeria&quot;. It calls for a range of human rights to be guaranteed and for Nigeria to take &quot;immediate and concrete steps to restore democratic government&quot;. It also calls for the appointment of a UN special rapporteur to &quot;examine the human rights situation in Nigeria&quot; and to report to the UN General Assembly and Human Rights Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Selebi said this week African countries believed sending a special rapporteur to Nigeria would be &quot;an overdose&quot; at a time when the Commonwealth mission was pending, while UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali had his own &quot;goodwill mission&quot; in Nigeria this month, and while Nigeria itself has said it will consider accepting UN &quot;thematic rapporteurs&quot; who will report to the UN on specific issues, such as torture or freedom of speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;African countries don't like a special rapporteur; in fact not any country likes a special rapporteur,&quot; he said. A special rapporteur is seen as having very wide powers and as being &quot;difficult to remove from the agenda&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Selebi said EU negotiators had given South Africa a broad outline of the resolution some weeks ago and asked for support, but did not present a full draft version. A copy of the draft was later &quot;smuggled&quot; to him. &quot;We looked at it, and consulted our colleagues from Africa. It was clear there would be no support for it unless at least a number of African governments could identify with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If that happened, some Asian and Latin- American countries would support it, which will increase its chances of succeeding ... As it is, it won't succeed with the special rapporteur.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Selebi pointed out that a &quot;weaker&quot; resolution on Nigeria adopted by the UN last December was co-sponsored by only four African countries, including South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Foreign Affairs source said this week South Africa's regional partners in the Southern African Development Community had made it clear at the body's pre-Christmas summit that South Africa &quot;had to do things on a regional basis&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That the criticism was taken to heart --- and that it became a strong theme in foreign policy --- appears from the fact that South Africa, and Mandela, fell silent on Nigeria this year. Earlier this month there were allegations that South Africa had tried to discourage a meeting of Nigerian opposition groups in the country, inter alia by not issuing visas timeously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In other matters concerning individual countries --- such as the crisis in Swaziland, where pro-democracy and labour groups have asked for South African help --- Foreign Affairs has also said repeatedly it would only act in conjunction with its regional partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Raks Seakhoa, chair of the South Africa- Nigeria Democracy Support Group, said: &quot;We want to ensure every pressure is applied, including that of rapporteur ... While we understand you have to pull the slower soldier with you, we will not be happy if that does not succeed and we as a country are seen as folding our arms.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Kempton Park-style horse trading between the African National Congress and the National Party over the last week is sealing disputes over the Bill of Rights, prompting criticism the two parties together have retreated from the interim Constitution and watered down fundamental rights for the new South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a flurry of bilaterals this week, the ANC and the NP moved towards resolution on problem clauses, aiming for an agreement by deadline Friday --- an agreement which effectively excludes the smaller parties such as the Democratic Party, the Pan Africanist Congress and the Freedom Front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While ANC negotiator Willie Hofmeyr praised progress between parties, saying that &quot;the people in the ANC and the NP buckled down to the deadline, were prepared to bite the bullet and engage in give and take&quot;, the DP is disappointed that the NP did not support it against the ANC on a number of points of principle, particularly on the limitations clause and property rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DP MP Dene Smuts said this week: &quot;South Africa deserves better than to have the last few big outstanding issues settled between the ANC and the NP.  It's not a contest, the ANC will get its way. Thank heavens the vast bulk of the Bill of Rights is already concluded.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Smuts says she is angry that the Nats &quot;dropped&quot; her &quot;from one moment to the other&quot; on the limitations clause. The limitations clause is a burning point of principle, not only to Smuts and the DP, but also to NGOs and a posse of Johannesburg lawyers, who have been watching the process anxiously from a distance, either from the public gallery or through the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the ANC, and now the NP, want a limitation clause which permits government to limit rights when it is considered &quot;justifiable&quot; and &quot;reasonable&quot;, the DP and NGOs such as the Human Rights Committee want the limitation to be stricter --- to prove limitation as &quot;neccessary&quot;. This test would make it more difficult for the government to invade the rights of citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Susie Cowen of the Human Rights Committee said in response to signs that &quot; the necessity test&quot; was to be left out of the clause: &quot;It's hard to understand why government should be permitted to limit rights unnecessarily.  A weak limitation clause undermines the essence of the rights themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Smuts maintains that the NP bent to the ANC, saying that the moment NP negotiators had wavered on the limitations clause in multi- party meetings this week, the ANC had suggested a bilateral which had excluded the DP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She had believed that concerted DP and NP action could have &quot;saved the limitations clause&quot;. It was within our grasp,&quot; she said. &quot;The root to the dilution of the Bill of Rights, this current formulation gives the nod to the courts that they can relax the limitation on invasion of rights by the government.&quot; Smuts moved an amendment on Wednesday which had no success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The DP is similarly disappointed that the NP has not fought the ANC more strongly on the property clause, which Hofmeyr says is nearing a conclusion with which the ANC could live. This is despite last-minute representations by the business community to have it changed. Smuts indicated that the DP and the business community were frightened that the imperative to land reform in that clause would override the guarantees of property, when tested in court.  The ANC through Hofmeyr maintains the DP is reneging on an agreement struck by technical advisers at the Arniston conference. The DP insists this agreement was never sanctioned by politicians, and that it formally reserved its position at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Says Angela Andrews of the Legal Resources Centre: &quot;NGOs are still considering whether the current formulation effectively downgrades the right from its status as a fundamental right so that it possibly falls foul of the constitutional principles. If this is the case, it still can be challenged in the constitutional court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What is frightening, at this stage, is that many of the NGO commentators and academics that sit on the sidelines of the human rights debate openly confess that they do not know what opinions motivate certain decisions by political parties in their choice of crucial formulations. There is a growing despair at what are seen to be trade-offs on issues of principle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The content of human rights must be determined on their own merits rather than as the results of political trade-offs,&quot; said Cowen. &quot;Political agreements can be easily destabilised by current pressures and that does not lead to a durable constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, while NGOs are at this stage being sidelined by grootpolitiek, Cosatu is playing a pivotal role in the determination of the labour relations clause. Neil Coleman said that Cosatu had met the NP twice over the week to discuss the lock-out clause on which it was not prepared to move. He said that Cosatu's national executive would meet on Friday to discuss the Constitution as a whole, deciding either to sanction it or protest against it through national mass action. The NP has already agreed to concede the closed shop agreement to the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Meyer said this week that Cosatu had not threatened him with national mass action if it did not give up on the lock-out clause, Coleman said that the &quot;NP must be aware of what an emotive issue the lock-out clause is among workers, of which there are many in the Western Cape. The National Party must be aware of the implications of seeming to support employers against workers in the run-up to the local government elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Pressure-cooker politicking to resolve final constitutional disputes by Friday's deadline has forced the African National Congress and the National Party into a series of exclusive bilaterals which promise to deliver package deals and compromises on key stand-offs between the two parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By midnight Wednesday, NP secretary general Roelf Meyer was able to list 14 outstanding disputes to be cracked within the next 24 hours. Of these, the most dear to the NP's heart are the educational clause in the Bill of Rights, language rights, cultural councils, the structure of the executive and the role of minority parties in government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NP insiders believe Meyer as chief negotiator is prepared to trade off other disputes for the sake of getting what he wants on these.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The package approach --- where trade-offs come in a package cemented by the Nats and the ANC and cannot be unraveled by subsequent opposition from less powerful quarters --- characterised the last days of the interim Constitution negotiations at Kempton Park in November 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the last instance, just hours before deadline, the ANC and the Nats, through Cyril Ramaphosa (now Constitutional Assembly chairman) and Meyer, produced a six-pack of agreements that essentially could not be touched by other parties because meddling would have meant risking losing consensus on the Constitution altogether. At the time, disgruntlement about the six-pack was qualified by recognition that agreement was essential to pull the country through multi- party talks and on to the scheduled April elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because of numerical strength of parties in the Constitutional Assembly, the ANC needs the support of the NP to pass the final Constitution by a two-thirds majority. With that support, the ANC does not have to worry about getting the smaller parties on board, although it has repeatedly said that it wants as &quot;inclusive&quot; an agreement on the Constitution as is possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Critics speculated the NP could use the ANC's dependence on the NP's supporting vote as an important lever, to win concessions from the ANC.  However, Nat insiders indicate the top team of negotiators does not believe it is possible to take a &quot;do or die&quot; stance, and threatening to cut support for the ANC for the sake of principle is not an option good either for the Nats or for the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meyer said midweek that &quot;reaching consensus&quot; was the NP's &quot;chief motivating force&quot;. Meyer also appears sensitive to the fact that a deadlock between the ANC and the NP could lead to either a referendum or an election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Moosa and Meyer appear confident the essentials will fall into place, there is a fear within the NP that the Freedom Front will steal an Afrikaner victory from under its nose. Both the NP and the FF want mechanisms to protect the Afrikaner language and culture from the cultural rough and tumble of the new South Africa, and both wish to claim having won those mechanisms as victories in the run- up to the local government election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the Nats have placed their ambitions in the context of protection for all cultures, the Freedom Front has doggedly stuck to its guns on white Afrikanerdom, and has made this its bottom line, neglecting or ignoring other aspects of constitutional debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The FF's negotiator Corne Mulder said midweek the skeleton of an agreement with the ANC has been worked out, although he could not describe the package until the deal had been clinched. It includes cultural protection on education, partly through cultural councils and partly through inserting a number of extra clauses in the Bill of Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mulder did not think it would be difficult to introduce new formulations into the Bill of Rights at this stage. The deal would also make provision for the establishment of a mechanism or instrument, such as the Volkstaat Councils, to continue to pursue the volkstaat dream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All these deals will be discussed openly in the Constitutional Assembly next week, when draft legislation will be on the table and political parties will be able to move formal amendments to alter agreements. This means that behind-the-scenes negotiations on key issues can continue, but because a firm draft is on the table, it will be more difficult for political parties to change position on essential issues and save face for their electorate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Pretoria Attorney General Jan D'Oliveira, whose office this week wound up its marathon prosecution of Eugene de Kock, plans to charge more security force members in high-profile &quot;political&quot; murder trials over the next &quot;month or two&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These prosecutions may pre-empt applications by perpetrators of apartheid crimes to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission --- and may, in at least one instance, help appease a victim who has been vocal in his opposition to the commission.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It appears likely that D'Oliveira's office, which was instructed to investigate and prosecute &quot;third force&quot; crimes in early 1994, will bring the alleged killers of Pretoria anti-apartheid doctor Fabian Ribeiro and his wife Florence to justice soon. Their son, Chris Ribeiro, is one of a number of victims who have mounted a Constitutional Court challenge against the truth commission's right to dispense amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But well-placed sources indicated this week that D'Oliveira was still in no position to dispense justice in what he called his &quot;first real third force trial&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> D'Oliveira told Parliament's Justice Portfolio Committee last September that he could not prosecute in the case due to a lack of staff. The sources said the staffing problems remained in spite of D'Oliveira's appeal at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The charges, which may implicate at least two former police generals, are understood to revolve around the alleged supply of large amounts of weaponry to the Inkatha Freedom Party by security force elements in the run-up to the 1994 general elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prosecution against perpetrators of &quot;political&quot; crimes can be interrupted when application for amnesty is made to the truth commission, but the decision rests with the attorney general and the trial judge. Even when charges have not been formally laid, there is no automatic recourse to the commission where charges have already been investigated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Recently divorced President Nelson Mandela is not in the market for a first (or should it be third?) lady. He can cope perfectly well on his own, say his staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But bachelor presidents are the exception rather than the rule, with most heads of state relying on their wives to lend a helping hand, particularly at ceremonial occassions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela does require an escort occasionally, especially during state visits to South Africa and his visits abroad. Three women fill that role: his two daughters with Winnie, Zenani and Zinzi and his grandaughter Rochelle Mtirara. While Mtirara is not a blood relative, she is the grandaughter of King Sabata Dalindyebo and regarded as Mandela's relative by custom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conspicuously absent from his choices is his daughter from his first marriage, Dr Maki Mandela, University of Witwatersrand affirmative action officer. Relations between Mandela and Maki have been strained since 1994 when she publicly called on people not to vote for the ANC and declared her support for the Democratic Party. She did not respond to requests for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The choice of which of the three escorts the president uses depends a lot on their own schedules. Zinzi and Zenani have families of their own and are not always available,&quot; said Mandela's spokesman Parks Mankahlana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zenani accompanied Mandela on his official visit to New Zealand last year. He has not yet informed his staff who will join him on his visit to England and France in July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mankahlana said Mandela did not believe South Africa needed an official first lady and could cope on his own with state visits to South Africa. On his state visits abroad, however, he required someone to accompany his host's wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The last two South African heads of state were far more concerned with protocol arrangements than Mandela, and he had dispensed with many of their traditions since assuming office, Mankahlana said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Elize Botha was better known for her sunny smile and garish dresses, Marieke de Klerk played a more active role in supporting her husband. De Klerk was not shy of political involvement either, heading up the National Party's women's organisation and standing in for her husband at party gatherings during the 1994 election campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's chief of state visits Kingsley Makhubela said he believed the position of first lady was a waste of taxpayers' money. &quot;Unlike the United States which has an office of the first lady and tasks laid down by law, South Africa has no such arrangement,&quot; said Makhubela. &quot;Hilary Clinton is so politically involved that Clinton once quipped 'you voted for one, but got two instead'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said first ladies were not elected officials, and that fact could cause problems if they involved themselves in the running of the country. &quot;So it is better that we do not follow the example of the United States, it is a waste of taxpayers' money to establish an official position of first lady.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The name of Karl Andrew Webber does not feature large in the story of South Africa's liberation struggle. But as he sat there, clutching at the stump of his missing arm in the light filtering through stained-glass windows, there was a sense that he had carved out a small place for himself in South Africa's history books.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The huge burgundy curtains on the stage in East London's city hall provided a fitting backdrop for the 17 truth commissioners when they set about uncovering the horrors of the apartheid era on Monday. From the moment Archbishop Desmond Tutu clambered up onto the stage to light a &quot;candle of remembrance&quot; the proceedings smacked more of theatrical performance than judicial inquiry.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the theatrical tradition there was even a publicity poster, a huge banner strung across the stage announcing the production: &quot;Truth &amp; Reconciliation Commission --- Healing our Past.&quot; They even stalled to make sure the audience was in place; &quot;Arch&quot; --- as the Anglican primate likes to be known --- announcing a few minutes' delay to give SATV time to cross to East London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then, being more of an archbishop than a theatrical producer, or chairman of commissions, he led his congregation in a Xhosa hymn before delivering a short homily. &quot;We are charged to unearth the truth about our dark past; to lay the ghosts of that past so that they may not return to haunt us. That it may thereby contribute to the healing of a traumatised and wounded nation; for all of us in South Africa are wounded people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They were familiar ghosts which were paraded across the stage. The first was one of the best-known of South Africa's litany of deaths in detention --- that of Mapetla Mohapi, a close friend and colleague of Steve Biko. His widow, Nohle Mohapi, recounted the story with the familiarity of a tale often told since that night in 1976 when a police officer, &quot;Fouche&quot;, knocked at her door and announced: &quot;I am here to tell you that Mapetla hanged himself with a pair of jeans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, for all the familiarity, there was the recollection of passionate certainty in her voice as she recounted how she remonstrated with Fouche: &quot;He was a person with a vision for the future. He had plans for his life, for his family and his country as a whole. I said: No, not Mapetla!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taken to the mortuary to identify his body she was confronted by a black policeman who laughed. &quot;They call themselves leaders and they kill themselves!&quot; he taunted her. One does not make jokes about death, Mrs Mohapi reminded the commissioners, adding with the weary remembrance of long time past: &quot;I really realised then that it was a long journey that we were going to make.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And so the performance rolled on. Or was it performance? At times it seemed more a group therapy session. The lawyers leading the evidence had been instructed by the commission to let the witnesses talk, in the hope it would bring them a personal catharsis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the catharsis was there, as the women let loose their pain with accounts of the years of struggle raising children without fathers, suffering detention and beatings themselves and endlessly searching for the truth of what had happened to their loved ones and a chance to bury them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The widows of the &quot;Pepco 3&quot; took the stand to tell of the mysterious phone call that summoned their husbands to the airport to meet a non-existent British consular official, never to be seen again. Robert Kohl, his wife Cecelia at his side, described how police opened fire on a funeral procession, killing their eldest son, Bully. At the mortuary &quot;I could feel the cold had already crept into his body and I had to leave to be alone and think about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I wish the commission could give me a tombstone for Siphiwe,&quot; Toni Lillian Mazwai said of her son, killed in a shootout with police in the Transkei. Nombwyselo Mhlawuli just wanted a chance to bury her husband's hand which was chopped off when he was killed. She had heard it was being kept somewhere in Port Elizabeth, in a bottle. Nomonde Calata had been told that her husband's body was found with his hair pulled out, his fingers amputated and his tongue &quot;was very long&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nomonde's tears forced an adjournment and when the commission re-assembled &quot;Arch&quot; led them in the funeral lament, Senzeni Na ? ---&quot;What have we done?&quot; intoned the interpreter over the translator's earphones worn by the press. &quot;What have we done? Our sin is kindness ...&quot; And soon there were more tears, &quot;Arch&quot; breaking down and weeping as Singqokwana Malgas told of the police torture that had put him in his wheel chair, of the acid that had killed his son ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judicial commission? Church service? Theatre? Group therapy? Funeral? In the end, as in the beginning, it was none of those things. Because somehow it was all defined on the first day by that quiet little man, Karl Andrew Webber. Burly with closely-cropped hair and sporting a shabby track-suit top, he was the picture of that stereotype which is the white South African; a rugby player perhaps - -- a hooker, surely?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact he was an animal-welfare inspector who had made the mistake of going to a local bar for a drink on May Day in 1993 with a friend who had just flown in from Cape Town. The friend died with five others when the masked gunman walked into the bar and opened fire with an assault rifle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My life changed overnight,&quot; Webber said, describing his battle with his surviving, mutilated arm to dress, feed, bath and shave himself and to survive on state aid of R410 a month. &quot;I've accepted it and I have to carry on with the daily routine of my life,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An official from the commission --- a black, middle-aged woman --- sat next to Webber as he spoke, a comforting arm around his shoulder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What was his attitude towards the truth inquiry, asked a commissioner?  &quot;Hopefully it is the start of a new beginning,&quot; he replied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - When former Military Intelligence Sergeant Andre Cloete shifted from his rigid attention- like stand in the witness box on Tuesday morning, lifting his right arm to his face, it seemed as if he might offer an apologetic salute to the generals in the dock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The salute never materialised, but the impression of the obedient soldier intensified through the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Testifying in the mass murder trial of former defence minister Magnus Malan and 19 others, which resumed on Monday in the Durban Supreme Court after a two-week recess, Cloete --- the Caprivi instructor of 40 offensive unit members trained by Operation Marion --- appeared uncomfortable with his own betrayal of the accused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He looked less tense about his role in the death of 13 innocent women and children in the January 1987 KwaMakhutha massacre.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While he had thought &quot;long and hard&quot; about his decision to become the state's second star witness in the case against his former superiors, Cloete had dutifully obeyed &quot;orders&quot; from his superior --- state witness and former South African Defence Force Major &quot;JP&quot; Opperman --- to &quot;wipe out&quot; United Democratic Front activist Victor Ntuli's entire family, and had trained his men to kill &quot;everybody in the house&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The soldier whose standard nine education took him into &quot;dangerous operations&quot; in Angola, Zambia, former Rhodesia and Mozambique in defence of apartheid before his recruitment into Operation Marion became putty in the hands of the defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Testifying --- mostly in the short answers expected of military juniors --- under cross- examination by defence advocate Mike Maritz that he had been &quot;pressured&quot; by investigators to make his statement resemble Opperman's, Cloete said he felt he would be arrested if he did not agree to testify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Initially speaking as if the death of &quot;everyone&quot; at a target was a standard operating procedure which would be applied regardless of &quot;whether his target was a hospital, an old-age home or a 'terrorist' cell&quot;, Cloete later declared that the order to &quot;wipe out&quot; Ntuli's family had been &quot;the most outrageous&quot; he had ever received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier Cloete testified that the only reason the KwaMakhutha operation was not a success was that &quot;the target was not eliminated&quot;. Unlike Opperman --- who testified that the attack had gone &quot;horribly wrong&quot; when women and children were killed --- Cloete exhibited no physical body language to indicate signs of a conscience in torment: he had only followed orders, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those orders, Cloete testified, had come from Opperman. Told by Maritz that Opperman had blamed him for what he called the &quot;fiasco&quot; the attack became, Cloete said: &quot;That is not correct&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Cloete stopped himself from calling Opperman a liar on Tuesday, his inhibitions had vanished by Wednesday when he declared that his former superior was a &quot;madman&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seizing on the apparent animosity between Cloete and Opperman --- whose decision to turn state's evidence had led the Investigation Task Unit to Cloete --- Maritz wooed Cloete: &quot;Being an experienced soldier like yourself, you would want to do a target evaluation to determine when to attack. You don't just storm into a place. You're highly trained?&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cloete agreed, obviously proud of his military career which stretched over more than 14 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Probing Cloete on why he --- a Special Forces &quot;attack specialist&quot; --- had not then been in charge of planning the attack, instead of the relatively &quot;inexperienced&quot; Opperman, Maritz said: &quot;So it seems Opperman was moving in your field of operation?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Yes ... Yes, Opperman did have no experience and he was into an area he knew nothing about,&quot; declared Cloete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both Opperman and Cloete were recruited by Colonel Hennie Blauw, but two men recruited by the same man for the same purpose could not be more different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opperman, cool and sophisticated despite having only one more year of education than Cloete, described his participation in Operation Marion and the KwaMakhutha massacre in colourful detail. Defence lawyers were reduced to intimidatory tactics over his decision to testify in English, and innuendos about his decision to seek witness protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cloete, on the other hand, having rejected witness protection and clinging to his mother tongue --- even complaining that his original statement had been translated into English because the investigators did not speak Afrikaans --- answered only what he was asked. The image of the loyal soldier endures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nevertheless, Cloete's testimony implicated 10 of the accused --- including five Caprivi trainees as well Inkatha Freedom Party deputy secretary general &quot;MZ&quot; Khumalo, former Military Intelligence Major John More, Ferntree base commander Dan Griesel, former senior Natal Command intelligence officer Jacobus Victor, and former Camp Hippo Commander Gerhardus Jacobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trial continues.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Cyril Rampahosa did not jump, he was pushed. His decision to opt for a corporate position was not his first choice: he would rather have been finance minister. But he found his political options closed off as deputy president Thabo Mbeki moved to consolidate his power, and this amounted to a shove.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His decision to leave politics has fuelled concerns within the African National Congress and its alliance partners that were set off by the dismissal of former posts, telecommunications and broadcasting minister Pallo Jordan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Founded in an increasingly unhappy relationship between the ANC as a party and the ANC in government, the concerns centre on a felt lack of consultation and debate within the movement and a watering-down of the glue that held the party together during its years in exile --- the pluralism that allowed for a &quot;broad church&quot; that could accommodate diverse political views and talents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A key question being asked this week was why moves to ease Ramaphosa out went ahead when an (admittedly informal) consensus --- which included Ramaphosa --- had already been reached that Mbeki would succeed President Nelson Mandela and that there would be no bloody leadership contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The resultant shift in power in government has fed concerns about a new culture and style of politics emerging. Cabal is not the word being used, but there is talk about the ascendancy of groups taking decisions outside ANC constitutional structures. While their right to meet is not disputed, concern is mounting over the possibility of such meetings being used to shunt capable people, such as Jordan and Ramaphosa, from the political frontline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These anxieties are feeding into a wider concern: that ANC and alliance structures have been marginalised in terms of determining policy and strategy, particularly on the economic front, and that this is feeding suspicions of elites --- business and political --- pacting at various levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbeki is now in a strong position to determine the country's economic trajectory. He is in charge of transformation. But when he announced the government's plans to privatise state assets, labour saw this as him aligning himself with old economic establishment agendas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decision to close the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) office, without any simultaneous articulation of a clear policy to take reconstruction and development forward, also sparked concerns about a lack of both consultation and forward-thinking on a cornerstone policy of the ANC --- although the decision itself was felt to be correct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Concerns emanated not only from within the ANC and the alliance, but also from foreign governments which frame their aid agreements around the RDP and were perplexed by the sudden closure of the office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Labour's head-on response to the South Africa Foundation's Growth for All strategy is evidence of attempts by the democratic movement to get its act together and regain lost ground. Discussions are under way within the alliance to develop a more coherent approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ramaphosa has said he is being &quot;deployed&quot; in his new job as executive deputy chairman of New Africa Investments Limited (Nail) to spearhead black economic empowerment. He will be part of a joint bid by Nail and the National Empowerment Consortium (NEC) to buy Anglo-American's 48% share of industrial group Johnnic, of which the newspaper group Times Media Limited is the major interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But news of his decision --- leaked soon after he began a round of consultations with senior ANC members and organised labour --- came as a surprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some believe Ramaphosa is acting out of pique. While this element cannot be discounted, it is not the driving force behind his decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That his move was not discussed within the ANC leadership or structures has raised questions --- such as who deployed him, with what mandate, and underpinned by what strategy? Parallels were being drawn this week with a similar unbundling that took place after the Nationalist Party came to power in 1948 when Afrikaners were given a slice of the big business pie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another concern being expressed was the absence of a collective approach by the ANC leadership in planning career paths for senior --- and valued --- members. The view is that deploying people in business may be the right move, but that it should be decided collectively, rather than being a case of &quot;bump and push&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is known that Nail has carried out a long flirtation with Ramaphosa: when he indicated an interest in going into business ahead of ANC leadership elections in 1994, it was in response to an early overture from Nail's chairman Dr Nthato Motlana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mail &amp; Guardian has it on good authority that Ramaphosa had his eye on becoming finance minister once he discharged his duty of steering through the new constitution, and that he was given indications this would become a reality. However, these then evaporated --- and the job went to former trade and industry minister Trevor Manuel. Mandela's statement that there would be no further reshuffle is said to have been the last straw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Cosatu responded with a wait-and-see attitude to his decision, Nail's linkage with the NEC --- with its mining, clothing and textile-union interests --- does offer Ramaphosa possibilities to plough virgin territory and develop a broad support base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trade unions want to use their pension funds to generate profits, but members will hold their representatives to their mandates, will want report-backs and will expect spending on social development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there are those who are disappointed Ramaphosa did not opt for focusing on his position as secretary general of the ANC. After his election to the post in 1991 he was plunged into negotiations. On his re-election in 1994 --- after being persuaded to stand by Mandela, who rallied provincial support for him --- he took on the job of co-chairing the Constitutional Assembly, again at Mandela's insistence. He has been able to devote little time to the job, which has been performed mostly by his capable deputy, Cheryl Carolus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ramaphosa said this week the possibility of his staying on until fresh leadership elections at the ANC's national congress in December 1997 was under discussion and that he would abide by any decision of the leadership, indicating that he was keen on keeping his options open.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Banjul - The Gambian National Dance Troujps will be among other African groups to perform at a cultural festival in the United States during the Atlanta Olympic games in July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Beside this rare performance, the troups will also tour and perform in 20 historically black colleges in 20 states in the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The colleges include Wilberforce University, Knoxville College, Kentucky State University, Alabama State Uniersity and Tuskegee University among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This good news was revealed to the Daily Observer by Dr. Manuel H.  Pierson, the president of an American organisation packaging the tour. The organisation, called Fund for African/African-American Cultural and Educational Solidarity, Inc. (Faces), is based in Detroit, Michigan. Dr.  Pierson is currently in the country engaged in various community development projects in the provinces.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According the Dr. Pierson, the tour is &quot;designed to export Gambian and indeed, African culture to the world through the performance at the globally-attended Olympic Gaes Festival. It will also afford African-Americans first hand contact with African culture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is also a fundraising tour. Half of the money realised will go to the Ministry of Culture, the other half shall take care of the troupe's expenses and FACES development projects in The Gambia,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FACES had taken the troupe on a similar tour in the U.S. in October last year. The troupe was accompanied by the then Minister of Culture, Amina Faal-Sonko. It performed at the Jackson Vaughan Centre for Performing Arts, Wayne County Community College in Detroit and many other sites. The performances were well attended by U.S. senators, congressmen, governors and mayors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When contacted by this newspaper for comments, the Artistic Director of the troupe, Tijaan Kamara, said, &quot;If it is possible, it will be a good deal for The Gambia. A performance at such a reputable international jamboree as the Olympic Games shall sell our culture to the world and a lot is possible through that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Kamara described last year's U.S. tour as &quot;excellent and successful.&quot; There were workshops and talks about various aspects of our culture before most performances.<BR> It helped the Americans a great deal in understanding our culture. Our performance really thrilled the Americans, most of whom expressed the desire to visit The Gambia. The reviews we enjoyed in the American press were so great that it won us many fans and increased the commercial value of our troupe.&quot; Mr. Kamara added that &quot;the Troupe's sustenance is hinged on these foreign tours. The little money we make here cannot sustain the Troupe. Most other national troupes spend most time in Europe and America because it brings the needed finance.&quot;<BR> He appealed to all Gambians to support the Troupe as a lot of funding is needed for instruments and instrumentalists. &quot;It is our Troupe and it is for the promotion of our culture,&quot; he said.<BR> The troupe has engaged in regular rehearsals and it will come out with a six-track audio cassette of traditional songs with purely traditional instruments.<BR> An impeccable source at the Minister of Culture disclosed that &quot;the Ministry is pleased with the progress of the Troupe which it looks forward to as capable of bringing greater development for the tourism industry in The Gambia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Banjul - The second edition of the West African Junior Athletics Championship will be held in Banjul from the 25th to the 27th of April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The event will be the biggest international sporting gathering in The Gambia in recent times as 16 African countries are expected to bring at least 30 athletes to this two-day athletics jamboree.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This new regional format of the competition was first introduced at the world athletic championship in Stuttgart, Germany in 1993 when the then Zone 2 and 3 were amalgamated to form the Western Region of the African continent.  Also at that meeting, it was decided to hold the event every two years in order to scout and develop Africa's young athletes especially in the region.  The first edition took place in Benin in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the Gambia Amateur Athletics Association (GAAA), the championship is open to athletes who were born in 1977 and later (19 years and under) and 14events would be competed for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Gambia will field a team to participate in all events. A provisional team has been selected and undergoing vigorous training under the close tutelage of Abdoulie Carr, Patrick Bandele and Bamba Njie. The athletes, who are expected to number about 500, are due here from the 23rd of April onward.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) has helped member countries of the region establish trade between them amounting to more than US$1.6 billion and which is still growing at annual rate of 10.1 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> COMESA Secretary-General, Dr Bingu Mutharika, says in 1982 intra-COMESA trade was at only US$500 and he is now hopeful that the organisation will yield even further fruits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was speaking at the official opening of second meeting of the inter-governmental committee at Mulungushi International Conference Centre in Lusaka.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Much of this trade has been encouraged by reduced customs tariffs on imports from member countries which in some cases have gone down by as much as 70 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a way of eliminating non-tarrif barriers members countries have reduced restrictions on import and export licencing, foreign exchange allocations, exchange controls, quotas, taxes and other transanctions restrictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the transport and communications sector member countries have also focused on mobilisation of funding for intra-strcture linkages and the harmonisation of transport and communications policies with particular emphasis being laid on the rehabilitation and upgrading of sub-standard segments of the roads and railways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Mutharika, however, noted with concern that the industrial sector has been adversely affected by the Structural Adjustment Programme being implemented in most member states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''We have been forced to liberalise and open our markets to global trade without protecting our own industries and in real terms there has been a degree of de-industrialisation though with variations from country to country,'' Dr Mutharika said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The results of this are clearly visible in terms of job losses, ounting unemployment, plant closures and reduction in domestic production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the agricultural sector the COMESA region has experienced erratic rainfall patterns for the past five years and has as a result seen acute food shortages necessitating huge imports which have been a huge drain on scarce foreign currency resources in member countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The study being undertaken by COMESA on irrigation development and management of river and lake basins when completed is expected to make practical and implemntable recommendations aimed at improving the performance of the agricultural sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Mutharika also reminded delegates to honour their pledges saying member states must pay their contributions in full and on time if the organisation is to fully realise its potential.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE National Women's Lobby Group (NWLG) has adopted a Women's Rights Charter to guide all women's Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rights charter was adopted at a three day consultative workshop in Lusaka over the weekend to enable all women speak with one voice in their quest for equal rights and equity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I hope this charter we have adopted today will be presented to all stakeholders in the political circles, to sensitise everyone on women's rights,&quot; NWLG chairperson Gladys Mutukwa said at the close of the workshop in Lusaka on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said the adoption of the charter was decided after noticing contradictions in the interpretations of women's rights by different NGOs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The charter covers extensively on women's rights, and this is the beginning of the struggle for recognition of our rights,&quot; Mutukwa said, adding, &quot;the bulk of the struggle is yet to come.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The charter will be translated in all the major local languages to enable all women have access to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Friedrich Ebert Stiftung country representative Gerd Lieser called on government to enact laws which will protect women from discrimination and recognise their human rights per- se'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is need to empower women through the law, that is, using the law to strengthen the social, political and economic means of women,&quot; Lieser said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said equality is a cornerstone of every democratic society which aspires to social justice and human rights, and it is a duty of every state to promote and protect.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Yusuf Seedat, handler of Zambia's lightweight champion would do well to look to South Africa for a number of warm-up fights for his boxer as part of the preparations for a go at the Commonwealth lightweight title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the hot fighters who could give Bwalya good preparations are Commonwealth lightweight contender Jan Bergmani, Dingaan Thobela (a former WBC and WBO title holder) who has now re-gained his old form, Aaron Kabi a highly-rated boxer, Brain Mitchell, the undefeated but retired World Boxing Council lightweight champion, who is also on a come-back bid.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is also Naas Scheepers, Justice Mthembo, Ashley Whiteboy and Victor Magwaza, but all very capable of giving Felix &quot;The Hammer&quot; Bwalya, the type of opposition to get out of Zambia and do wonders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paul &quot;Iron&quot; Ryan, the Commonwealth lightweight title holder is not a world beater as such but he is aggressive, tough and fit and, unless another debacle like the Nigel Benn first round of knockout of Mike Chilambe some six years is to take place, the talented Bwalya must have at least three warm-up fights with experienced and reputable fighters to check if he has the stamina to stand up in the real boxing world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But before thinking of arranging such warm-ups, Seedat must be aware that apart from his boxer, there is Jan Bergman (South Africa), Michael Galarneau (Canada), David Kamau (Kenya), Malcolm Meluim (UK), and Australian, Shannon Tayor, all on the waiting list to grab the Commonwealth lightweight title from Ryan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - There was an unexplained shortage of sugar in Lusaka yesterday resulting in long queues at the city's major super markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Kamwala, James Simbeye, proprietor of Simbeye Enterprises had a tough time controlling customers at his shop who were struggling to buy sugar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These people have been waiting here from around 09:00 hours after I assured them I will have sugar during the day, and I thought they would give up, but they persevered until at about 12:30 hours when I received the commodity,&quot; Simbeye revealed in an interview yesterday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But some customers out side the shop said they had been there since 8:00 hours. &quot;Some of us have been here from the time the shop opened in the morning, and we kept on checking on it, but when I noticed people were gathering, I also started waiting,&quot; said one Lilanda resident Monica Hamoonga. &quot;Had you come in the morning, you should have seen the number of people who were here, I think it's the only shop with sugar today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Zambia Sugar Company managing director, David Covell, denied the shortage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't think there is any shortage, it's only that these people like buying in bulk for resale at higher prices and that may cause a speculation of shortage,&quot; Covell explained in an interview yesterday. &quot;Otherwise, there is plenty of sugar in stock.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Covell advised consumers not to panick, and start hoarding the commodity as it may lead to a price increase. He also advised customers to avoid black market prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The 10 kilogramme pocket is K8,000 and the 2 kilogramme is K1,250, these are the recommended retail prices, do not buy at more than that,&quot; Covell advised .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But at Simbeye's shop, there was only 10 kilogramme pockets and were selling at K8,500.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The growing threat to the stability of Zambia may have formed the core of talks between America's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and President Chiluba's government last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia, recently listed among countries most vulnerable to a breakdown of government by the CIA, played host to its director John Deutch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deutch was in the country meeting President Chiluba and other senior government officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the trip is said to have been at the invitation of the Zambian government there are indications it may have been prompted by worrying revelations made by the CIA early this year that governance may collapse in Zambia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There has been no official government position on why it 'invited' the CIA director and all key spokesmen remained mute over the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A senior Zambia Intelligence Security Service (ZISS) official said Deutch's visit was especially for meetings with President Chiluba and not his organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief government spokesman Amusaa Mwanamwambwa excused himself and referred the matter to the US ambassador saying &quot;only America is competent to discuss this,&quot; while President Chiluba's spokesman Richard Sakala advised The Post to go by a Zambia Daily Mail (Saturday) report which merely announced the presence of Deutch in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But some opposition leaders feel government should take the CIA advice seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The whole world is concerned about the stability of this country. It is good that all those who are concerned should prevail over President Chiluba since all the local efforts have failed,&quot; said Zambia Democratic Congress General Secretary Derrick Chitala</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIP president Kenneth Kaunda also said events in the country and the conduct of government justify the CIA concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deutch, who is also a member of the US cabinet, landed in the country last Wednesday for talks with government but according to a statement from the American embassy there is a possibility the CIA chief was alerting government on some of the issues in the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The director is meeting with President Chiluba and senior government officials to exchange views on a range of important global trends and concerns, to discuss transnational threats to the security of all nations,&quot; said a statement, Friday, from US information director Steadman Howard who added that the CIA chief was also &quot;encouraging Zambia's continued support for the international community's efforts to combat these challenges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia was listed vulnerable together with several other third world countries, in a detailed analytical report conducted by the CIA into reasons why countries in the world fall apart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report which was made at the request of the US vice president Al Gore last year, is intended to forewarn policy makers in concerned countries ahead of any such crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the report also quoted in America's US World Report the CIA can now alert governments of the possibility of a breakdown at least two years before it occurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CIA probe team dubbed &quot;State Failure Task Force&quot; used 'sophisticated techniques to identify key factors' that can read the direction of a particular country and predict with close to 100% accuracy, its status within the next few years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report which was by January in full draft form and leaked to the American press analysed 113 cases of state failure which gave the CIA 600 possible contributing factors. The period used to analyse and predict the future is between 1955 and 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CIA has made firm conclusions that poor democracies such as Zambia &quot;are more unstable than either rich democracies or poor non-democracies&quot; and are more likely to breakdown.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Closed Co-operative Bank has attributed the unfulfilled promise of reopening its doors to business this month to delays by the government in providing the required K3.5 billion to resume operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking in an interview last Friday, Zambia Co-operative Federation managing director, Grieve Sibale, disclosed that the bank was still awaiting for funds from the government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We've had several meetings with the government and up to now no money has been given out which explains why we haven't reopened the bank as yet,&quot; Sibale said, adding:&quot;The reopening of the bank depends on the securing of K3.5 billion to help sustain operations and the government has already shown its commitment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But when contacted to explain delays in loaning funds to the bank, finance minister Ronald Penza said the bank's hopes were a piped dream as no money was available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Just where are we going to get the money to give them,&quot; Penza asked in an interview on Saturday. &quot; There is no money and infact we (government) are not the bank's shareholders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Penza said he expected any other business entity to mobilise its own resources and not to depend on &quot;handouts&quot; from government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sibale, however, disclosed that he expected a run on the bank immediately it reopened but explained that the bank would still fight for the K3.5 billion so that it could still remain afloat even after the expected run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sibale further observed that depositors were slowly losing patience but assured them that more funds were being sought and efforts were being made to raise some funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are also trying to raise some funds from the bank's shareholders but it is expected to be far below the K3.5billion we expect from gover-nment,&quot;Sibale said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to eye-witnesses, the most affected area is Chunga compound which has so far recorded the highest number of cholera patients at the centre.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There were more than 28 people admitted by Sunday while 11 more were taken to the hospital yesterday morning,&quot; a resident, Maphenduka Moyo, of house No 34/07, whose wife is also a victim of the disease, disclosed in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Post team that visited the Railway Clinic yesterday found more victims being brought in by midday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But authorities at the clinic declined to disclose the number of patients admitted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The continued depreciation of the kwacha has adversely affected the operations of many companies, and if the trend is not quickly reversed closures may soon be inevitable for some businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This week, the kwacha opened at K1,270 to the US dollar. The minimum rate for the Kwacha to the British Pound was K1,915 while the rate for the South African Rand was K315. Last Saturday, the Rand had closed at K310 around the bureaux in Lusaka.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government is pointing to low copper sales as the main cause of inflation, but businessmen are calling on the government to change their attitude to donors so that Zambia can receive the rest of this year's donor aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Right now, we are working hard on ZCCM plans so as to make it profitable. Mining and agriculture can be turned into major foreign exchange earners,&quot; said finance minister Ronald Penza in an interview over the weekend, refusing to explain why the exchange rate is continually tumbling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Whatever the government might say, we are not blind. We know that when there is no balance of payments support our currency tumbles because our production base is negligible,&quot; said Vincent Mulenga of Lusaka's Lulu's Enterprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And financial analyst Meebelo Mutukwa also charged that balance of payments support makes up the bulk of the country's income in terms of foreign exchange and that currently, donors are withholding aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There are only three avenues of foreign exchange and those are ZCCM exports, private capital inflows which are miniscule because industries such as tourism are virtually non-existent, and the balance of payments support from donors,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mutukwa explained that with ZCCM operating below capacity, the effect of the Kwacha's continual devaluation is devastating especially on businesses and the consumer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Mutukwa, businesses will be failing to recover costs because of the accelerating inflation while the consumer will be weighted down with higher prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the ruling MMD's financial and economic chairman, Enoch Kavindele, who is usually very forthcoming in explaining the country's economic matters, was unwilling to give his view on the continued depreciation of the kwacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am only the financial chairman for the party. Why don't you ask the Bank of Zambia? They are the people qualified to talk about that,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Bank of Zambia public relations manager, Kabinga Pande, said the exchange rate was responding to market conditions and sais he expected it to improve soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition UNIP finance chairman, Rabson Choongo, appealed to the government to reconsider their hostile attitude to donor countries because the exchange rate needed to be stabilised soon to protect people's living standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This government must tell us what they are thinking of doing to arrest inflation because it has got to a point where it is paralysing the operations of businesses in the country,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zambia Association of Manufacturers chairman, Tony Simmonds, reported that members of his organisation have been severely affected by the current economic climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Without a doubt, we are experiencing difficulties when it comes to exports because by the time the goods are completed, the cost would have tripled and the consumers also get to a point where they cannot spend any more,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, D.C. - On February 1, 1996, the Office of the United States Trade Representative released a Comprehensive Trade and Development Policy for the Countries of Africa, in compliance with a 1994 Congressional mandate.  The Trade Representative's report constitutes a set of policy proposals which are to be reviewed and amended by Congress on an annual basis. Members of Congress have formed a bipartisan Congressional Caucus on Trade and Investment in Africa to undertake such a review. In response to an invitation by the Caucus to submit responses to the report, the Washington Office on Africa, on behalf of 18 organizational signatories, sent the following letter to the Caucus leaders, representatives Philip Crane (R-IL), Benjamin Gilman (R-NY), Jim McDermott (D-WA) and Charles Rangel (D-NY).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> April 11, 1996</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dear Representatives Crane, Gilman, McDermott, and Rangel:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank you for your invitation to respond to the Comprehensive Trade and Development Policy for the Countries of Africa, released by the Office of the United States Trade Representative on February 1, 1996. We applaud the formation of a bipartisan Caucus on Trade and Investment in Africa and appreciate the Caucus efforts to promote a thorough and participatory discussion of these vital issues.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We congratulate the original authors and supporters of the 1994 legislation which gave rise to these policy proposals. We concur in their assessment that a coherent and effective US policy towards Africa must encompass a full range of interlocking issues, including trade, development, and investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We strongly support the continuing efforts of both Congress and the Administration to formulate an integrated US-Africa trade and development policy. Although we have strong reservations about the current document, we believe that it represents a valuable preliminary step toward the realization of that goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In particular, we wish to affirm the document's emphasis on the creation of permanent structures within the Executive branch responsible for coordinating US-Africa trade and development policy and overseeing its implementation. We believe that this will help to raise the visibility of US-Africa relations and encourage a thoughtful and systematic approach to the expansion of US ties with the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We also support the document's attention to facilitating regional coordination in Africa. The proposed provisions relating to the designation of groups of countries for cumulation treatment under the terms of the GSP will create new opportunities for African nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several other strategies mentioned in the document are worthy of further exploration. In particular, we would endorse the development of creative and flexible sources of capital and credit, geared to the needs of small producers, credit unions, and cooperative associations. Similarly, we support proposals designed to increase Africa's access to, familiarity with, and use of electronic networks particularly where these seem likely to create opportunities for grassroots community groups and non-governmental organizations to participate more effectively in defining development agendas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While we see these as positive aspects of an emerging policy, we believe that the current document ignores many aspects of African realities and disregards well-grounded African analyses of key issues. Instead, it adopts a &quot;one-size-fits-all&quot; approach to development, the many flaws of which have been repeatedly identified by critics in Africa and around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If we are serious about formulating a comprehensive US trade and development strategy that is capable of narrowing the economic gulf between (and within) the US and Africa, establishing a foundation for sustainable development, and addressing our mutual needs for security and prosperity then we must radically revise our policy priorities. We therefore propose that this process recognize the following general principles:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Trade programs, debt reduction, aid, and other economic cooperation initiatives should be conditioned on transparent standards applied to recipient governments. But such conditionalities should be developed in open debate, rather than being imposed by donors according to a set of rigid economic prescriptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A strategic approach to African development requires explicit discussion of the combined impact of aid, trade, debt, and different structural adjustment policies. The US can most usefully shape its own policies on these complex and related topics only if it is willing to engage in genuine dialogue on these issues within African and multilateral contexts. This should include not only the clubs of Western donors that coordinate policy towards particular African countries, but also a broad range of scholars and representatives of civil society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The US Trade Representative's policy proposals are premised on the assumption that statist economic regimes are primarily responsible for a failure to deliver sustained increases in prosperity for the peoples of Africa. The policy points with approval to the rapid growth achieved by many Asian economies over the past three decades without acknowledging the central role which the governments of these countries played in orchestrating the development process, protecting growth industries, and ensuring social investment in education and agriculture. At the same time, the document presents an unambiguously favorable depiction of structural adjustment policies, ignoring the very grave objections which have been raised by African analysts and which are receiving increasingly serious consideration within the World Bank. As a result, the policy states flatly, &quot;A successful development strategy must be trade-led and market-oriented.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, the experience of most African countries demonstrates that this rigid formula has been equally unsuccessful in generating &quot;sustained increases in prosperity&quot; for Africa's poorest households. Unregulated markets hold few rewards for those who approach them with little or no economic clout. Nevertheless, the dominant policy-making trend of the past decade has been to demand that more and more economic relationships be governed by the market. This model has obstructed the efforts of African leaders, United Nations agencies, and many non-governmental organizations to identify and to implement programs more consistent with &quot;sustainable development.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ultimately, public sector vs. private sector debates obscure much more important questions: questions about what policy choices are being made, about how the fruits of growth and development are distributed within a society, and about the extent to which policy-makers are accountable to the people whose lives they affect. Similarly, a narrow focus on macroeconomic indicators (such as aggregate economic growth) disguises more localized, but equally important, dynamics (such as the differential impact of development across gender, class, ethnicity, etc.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> US policy should not aim to impose market-oriented solutions on Africa, especially when these involve efforts to constrain, indiscriminately, the role of government. Instead, US trade and development strategies should be components of a broader policy agenda which recognizes a useful and legitimate regulatory role for government, promotes the public accountability of government officials, encourages greater incentive-orientation in all economic relationships, and facilitates the efforts of African public, private, and voluntary sector organizations to identify and implement new economic initiatives suited to local needs and conditions. Access to US development assistance and preferential trade and investment programs should be conditional not merely on the beneficiary's adoption of sound and appropriate economic policies, but also on a demonstrated commitment to sustained social investment, to principles of open and democratic administration, and to the full recognition of basic human rights (including, in particular, the rights of women, youth, landless households, and other historically marginalized groups).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Any comprehensive policy must address Africa's enormous debt burden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The current proposals only mention Africa's debt burden in passing. They include no substantive recommendations for a systematic program of debt reduction. Sub-Saharan Africa's debt grew from $84 billion in 1980 to $223 billion by the end of 1995. Twenty-eight sub-Saharan countries have amassed debts which total more than twice their annual income from the export of goods and services. Partly in the interests of enhancing the ability of these nations to service their onerous debts, G-7 nations and Bretton Woods Institutions have promoted export-led growth. As a result, sub-Saharan economies have made little progress toward self-sufficiency while periodic over-production has weakened commodity prices and diminished the purchasing power of their exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Overwhelming debt service obligations prevent most African countries from embarking on any integrated and effective development plan. US policy must acknowledge this situation and address it through the introduction of systematic measures to reduce Africa's bilateral and multilateral debt.  Africa's bilateral debt to the US is less than 3 percent of its overall debt burden. But the US can and should press for revision of the so-called &quot;Naples Terms&quot; that currently govern bilateral debt restructuring. These terms are inadequate in addressing Africa's enormous bilateral debt, primarily to European governments. For example, Uganda was granted only 2 percent reduction of its $3 billion debt under the Naples terms, despite its strong compliance with economic adjustment programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, the US should vigorously support efforts for a comprehensive approach to Africa's debt to multilateral institutions. Any solution should provide additional funding, rather than divert scarce resources from development aid, and should give priority to countries committed to poverty reduction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. A top priority for US trade policy should be the establishment of fair trading terms. Congress is right to recognize trade's potential as a tool for the promotion of economic growth and development, both in the US and in Africa. In order for it to fulfil that potential, however, US policy must do more than simply expand US exports to Africa. Trade growth will only be sustainable if it is bidirectional and if it meets the needs of both partners. Fair terms of trade are a prerequisite for such durable partnerships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The provisions of the GATT treaty, which govern international trade, generally favor industrialized nations. Most African countries have less capacity to take advantage of the new trade opportunities expected to flow from the Uruguay Round agreements. The US should enter into a regular dialogue with a broad cross-section of Africans in order to define more equitable trade terms and to work for their eventual incorporation into existing agreements. In the interim, the US should endeavor to minimize GATT's negative impact on African trading partners by making full use of provisions designed to assist developing countries (such as the Generalized System of Preferences). It should also increase its technical assistance programs to facilitate regional integration and economic diversification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Development assistance should continue for the foreseeable future.  Carefully targeted development assistance can complement trade and investment growth to accelerate economic transformation. Moreover, the US must share responsibility for Africa s problems. Many of Africa's present problems are directly attributable to the Cold War which made countless African nations battlegrounds for US-Soviet competition and to the continent's long and negative experience of precolonial and colonial engagement by Western powers.  The US should be as active in addressing the consequences of these struggles as it was in perpetuating them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, the US must radically reassess its assistance strategies and priorities. We cannot afford to squander funds in the pursuit of short-term economic objectives, on well- intentioned projects which are peripheral to the needs and interests of their ostensible beneficiaries, or on the cultivation of fragile alliances with governments which do not enjoy the support of their citizens. US assistance must be aid that works. It must advance America's interests in long-term peace and security by promoting sustainable and equitable development. African assistance programs should emphasize investment in both physical infrastructure and in human resources.  Social investment is especially important, not only because it puts people at the center of the development process, but also because it enhances the potential for rapid and equitable economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Focused efforts to prevent humanitarian crises are also priority assistance investments, given their potential to avoid more costly crisis-relief expenditures later. And humanitarian aid needs to be rethought so that it lays the groundwork for long-term development rather than only addressing immediate disasters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In conjunction with the reorientation of its funding priorities and the other initiatives discussed above, the US should renew its commitment both to bilateral aid programs and to multilateral institutions, including UN agencies and the IDA facility of the World Bank. US assistance programs should achieve a rough balance in their support for public, private, and voluntary sector initiatives. US aid could be particularly valuable in encouraging national and regional dialogues on trade and private sector development by engaging a cross section of the society (men and women; rural and urban; employed, self-employed, unemployed, and under-employed; public, private, informal, and voluntary sectors; etc.) in discussions related to these topics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, we recognize that this is an evolving policy which is scheduled to be reviewed annually over the next four years. We welcome the opportunity to be involved in this process on an ongoing basis. We also encourage the Caucus to seek out a variety of African perspectives and advice as frequently as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sincerely,</SPAN></P>
