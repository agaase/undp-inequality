<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Judging by the groundswell of international condemnation of the May 18 coup in Sierra Leone, political analysts in Lagos are of the opinion the coup-makers grossly misread the political climate, not only in their country, but in the subregion and the entire African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the Organization of African Unity, the United Nations and the British Commonwealth to the 16-nation Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) of which Sierra Leone is a member, rejection of the coup appears unanimous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The O.A.U., through its Council of Ministers meeting in Harare, Zimbabwe, denounced the coup by Maj. Johnny Koroma and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The O.A.U. has vowed to make government &quot;impossible&quot; for Koromah and his Armed Forces Revolutionary Council which unseated the elected government of Ahmad Tejan Kabbah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.N. has issued a similar threat while Commonwealth Secretary- General Emeka Anyaoku said he supported military intervention by Ecowas to reverse the coup.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Popular opinion in Nigeria is also for military intervention by Abuja in consultation with the other Ecowas members, should diplomacy fail to bring a solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This appears to be in line with a recent suggestion by the Nigerian leader, Gen. Sani Abacha, that given its success in Liberia, the West African Peace Monitoring Group (Ecomog), should be transformed into a permanent peacekeeping force for the subregion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This will be good for peace in West Africa and the leadership role belongs to Nigeria if it manages to get over its own internal political crisis,&quot; said an African diplomat, who asked not to be named.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An American specialist on Africa, Adonis Hoffman, also said that the Sierra Leonean crisis could help narrow the diplomatic gap between Abuja and Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political relations between Nigeria and the United States have been frosty over U.S. charges of human rights abuses and the lack of democracy in Nigeria. The strain has resulted in Washington's imposition of some sanctions against Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hoffman, speaking in a televised interview from New York, said: &quot;Nigeria is in political transition and has the opportunity to work closely with the U.S. to restore democracy in Sierra Leone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some international relations specialists believe that while the U.S.  and other Western countries are busy evacuating their citizens from troubled Sierra Leone, the task of restoring democracy to that country rests squarely on the Ecowas and by implication, on Abuja. Nigeria is not only the current chairman of the community, it also has the largest contingent in the 11,000-man Ecomog force, which could be rallied to help put off the fire in Sierra Leone, the analysts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After several days of subtle diplomacy, Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi, in the first official statement by Abuja on the coup, said Ecowas was &quot;taking appropriate actions to ensure that quick restoration of peace, stability and legitimate government must take place in Sierra Leone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ikimi said Abacha had been holding consultations with other Ecowas leaders on the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports from Freetown say Ecomog troops have been arriving in the Sierra Leone capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separate contingents of troops from Guinea and Ghana were also reported to have either arrived or were on their way to Freetown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To underscore the concern of Ecowas leaders, Ghana President Jerry Rawlings cancelled his trip to Harare for the O.A.U. summit which began today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proponents of an Ecowas military intervention cite a recent situation in Lesotho, when its neigbours -- South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe -- forced a band of coup makers to surrender power to the government the soldiers had ousted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi's neighbours, have resorted to economic sanctions to exact several concessions from the regime of Maj. Pierre Buyoya, who staged a come-back in a coup against an elected government a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Ecowas succeeds in restoring democracy to Sierra Leone, it would send a strong signal to the armies in other countries in the area and to the restive warlords in Liberia. Ecomog was formed because of the mayhem in Liberia in 1990. Its military control over Liberia has enabled West African leaders to broker a peace plan under which national elections are now fixed for July 19. These will effectively end the seven-year civil war in which at least 150,000 people have died in Africa's first republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts also postulate that the situation in Sierra Leone could be an instructive lesson and a reinforcement of the general feeling of abhorrence for undemocratic government in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, as the fear of possible large scale military intervention by Ecomog mounts in Sierra Leone, observers have counselled extreme caution to avoid endangering the lives of innocent civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Popular feeling is that the military option should be a last resort because Sierra Leoneans and the entire international community stand to benefit from a peaceful resolution of the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts have suggested safe conduct out of Sierra Leone and possible asylum for the coup makers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also say that the lessons of the coup should not be lost on the Sierra Leone leadership, especially Kabbah's embattled government who must now address issues that are likely to fuel discontent in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Sierra Leone's estimated four million people need now is an end to the seven-year civil war in which at least 10,000 people have died.  The war, a spill-over from Liberia's own, has turned this mineral-rich country into a nation of poverty.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he was the only candidate after Amara Essy, the foreign minister of Cote d'Ivoire withdrew from the race, the leaders decided to vote instead of adopting the procedure in the 1993 summit in Cairo, when Salim was unanimously re-elected.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was first elected to the post in 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim received 37 votes in his favour and six against. There were two abstentions and two spoiled ballots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six other countries did not vote because they are under sanctions for failure to pay their assessed contributions to the regular budget of the OAU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OAU staff here received the news of the re-election with joy and pledged to continue working with him into the next millennium.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria's first lady, Mariam Abacha, said the spouses of African leaders had been watching in horror the plight of refugees and displaced persons.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Set aside small percentages of your national budgets for the first ladies programme for peace,&quot; she told the OAU summit which opened in Harare on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to standby you in your efforts to end conflicts&quot; she said at Monday's opening of the summit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit opened in the absence of the out-going OAU chairman President Paul Biya of Cameroon due to what was described as the &quot;ongoing legislative elections&quot; in his country. Mariam Abacha became the first lady to address the assembly of heads of state since the inception of the OAU in 1963.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first ladies held their first meeting in Abuja, Nigeria, in May, at the end of which they pledged to complement the efforts of the african leaders in the search for peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Abacha said as mothers, they have been perturbed by the sufferings of the victims of wars. &quot;How long&quot;, she asked, &quot;can we watch helplessly the wondering of refugees. We want to play our quota in ending conflicts&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She called for the establishment of an African eminent persons committee, to include first ladies, to assist in he management of crises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She later presented a copy of the Abuja communique of the of the first ladies meeting to president Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, the current chairman of the OAU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe assured the first ladies that their concern for the resolution of conflicts will not be ignored.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe implored African countries on Monday to strive for economic emancipation now that the continent has largely achieved political independence. ' Addressing the opening session of the 33rd Summit of the Organisation of African Unity in Harare, Mugabe noted the continental body's founding fathers had proclaimed 34 years ago that Africa should first seek the political &quot;kingdom&quot; and all else would follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the achievement of freedom here in Southern Africa, we have fulfilled the political objective although our economic emancipation is yet to follow,&quot; said Mugabe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current summit is the second to be held in Southern Africa following the 1972 meeting held in the Zambian capital, Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For many years our organisation could not hold meetings in Southern Africa by virtue of foreign occupation,&quot; said Mugabe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, however, you come as victorious brothers and sisters, triumphantly marching through the region which has become part of the organisation, now helping to define and pursue a new agenda for the common good of our continent and its peoples.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's political victories, he said, had shown the need for OAU member countries to harness their energies to achieve success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Economic questions have now clearly come to the fore. To solve them, however, we need a correct political environment on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Perhaps the most urgent issue facing Africa today is the vital question of peace in a number of our countries. Peace is a fundamental pre-condition of all other rights by our citizens,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was, therefore, imperative that both the OAU and individual countries give priority to the maintenance of peace through the organisation's mechanism for the resolutions of conflicts, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe noted, however, that although some of the African countries and regions still needed internal peace, some progress had been made since the last OAU summit in Yaounde, Cameroon, last June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Angola, for instance, the establishment of the government of national unity and reconciliation on April 11 this year, marked an important step towards genuine peace in that country,&quot; said Mugabe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are also hopeful that the Angolan government is proceeding to re- establish its sovereignty over its entire territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Liberia, there is also hope that peace will be heralded by the revised Abuja agreement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also condemned the recent coup in Sierra Leone, saying: &quot;democracy must be restored in that country as a matter of urgency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation in the former Zaire had dramatically changed through the victory of the forces of the Democratic Alliance for the Liberation of Congo, followed by the setting up of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, headed by President Laurent Kabila, which most countries now recognized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The country, however, still faces many challenges which merit our attention and that of the international community in the form of assistance of all kinds,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to the United Nations Security Council, Mugabe said there should be no question of first and second class permanent members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The OAU position must be maintained that Africa is entitled to two seats with equal status in the UN Security Council,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions said Monday it fully supported the call for the restoration of democracy in Sierra Leone, where West African troops are currently trying to dislodge the rebellious soldiers and restore normalcy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The confederation's Africa regional general-secretary, Andrew Kailemebo, said in Harare that political changes on the continent should take place through due electoral processes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We, therefore, appeal to all workers, the wider civil society and democratic governments throughout the continent to give maximum support to the efforts of the people of Sierra Leone to rid themselves of the military junta,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African leaders attending the 33rd Organization of African Unity summit in Harare, he said, should denounce the junta and find measures to help restore democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Junior members of the army led by Maj. Johnny Koromah ousted the elected government of Ahmad Tejan Kabbah May 18. The coup makers said they wanted to end the seven-year civil war in Sierra Leone and have invited the rebel Revolutionary United Front, formerly at war with successive governments in Freetown, to join the new administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News reports on Monday say that Guinean, Ghanaian and Nigerian troops from West Africa's Ecomog troops in Liberia have entered in Freetown in support of the ousted government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington, DC - In its budget proposal for Fiscal Year (FY) 1998 (which begins on 1 October 1997), the Clinton Administration requested $13.324 billion for foreign operations programs, an 8.8 percent increase over the FY 1997 appropriated level of $12.25 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration's proposed budget includes $700 million for the Development Fund for Africa and $14 million to fund the African Development Foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The request for the Economic Support Fund (ESF) allocates $10 million to support democratic institution-building and election preparation in Angola and $15 million to support elections, respect for the rule of law, and enhanced government accountability in sub-Saharan Africa. The ESF request also allocates $10 million to fund U.S. Department of Justice programs to enhance the administration of justice and to provide police training throughout the world, including programs in African countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration's request for the U.S. State Department Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs contains $2 million for regional programs in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. In Africa, the program would focus on Nigeria and South Africa, and would be used to provide customs training, enforcement and management training for counternarcotics units, technical training, and funding for demand reduction programs and public education campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In FY 1998, the administration proposes to provide $9.434 million for Migration and Refugee Assistance programs in Africa.  This money would be used to fund programs administered by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the World Food Program, and other governmental and non- governmental organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration plans to make significant increases in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) programs for Africa in FY 1998.  These include $5 million to fund its proposal to create an African Crisis Response Force (ACRF) by improving and expanding the capabilities of African military forces to conduct peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance operations. Another $5 million in FMF funding would go to the East African Regional program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This program is designed &quot;to bolster the capabilities of East African states (Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Uganda) to thwart Sudan- sponsored terrorism and the disruption of humanitarian assistance&quot; and &quot;to help these three countries resist Sudan-fostered destabilization.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A further $15 million in FMF funding would go to demining programs, including those being conducted in Angola, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Namibia, and Rwanda. The administration also proposes to allocate $7 million in FMF funding to create a new program, the Enhanced International Peacekeeping Capabilities (EIPC) program. This effort is intended to create peacekeeping training centers throughout the world to implement common internationally approved peacekeeping standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EIPC program would deploy American Mobile Training Teams and provide specialized training and equipment to participating military units, many of which will be from African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration's budget proposal includes a major increase in funding for the Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) account for voluntary peacekeeping activities. These funds include $10 million for the Africa Regional Peacekeeping program to improve the peacekeeping and conflict resolution capabilities of African countries preparing for regional or international operations conducted under the auspices of the UN, the Organization of African Unity (OAU), or on a bilateral basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This program would be directed at Botswana, Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe; the program is also intended to strengthen the capabilities of the Southern African Development Community to conduct collective operations. The funding would be used to provide the armed forces of these countries with training assistance and military equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another $15 million in PKO funding would be used--along with the $5 million in ESF mentioned above--to create an African Crisis Response Force. This money would be used to finance training and equipment for the military units of African countries that choose to participate in this American-sponsored effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An additional $3 million in PKO funding would be used to provide continued support for the OAU Mechanism for Conflict Resolution, Management, and Resolution. Since the Mechanism was established in 1993, PKO funding has been used to build the OAU Conflict Resolution Center in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and to provide equipment to help the center monitor crises and deploy observer missions. The funding requested for FY 1998 would be used to train center staff and observers for future operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the administration is seeking a significant increase in funding for International Military and Education (IMET) programs designed to train African military personnel both overseas and at U.S. military training centers in the United States. The proposed budget for FY 1998 contains $8.015 million to pay for IMET programs for the armed forces of sub-Saharan African countries, up from an estimated $7.325 million in FY 1997. This would be used to provide training to 1,081 students; the largest contingents are expected to come from Zimbabwe (120 students), the Central African Republic (78 students), Eritrea (75 students), Mali (65 students), Benin (63 students), South Africa (60 students), Ghana (60 students), Ethiopia (58 students), Madagascar (51 students), Rwanda (50 students), Sierra Leone (50 students), and Cape Verde (50 students).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is virtually certain, of course, that spending for most of these programs will be curtailed by the U.S. Congress, particularly in the context of the bipartisan plan to reduce overall federal spending in order to achieve a balanced budget.  For example, Representative Benjamin Gilman, chair of the House International Relations Committee proposes cutting $700 million from the international affairs budget for FY 1998, including a reduction in money for the Development Fund for Africa to $575 million. Expenditures for the ESF, FMF, PKO, and IMET programs will also probably be trimmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington, DC - The 19th session of the American Assembly -- held at Arden House in Harriman, New York, on 13-16 March 1997 -- was entitled &quot;Africa and U.S. National Interests,&quot; and was devoted to an examination of issues arising out of the Africa continent, how they affect U.S. national interests in the present and the future, and what policy the United States should follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 19th Assembly gathered 69 men and women representing government, business, academia, non-governmental organizations, the law, international financial institutions, labor, the military, religion, and the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The session was chaired by Donald F. McHenry (former U.S.  Ambassador to the UN and currently University Research Professor of Diplomacy and International Affairs at the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University). The project is directed by former U.S. Congressman Harold Wolpe (now at the Brookings Institution and serving as the Clinton Administration's Special Envoy to Burundi) and by former U.S. Ambassador to Zimbabwe and Tanzania David C. Miller, Jr., (now president of the Corporate Council on Africa).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 19th Assembly was designed as a prelude to the National Summit on Africa, a new campaign organized by Africare to expand and mobilize constituencies in the United States to press for a U.S. policy of engagement with Africa. The National Summit on Africa campaign begins operations this year with a series of regional meetings and will culminate with a major national event scheduled for 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report discusses U.S. economic interests and policy, political interests and policy, and security issues. The section on security issues presents several major policy recommendations.  Among other actions, the report argues that the United States should continue to support conflict resolution activities conducted by the OAU and sub-regional organizations by allocating resources, providing technical assistance, and encouraging UN support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report expresses uncritical support for U.S. military training exercises in Africa and for America's International Military Training and Education (IMET) programs in Africa. And it urges the administration to raise funding for IMET programs to $30 million (from the current level of less than $10 million).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report calls upon the United States to exercise &quot;forceful leadership&quot; in &quot;international interventions, military or otherwise . . . most often within the context of the UN&quot; in response to &quot;major humanitarian crises.&quot; And it describes the African Crisis Response Force proposed by the Clinton Administration as &quot;a mechanism through which the United States can recommit itself to the exercise of such leadership.&quot; However, it does not address the issue of whether U.S. troops should participate in these intervention operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to these recommendations, it is noteworthy that the section on security issues fails to discuss, or even mention, the issue of U.S. arms transfers to Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Final Report of the 19th Assembly was issued on 20 March 1997. Copies can be obtained from the American Assembly's web site at http://www.columbia.edu/cu/assembly or (free of charge) by contacting the American Assembly, Columbia University, Suite 456, 475 Riverside Drive, New York, NY 10115; by telephone at (212) 870-3500; or by fax at (212) 870-3555.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I. Introduction and Summary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Significant positive developments in Africa have recently created a sense of economic and political renewal throughout much of the continent. Over two-thirds of African countries are implementing economic policy reforms that emphasize growth, private sector development, and greater openness to the global economy. Aggregate growth rates for these 35 African countries in 1995 and 1996 averaged 5 percent, more than twice the rates of the previous decade. A new generation of leadership in Africa is promoting a reform agenda that offers important opportunities for rapid economic growth and increasing African countries' participation in the global economy. Now that an increasing number of African countries are becoming strong candidates as potential trade and investment partners, the United States should be at the forefront of the industrialized world in pursuit of these new opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recognizing the favorable economic and political trends occurring in most African countries, the Council on Foreign Relations -- while taking no position on the subject as an organization -- sponsored an independent Task Force of distinguished private citizens, committed to strengthening American ties with Africa, to make recommendations on how best to advance mutual U.S. and African interests in the sphere of economic relations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the renewal in Africa and the quiet expansion of U.S.  economic interests on the continent, the prevailing perceptions of Africa's potential remain overwhelmingly negative within parts of the policymaking and business communities, and among the larger American body politic. In the minds of many Americans, economic and political crises in a handful of traumatized countries have tended to obfuscate the impressive growth and political turnarounds occurring in many other African countries.  Consequently, the Task Force believes that new opportunities to increase economic ties with Africa will require considerable Executive Branch leadership if they are to receive the attention and support they deserve.  ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Task Force concludes that the U.S. needs a new economic policy for Africa which integrates trade and investment, aid, and debt reduction in a coherent manner aimed at expanding mutually beneficial economic ties. The Task Force notes with approval the recently increased attention given to African trade and investment issues by both the Congress and the Administration. However, the Task Force believes that legislative and executive initiatives fall short of offering a new economic policy for Africa that is as comprehensive as is warranted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New policy must more aggressively promote trade and investment and involve all relevant government agencies, while simultaneously strengthening our development assistance programs with those African countries demonstrating the strongest commitment to economic and political liberalization and poverty reduction. It must also promote the extinction of outstanding concessional bilateral debt and a more rapid application of the new debt reduction initiative of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Finally, a new policy must include the payment of outstanding U.S. commitments to those international organizations whose programs are critical to progress in Africa, as well as a willingness to work to improve the performance of these organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Task Force calls on the President and the Secretaries of State, Commerce, and Treasury, along with the U.S. Trade Representative and the Administrator of USAID, to focus greater attention and provide stronger collective leadership on new initiatives which transform the nature and content of U.S.  economic policies toward Africa. The Task Force calls upon Members of Congress to provide the Administration with the resources and support it will need to begin a new era of cooperation with an increasing number of African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Task Force is convinced that a new U.S. economic policy toward the countries of Africa should have as objectives, the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Increase U.S. two-way trade with African countries and American direct investment in Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Increase and strengthen U.S. development assistance in reforming countries to support sensible macro-economic policies and to help create conditions which will attract even greater investment, and produce greater trade</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Improve debt reduction as an important tool for restoring the credit-worthiness of African countries committed to economic and political liberalization and poverty reduction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Strengthen international cooperation in support of development in Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">II. Africa Today</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the dawn of this decade Africa has been experiencing profound social, political and economic changes that are carrying African countries into the new millennium with greatly improved prospects for economic development and growth. This renaissance is taking place amidst equally dramatic changes in the global political economy, and portends important opportunities for African nations to deepen their participation in the international system in numerous and mutually beneficial ways. The positive trends -- of democratization, economic reform, and settlement of long-standing conflicts -- characterize the present era as the most promising period since the onset of African independence 40 years ago. While the continent's continuing problems should not be understated, it is evident that we are witnessing the inception of Africa's second independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A failure to fully appreciate the economic aspects of this continent-wide renewal and their bearing on Africa's security and political interests will result in lost opportunities to maximize and sustain positive change in ways benefiting not only African nations, but the U.S. and the larger global community as well. In terms of America's national interests, it should be self-evident that as we become more dependent on the expansion of world trade for our own economic well-being, the potential for significant growth in Africa -- resulting in substantial new trade and investment opportunities at high rates of return -- merits aggressive U.S. economic engagement with the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">III. U.S. Economic Interests in Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">... U.S. trade with Africa is already considerable. For example, in 1996, U.S. trade with the 12 countries of Southern Africa totaled over $9 billion, a level comparable to trade with the 15 Republics of the former Soviet Union combined.  Significantly, U.S. exports to Africa have grown over 20 percent a year in recent years. In 1995, U.S. businesses increased their exports to Sub-Saharan Africa by 23 percent to a total of $5.4 billion, and in 1996 that figure rose to $6.1 billion.  Nevertheless, the U.S. market share in the region -- at 6.7.  percent -- lags behind Japan's 7.2 percent, and well behind the 30 percent share enjoyed by the European Union. Moreover, with imports from the region totaling $15.2 billion, the U.S. still runs a significant trade deficit while most of our European allies maintain a trade surplus with the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IV. U.S. Economic Policy Toward Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the first four decades of Africa's independence from colonialism, American foreign policy toward the continent was overwhelmingly influenced by global competition between the U.S.  and the former Soviet Union. Africa's economic development interests as well as American economic interests in Africa were largely marginalized because of the primacy of the Cold War. The end of the Cold War has led some policymakers to incorrectly conclude that there are no compelling reasons for continued U.S.  economic engagement in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until recently, U.S. economic policy toward Africa has depended on the provision of aid as the principle instrument for advancing U.S. interests. Though subordinate to Cold War imperatives, development concerns have also been a part of the motivation for U.S. aid to Africa. Whereas in the 1960s, the focus was on &quot;promoting growth,&quot; the decade of the 1970s witnessed a shift in emphasis to poverty reduction and meeting &quot;basic human needs&quot;.  During the 1980s, aid predominantly focused on support for &quot;structural adjustment,&quot; or stabilization programs, and trade liberalization to encourage economic recovery and growth. In the 1990s, aid has since shifted to promote good governance and political democratization as a precondition for economic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More recently the Clinton Administration has stated that the primary goal of U.S. economic policy toward Africa is to support sustainable development and to quicken the pace of that development, to boost U.S. trade and investment. In many ways, sustainable development embraces all of the primary objectives of the preceding decades and represents a better and more integrated understanding of Africa's development challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But regardless of the particular orientation of U.S. economic policy toward Africa over the years, its effectiveness has always suffered from the low priority it received within the prevailing foreign policy agenda and within the foreign policy bureaucracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, by limiting economic relations with Africa to those of aid-donor and aid-recipient, instead of promoting real partnerships utilizing a full range of aid, trade, investment and debt management instruments, the U.S. wrongly casts Africa as a region of little economic significance or potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frustrated by this legacy and cognizant of the economic dynamism now manifesting itself on the continent, legislators recently introduced proposals in the Congress which encourage reorienting U.S. economic policy by promoting American private sector involvement in Africa and increasing the role of trade and investment as vehicles for supporting African economic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, proposals to restructure and reduce the U.S.  foreign aid program raise serious questions about the future of U.S. aid to Africa (with the exception of Egypt). While economic assistance to Africa was regularly undercut by Cold War geostrategic and political issues, thereby retarding sustainable development, the post-Cold War period has been characterized by a sudden dismissal of development assistance on the grounds that it has achieved little positive development impact. This trend discounts the fact that efforts to reform aid and focus more on strengthening Africans' capacity to find their own development solutions are still in their infancy, and that aid has only recently been freed of its Cold War constraints. It also ignores the increased opportunities for more effective use of aid in countries that are implementing serious reform programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, the convergence of these developments (declining aid levels and increased interest in trade) has led to an often simplistic &quot;trade vs. aid&quot; debate over which is the most constructive approach for changing U.S. economic policies toward Africa. Fortunately, efforts to avoid this false dichotomy are evidenced in the revised legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the recent re-introduction of the African Growth and Opportunity Act in Congress, and the upcoming G-7 Economic Summit in Denver -- where new economic initiatives on Africa will figure prominently on the agenda -- there exists a new momentum for redefining U.S. economic policy toward the continent. The Administration is working to finalize proposals for a &quot;Partnership for Economic Growth and Opportunity in Africa&quot; that embraces most of the items proposed in the legislation. These developments, combined with U.S. support for the World Bank/IMF debt reduction program for Highly Indebted Poor Countries, offer key components for what should become a more integrated U.S. economic policy toward Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">V. Recommendations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Task Force is convinced that a new policy promoting economic relations with Africa must be driven more effectively by the White House than in the recent past, that it must strengthen the complementarity of development assistance programs and the new trade and investment initiatives, and that it must include new human and financial resource commitments to promoting greater U.S.  economic engagement in Africa. In addition, a new U.S. economic policy toward Africa necessitates both greater U.S. leadership on efforts to reduce Africa's unsustainable debt burden and payment by the U.S. of outstanding commitments to international organizations whose programs are critical to Africa's economic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, to create an expanded economic partnership with the African continent of significant mutual benefit to both Americans and Africans, the President with the cooperation of the Congress must broaden the proposed &quot;Partnership for Economic Growth and Opportunity in Africa&quot; program to include the following elements:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(details of recommendations available in full statement)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trade and Investment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* passage of an African Growth and Opportunity Act, (that increases African access to American markets, creates enterprise funds to mobilize greater American private sector investment in Africa, increases the number of posts within key federal agencies concerned with U.S. economic policies toward Africa, creates a U.S.-Africa Economic Forum, and initiates planning for free trade agreements with African countries or groups of countries) ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investments in Sustainable Development</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">... The Task Force is convinced that there is a strong continuing role for bilateral development assistance to Africa and that current aid levels should be increased. Specifically, in order to reverse the decline in U.S. aid levels to Africa at a moment when it is more likely to be used more effectively than ever before, the Congress should authorize and appropriate up to $1 billion for the Development Fund for Africa and the African Development Foundation in each of the next five years. The Task Force believes that while more emphasis is needed on promoting trade with Africa and U.S. private investment in Africa, the United States must expand its sustainable development programs to help reduce poverty, to strengthen democratic governance and the rule of law, and to invest in human resource development, all of which are necessary to help Africa create the economic base needed to meet global competition for export markets and investment funds, and to sustain economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">... The United States must also pay outstanding American commitments to the International Development Association, the African Development Bank and Fund, and the United Nations in order to carry a fair share of international cooperation in support of African development, and to maintain leadership in shaping the global economy. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Debt Reduction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* a commitment to push for an accelerated, improved and flexible implementation of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) framework for debt relief in Africa with an emphasis on restoring the credit worthiness of strongly reforming countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the period of eligibility for multilateral debt reduction should be reduced from six years to three years</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the debt sustainability threshold ratios for debt service should be lowered to 15-20 percent and for debt-to-exports to 150- 200 percent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">V. Conclusion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African renewal, as described earlier in this statement, while largely self-generated, will nevertheless require significant international support and enhanced development cooperation if it is to be sustained. Such cooperation is equally important to the larger international community itself. The old notions of &quot;aid donors&quot; and &quot;aid recipients&quot; must give way to more relevant concepts which emphasize partnership and encompass the full range of areas of economic cooperation including trade and investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the U.S., the crumbling of the old conventions that sustained foreign policy throughout much of this century, and the need to redefine the national interests that will guide it into the future, should offer Africa new opportunities for greater engagement with the United States. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Realistically, however, this moment of opportunity could easily be lost. Indeed, the low priority that continues to be given to African affairs by Washington despite this convergence, as well as the unchanged staple of negative stereotypes of Africa that continue to predominate American attitudes toward Africa are discouraging. These factors underline the need for new and innovative efforts to address the prevailing misperceptions of Africa's progress and of its importance to the U.S. and the global political economy as a whole. ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Statement of the Task Force reflects the general policy thrust and judgments reached by the group, although not all members necessarily subscribe fully to every finding and recommendation in the Statement being released today. Some members may choose to register additional views in the final published document. The council takes no institutional position on policy issues and has no affiliation with the U.S. Government.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations - The Security Council this afternoon urged all parties in Burundi to continue pursuing a negotiated settlement of their conflict and refrain from actions that might harm such dialogue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement read out by its President, Park Soo Gil (Republic of Korea), the Council welcomed both the talks being held in Rome to complement the Arusha peace process on Burundi and the Burundi Government's commitment to a comprehensive dialogue among all the parties within the framework of that process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reiterating its support for the peace efforts of leaders of the region, the Council welcomed their decision to ease sanctions against Burundi to alleviate the suffering of its people. That decision was relayed to the Council in the Joint Communique of 16 April issued following the Fourth Arusha Regional Summit on the Burundi Conflict held in the United Republic of Tanzania.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stating its concern that instability continued in Burundi despite recent positive developments, the Council recalled its resolution 1072 (1996) of 30 August 1996, which demanded that all sides in Burundi declare a unilateral cessation of hostilities and initiate unconditional negotiations towards a comprehensive political settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expressing deep concern at the involuntary resettlement of rural populations, the Council called upon Burundi's Government to allow the people to return to their homes without hindrance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting began at 12:07 p.m. and adjourned at 12:12 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential Statement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The full text of the statement, to be issued as document S/PRST/1997/32, reads as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Security Council is concerned that, despite recent positive developments, there is continuing instability in Burundi.  It recalls its resolution 1072 (1996) of 30 August 1996, in which, inter alia, it demanded that all sides in Burundi declare a unilateral cessation of hostilities and initiate unconditional negotiations with a view to reaching a comprehensive political settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Security Council reiterates its support for the efforts of the regional leaders and takes note of the Joint Communique (S/1997/319) of 16 April 1997 issued following the Fourth Arusha Regional Summit on the Burundi Conflict held in Arusha, Tanzania.  In particular, the Council welcomes the decision of the regional leaders to ease sanctions in order to alleviate the suffering of the people of Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Security Council welcomes the fact that talks are being held in Rome which are complementary to the Arusha process. It also welcomes the commitment of the Government of Burundi to the comprehensive political dialogue among all the parties within the framework of the Arusha process. It urges all the parties in Burundi to continue to pursue a negotiated settlement and to refrain from actions which are detrimental to such dialogue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Security Council expresses its deep concern at the involuntary resettlement of rural populations and calls upon the Government of Burundi to allow the people to return to their homes without any hindrance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Security Council expresses its support and appreciation to former President Nyerere as well as to the Special Representative of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity in their efforts to find a peaceful solution to the crisis in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to continue to keep the Council informed on the situation in Burundi, especially with regard to the progress of a negotiated and peaceful settlement in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations - The Office of Internal Oversight Services would send auditors and investigators to Arusha and Kigali in September to check improvements in operations and efforts to address management errors in the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary) was told this morning (May 30).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presenting his Office's reports on the Tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia and on the United Nations Postal Administration, Under- Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services Karl Theodor Paschke said that some of the major problems found in the Rwanda Tribunal had been addressed and remedial action taken in a number of areas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the former Yugoslavia Tribunal, he said his Office had recommended cuts of at least $6 million from its 1997 budget. The content of the former Yugoslavia Tribunal report differed from the one on Rwanda because it had been inspired by Member States' concerns about the steep increase in its resource requests, rather than allegations of irregularities and mismanagement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saudi Arabia's representative said the unreliable financial records in the Rwanda Tribunal were a matter of concern. On the Postal Administration, he asked the Secretariat to report on the cost-sharing for space between the United Nations and the Postal Administration.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Today, more than two millions workers responded to the call by COSATU for a 24 hour general strike in support of demands for better conditions of employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all cities and towns, workers also attended marches and rallies, except in KwaZulu natal where a stay away was called.  Reports thus far indicate that well over a quarter of a million attended rallies and marches to hand over memoranda to Business South Africa and its affiliates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of these workers come from within the ranks of COSATU and NACTU or are unaffiliated and unorganised. Unlike bosses who are often playing golf, these are the people who work between 45 hours and 60 hours a week, enjoy very little or no parental rights and whose basic conditions will be varied down if the current bill was to be passed as is.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's strike is the third since the 1994 elections. All of them has been aimed at forcing employers to accede to the humble demands of workers on legislative issues pertaining to improvement of working conditions and worker rights. For the record, the previous ones were on the LRA and the constitution respectively.  In all occasions, employers have advanced positions that stand in the way of democratic transformation, including the extension of democracy in the workplace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As is often the case, most commentators have claimed that today's action means that the Alliance is about to collapse. In spite of the support we have received from the ANC, SACP and SANCO, they imply that the strike is staged in opposition to the government. Nothing can be further from the truth. The Alliance is united on the need to eradicate apartheid at the workplace and to extend worker rights and conditions that have systematically been denied over many years of oppression and exploitation. Contrary to protestation by employers, they were willing partners in our oppression and exploitation at the workplace, a situation that they would want to see continue under a new dispensation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC and the Communist party have supported the need for the broadest mobilisation of workers in support of the need for progressive legislation. In a move that stunned political commentators, President Mandela marched with workers in support of a revamped LRA. He also led us in our meeting with business to press home our opposition to the lock-out during the drafting of the constitution. In general, legislative proposals by the government are aimed at correcting the imbalances and injustices of the apartheid era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our approach to the Basic conditions of employment bill</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As COSATU, our strategy is informed by the fact that the primary aim of the statute is to overhaul the current law to give effect to the new constitution, as well as provide a floor of basic rights for all workers. This law will regulate contracts and basic conditions for most workers particularly the vulnerable and the unorganised.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COSATU's demand is for a 40 hour working week. We would welcome it coming into effect immediately, but have placed on the table a compromise position to have it faced over a period of not more than 5 years. The phasing in should be spelt out in legislation as well as appropriate and effective mechanisms to achieve it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We acknowledge the proposal to reduce working hours to 45 hours with immediate effect as well as the phasing in for mine workers, security guards and agricultural workers. The number of workers who will benefit from this reduction will be more than 2 million workers most of whom are unorganised or vulnerable. The reduction should however be spelt out in the statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MATERNITY LEAVE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We re-iterate our demand for a 6 months maternity leave of which at least 4 months should be paid. We have noted the increase in the bill from 3 to 4 months, job security as well as increased coverage.  We however remain of the view that the provisions for payment and the duration should be contained in law. We do not accept the current situation where women are prejudiced with respect to UIF benefits after their dismissal soon after returning from maternity because their UIF benefits have been exhausted while on maternity leave. As a movement committed to women equality, we will fight this one to the bitter end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VARIATIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We remain opposed to the proposed model on variation as contained in the Bill, particularly in relation to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the potential of &quot;downward variation&quot; under the guise of &quot;flexibility&quot;, which would be an erosion of workers' basic rights;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the extensive discretion of the Minister to vary (including potentially downgrade) the basic conditions of workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many have said that we are against the provisions on variations because of our opposition to GEAR. Even if there was no GEAR, we would still take the same approach. It is employers who regards the same provisions as necessary for the success of GEAR.  I am of the view that they are using GEAR for convenience. If there was no GEAR, they would have invented it. It after all what is contained in their Growth for all. What they hide behind is international competition.  This was their approach in the previous disputes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SUNDAY WORK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We reject the employers' demand that Sunday work be regarded as a normal day. In this regard we agree with the government approach even though there are areas that require tightening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OVERTIME PAYMENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We accept the government proposals on overtime payment.  Business should withdraw their ridiculous proposals since they will never see the light of day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHILD LABOUR THRESHOLD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While we are pleased with the definition of a child in the Bill, We however remain of the view that the threshold for child labour should be 16 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The message from workers has gone out loud and clear! We will not accept anything short of the above demands. The ball is now formally in the court of the employers. We expect them to respond to us with revised proposals either directly or through NEDLAC.  Their failure to do so will lead to the continuation of our actions. Furthermore, we will be setting a deadline for the conclusion of negotiations in NEDLAC.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - LIBERIA: CONTINUING HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES BY PEACE- KEEPERS MUST END AS NEW DEMOCRATIC ERA DAWNS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately ending the culture of impunity which has infested Liberia for years must feature high up on the agenda of the country's first democratic government in eight years, due to be elected on 19 July, Amnesty International said today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement follows an official welcome by the government, political parties and non-governmental human rights organizations of Amnesty International's recommendation to establish an independent human rights institution with the powers to investigate complaints of human rights violations and to carry out human rights education programs, as proposed by a delegation during a recent visit to Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was also a general consensus that the police, military and prison system needed restructuring and training in international human rights standards on law enforcement,&quot; the human rights organization said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil society organizations and certain former faction leaders said they would welcome a Truth Commission, similar to that operating in South Africa, to inquire into the atrocities committed against the civilian population in Liberia. Some also called for the creation of a War Crimes Tribunal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Massive human rights abuses were inflicted on Liberia's 2.8 million people during its bloody civil war, lasting from 1989 to 1997. About 200,000 Liberian people were killed, over 700,000 became refugees, and an estimated 1.4 million people are internally displaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The importance of finding out the truth is imperative; not just for victims and survivors of human rights abuses, but for the future of Liberia. Only when the issue of past human rights violations is addressed can there be enduring peace and true reconciliation in Liberia,&quot; Amnesty International said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International is also concerned about continuing human rights abuses by soldiers from the West African peace-keeping force, ECOMOG, who presently carry out regular law enforcement functions in Liberia. For example, one person was recently beaten to death and four others tortured by peace-keepers who were supposedly looking for weapons in Lajoy village in Grand Cape Mount County.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The use of force had nothing to do with self-defence and everything to do with intimidation, interrogation and a blatant disregard for humanitarian and human rights law,&quot; Amnesty International said. During its mission, Amnesty International delegates met other victims of ECOMOG brutality who reported beatings and torture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) in 1995 was entrusted with the mandate to investigate and report on human rights violations. Amnesty International is disappointed that despite repeated complaints of human rights violations committed by the armed factions and the ECOMOG peace-keeping force UNOMIL has not issued detailed public reports of these investigations to the UN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Security Council was informed in March that the UN had sent ECOMOG details of allegations that ECOMOG soldiers had mistreated former fighters and civilians during weapons-recovery operations but no action has so far been taken by the Economic Community of West African States or by the ECOMOG peace-keeping operation to follow up these allegations,&quot; Amnesty International said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are also alarmed by the fact that no real steps have been taken to ensure that ECOMOG respects the rights of detainees or those who are questioned. In the absence of a Status of Forces Agreement, ECOMOG appears to be operating outside any legal framework and detainees remain at risk of ill-treatment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the call from the UN Commission on Human Rights for human rights monitors to be deployed at least during and after the elections, so far there are no plans for such deployment.  There are currently only three United Nations human rights officers investigating and reporting on human rights violations throughout Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Proposals for a substantial increase in the human rights presence need to be drawn up as soon as possible. A needs assessment mission should also be undertaken to consider what sort of technical cooperation and advisory services can be offered to the new police force, the army, judiciary and local human rights organizations,&quot; Amnesty International said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - Amnesty International United Kingdom (AIUK) today launched a new campaign with the publication of Refugees - Human Rights Have No Borders, a report calling on the world's governments to fulfill their international obligations for the protection of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the scale of human rights violations that force people into exile continuing and the number of people needing international protection rising, states are going to great lengths to prevent asylum-seekers entering their territory. The campaign aims to raise public awareness of how people become refugees and the link with human rights violations as a major cause of flight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over 200 local AIUK groups will take part in the campaign.  Many will be leafleting the public on Saturday at major airports and ports of entry in a national day of action.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the UK, the organisation is urging the new Government to ensure that its commitments to a &quot;faster, fairer and firmer&quot; asylum process will translate into truly fair and efficient procedures, dispelling the &quot;culture of disbelief&quot; amongst those making decisions on asylum cases. In 1996, of the 38,960 decisions taken in asylum cases only 6% were granted refugee status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As detained asylum-seekers around the country protest against the unfair and arbitrary detention of asylum-seekers pending the outcome of their claim, AIUK is calling on the Government to review this practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While welcoming several of Labour's commitments to tackling aspects of the current asylum system, AIUK is calling on the Government to carry out a wide-ranging review of the asylum process, including a reinstatement of benefits for all asylum applicants and an end to the inordinate delays in the processing of applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AIUK welcomes Labour's commitments not to operate the &quot;white list&quot; of designated countries where there is perceived to be in general no serious risk of persecution but to look at each case on its individual merits. It also welcomes indications that discrimination against those who have entered the UK via a third country will end, guaranteeing all asylum applicants an in- country right of appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, these steps have not yet come into effect. In fact, the removal of asylum-seekers to third countries was suspended on 8 May only to be resumed on 9 May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BACKGROUND: THE INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Internationally, governments increasingly show a callous disregard for the impact of policies deliberately designed to prevent people who are genuinely fleeing persecution from reaching safety in their countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are more than 15 million men, women and children refugees and a further 20 million people internally displaced because they have been forced to leave their homes but have not crossed an international border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1951, in the aftermath of the Second World War, states formulated the Refugee Convention in order to deal with the mass outpourings of people. One of the key principles spelled out in the Convention and general international law is that of non- refoulement -- that no one should be forcibly returned to a country where his or her life or freedom would be at risk .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governments have made the rules on the refugees and they should now play by those rules,&quot; Amnesty International said. &quot;The increasingly restrictive approach that more and more governments take towards refugees makes a mockery of their international and national obligations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This restrictive approach includes limiting access to their countries, harshly applying asylum criteria, detaining asylum- seekers, temporarily protecting or forcibly repatriating refugees, and fining airlines and shipping companies if they carry people who do not have travel documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While governments may have the right to control their borders, they do not have the right to refuse people access to asylum procedures,&quot; Amnesty International said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International's message is simple. No-one wants to be a refugee. Refugees are the product of human rights violations and their rights should not be further violated when they seek asylum.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - An Amnesty International high level delegation led by Secretary General Pierre Sane arrives in Nairobi on 1 June 1997 for a 12-day visit to Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegates will be meeting with representatives of the government, political parties and non-governmental organizations to discuss the Amnesty International's concerns about the human rights situation in the country and Kenya's role in human rights protection elsewhere in Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation will be launching Amnesty International's Human Rights Manifesto for Kenya, and calling on all political parties to include human rights protection and promotion in their manifestos for the forthcoming general elections. Amnesty International is particularly concerned about harassment of critics of the government, ill-treatment -- sometimes amounting to torture -- of political prisoners, prison conditions and what appears to be the use of excessive force by Police. The delegation will be calling on the government to bring Kenya's constitution into line with international standards on human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the visit the delegates hope to meet representatives of the government, including President Daniel Arap Moi, the Attorney General and Home Affairs Minister. The delegation will also meet representatives of political parties, the Kenya Human Rights Commission, the Law Society of Kenya, the National Union of Journalists and non-governmental organizations and religious communities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - Rampant political violence is only one of the factors standing in the way of a free and fair Algerian election on June 5, Human Rights Watch/Middle East charges in a report issued today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media censorship, restrictions on categories of parties, the hasty promotion of a new pro-government party, and widespread repression against suspected Islamists, their families and sympathizers all weigh heavily on voters as they go to the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the thirty-five page report, &quot;Algeria: Elections in the Shadow of Violence and Repression,&quot; which is based on a two-week mission to Algeria in April, Human Rights Watch condemns grave human rights abuses committed both by the security forces and by armed Islamist groups. The report describes how the terror and repression have intimidated Algerians of varying political persuasions from becoming politically involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those in power in Algeria have proclaimed their hope that these elections will erase the taint they incurred when the last legislative elections were cancelled in 1992. They have claimed that the vote will culminate the restoration of democracy, and have invited foreign election observers to monitor the process.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch cautions, however, against viewing the June 5 election as the capstone of the process of establishing democratic rule in Algeria. If these elections are to be a step toward ending the political stalemate, significant additional steps will be required for the Algerian people to be able, in a meaningful way, to exercise their human right to &quot;take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives.&quot; This right is central to Algeria's political crisis, since it was the denial of that right during three decades of one-party rule and when authorities annulled the country's first multi-party legislative elections which led to the political violence becoming endemic, and which has diminished in the eyes of many Algerians the legitimacy of those who govern them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch calls on the international community to monitor not only the elections themselves, but conditions in Algeria after the elections, and to press the government to curtail human rights abuses and to respect fully the rights of freedom of expression, association and political participation.  Aid and partnership agreements with the government of Algeria should be linked to measurable progress in these domains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report describes the following factors coloring the legislative elections, the first affecting what is at stake and the others detracting from the extent to which they should be considered free and fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A weakened National Assembly: The Assembly to be elected on June 5 is a far weaker body than the one that was to have been chosen in 1992. The new constitution, drafted by the authorities and approved in a controversial November 1996 referendum, has stripped the assembly of many of its lawmaking powers, while strengthening the office of the president and creating a second legislative chamber, one-third of whose members are appointed by the president and two-thirds of whom are elected by local officials who themselves will have been been elected by popular vote. While international human rights standards do not dictate how power should be divided among different branches of government, it is important to note the significantly reduced powers of the institution that is being elected through popular suffrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ongoing political violence and repression: Although many Algerians have courageously and defiantly plunged into the campaign, the rampant violence, for which the security forces and armed Islamist groups are responsible, continues to claim scores of lives each week and has terrorized many Algerians who would wish to express their views or take part in political life.  Political activists from a wide range of parties and tendencies have been assassinated since 1992, including at least five so far in the run-up to this legislative election. The report contains testimonies of Algerians who have been victimized by the security forces and by violent opposition groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exclusion of parties: Certain provisions of the 1996 constitution and 1997 political parties law violate the right to freedom of association by not permitting parties based on religion, region, language or gender. The Islamist Salvation Front, the movement that was poised to win the last legislative elections, was outlawed in 1992 and remains barred from any political activity. Other parties have been required to change elements of their names and program in order to comply with the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Restrictions and favoritism: Authorities have to some extent restricted the political activities and coverage on state- controlled radio and television of some legal parties, particularly those that criticize the interruption of the last legislative elections. By contrast, the authorities have facilitated the rapid rise of the National Democratic Rally (RND), a party formed in February to mobilize support for the President and his government and which is running candidates in all districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media censorship: Although the Algerian print press is more free than many in the Middle East and North Africa, systematic censorship in the press of security-related news and, to a lesser extent, of criticism of government corruption and performance, deprives voters of information concerning some of the key issues in this campaign. The authorities have harrassed publications and journalists associated with independent print media, and have preserved state-controlled television as a government mouthpiece.  The ability of journalists to gather and disseminate news and information has also been impeded by the unprecedented assassination campaign that has cost the lives of fifty-nine media workers since 1992. Armed opposition groups are believed responsible for most of these killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Human Rights Watch report addresses a series of recommendations to the government of Algeria, the countries sending election observers, and to the European Union and its member states. Human Rights Watch also makes recommendations to the armed groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the government of Algeria: -End censorship and pressures on the media that aim to enforce a state monopoly on information related to the internal security situation, including human rights violations, or that aim to restrict other coverage that displeases government officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-End all measures designed to impede the peaceful activities and public expression of political parties and movements, including those that urge the inclusion of the FIS in negotiations with the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Bring domestic legislation on political parties into conformity with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights by abolishing the prohibition on parties based on religion, gender, race or region. Such broad-based prohibitions violate the right of Algerians to freedom of association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Take steps to halt human rights abuses perpetrated by the security forces, including arbitrary detention, &quot;disappearances,&quot; extrajudicial executions, and torture, that target suspected Islamist activists, their relatives, and suspected sympathizers.  Such abuses are presently praticed with virtual impunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the armed groups: Human Rights Watch urges all armed groups to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Halt immediately deliberate attacks on civilians and noncombatants, and indiscriminate attacks that disregard the protection of civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-Cease all activities intended to threaten or intimidate persons because of their personal or political beliefs or activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Persons empowered to speak on behalf of the FIS, as a movement with aspirations to political power in Algeria, should clearly and unconditionally condemn attacks by armed Islamist groups against all civilians and other acts that violate basic human rights and humanitarian norms. These include all acts and threats of violence intended to intimidate Algerians who wish to exercise their right to political participation and association. Leaders of the FIS should utilize whatever influence they have over armed groups to end violence against and intimidation of civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the European Union and Member States:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union is presently negotiating a Euro- Mediterranean Association Agreement with Algeria similar to ones already signed between the E.U. and Morocco, Israel, and Tunisia.  Algeria hopes to obtain financial aid or debt relief in the context of this accord. Article 2 of each association agreement states, &quot;Respect for the democratic principles and fundamental human rights established by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights inspires the domestic and external policies of the (European) Community and of (the other party) and constitutes an essential element of this Agreement.&quot; Human Rights Watch makes the following recommendations to the European Union and member states:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-The European Commission and Council of Ministers, and E.U.  member states, should scrutinize not only the June 5 elections but also human rights conditions in the months that follow the elections, and make clear to the Algerian government that improved relations depend on the government's making tangible progress in improving in human rights practices and in giving greater substance to the right of Algerian people to participate in self-governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-In particular, the European Commission and Council of Ministers, and E.U. member states, should monitor the extent to which the elections represent a starting point for the government to redress some of the outstanding human rights issues for which authorities are responsible, such as the hundreds of cases of &quot;disappearances.&quot; They should publicly acknowledge and condemn these practices by Algerian authorities, and submit lists of names of reportedly &quot;disappeared&quot; persons that come to their attention and request clarifications from Algiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-The European Commission and Council of Ministers, and E.U.  member states, should assess whether state broadcasting media remain open to opposition views, as they have to a degree during the election campaign, or revert to their rigid practices of recent years, and whether the print press is allowed real freedom. They should further monitor whether the policy of granting visas relatively freely in the run-up to elections to journalists and foreign observers, including human rights monitors, will revert to the more restrictive past policy on visas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-The European Parliament should adopt an urgent resolution, making reference to Article 2 of the draft Association Agreement with Algeria, requesting the European Commission and Council of Ministers to undertake the above recommendations and to report back to the Parliament with regard to these undertakings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-The European Parliament should itself undertake to document human rights developments in Algeria in the post-election period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Countries Sending Election Observers: Those countries participating in the multi-national election monitoring effort have a responsibility to provide a frank and public assessment of the atmosphere for free and fair voting, despite the difficult conditions on the ground faced by their observers. The lackluster and silent monitoring of the 1995 Algerian presidential elections by the Arab League, Organization of African Unity and the United Nations enabled the authorities to boast of the international presence without any having to face thorough monitoring or public reporting by the observers. This time, governments and multilateral institutions sending election observers must not forfeit the leverage for improvements that their presence offers.  They should take steps to ensure that their observers are able to have access to potential sources of pertinent information regarding the free character of the polling, including restrictions on basic civil and political rights for all Algerians. They should ensure that their observers are able to speak publicly and promptly concerning conditions. If the observers travel with armed escorts from the security forces, assigned for their protection, they have a duty to weigh the deterrent effect this will have on ordinary citizens and party activists who might otherwise approach them with complaints about irregularities, and should identify means of enabling these potential sources to meet with them in private in order to provide them with information pertinent to the elections. If the armed security personnel are assigned against their express wishes, or if other obstacles are placed on their access or activities, observers should publicly state that such constraints can impugn the freedom and fairness of the elections themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, foreign governments that maintain contact with representatives of the FIS should demand, as a condition of such relations, that the FIS take specific and visible steps to implement the above recommendations that are addressed to it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa had to be seen to ally itself with the poorest of the poor and, in international relations, with those people struggling for self determination. There were limitations on what it could do about situations far from its borders.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Harry Viljoen has one bit of advice for Carel du Plessis, who goes into his critical first hands-on week as Springbok coach: don't even think of trying to beat the Lions by taking them on wide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Du Plessis has shown a strong inclination to promote creative back-play, but Western Province coach Viljoen is adamant, after seeing his team lose 38-21, that a wide game is not the way to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we are going to have to try and take them up front, trying anything else might be suicidal,&quot; said Viljoen. The Lions and the Boks meet for the first time at Newlands on June 21.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All my backline players spoke highly of the Lions backs, and that includes James Small,&quot; said Viljoen. &quot;I don't think we can beat the Lions by spreading the ball, because I think they have our number at the back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viljoen's views dovetail with those of his most impressive player on Saturday, Andrew Aitken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Province No 8 was also clearly impressed by the Lions' ability to run slide-rule angles into open space. &quot;Their lines of running were extremely good, as were their ball skills,&quot; he said.  &quot;It would not surprise me one bit if the Lions reached the first test unbeaten. The scrum is the key area for them now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that the two WP men believe the Lions are soft up front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viljoen says, however, there may be some deficiencies in the Lions' body positions when they go into the loose scrums and the Boks could exploit these. Aitken has similar reservations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They've got to get that scrummage sorted out,&quot; said Aitken.  &quot;If they try to run the ball in retreat against the Springboks they'll find themselves in real strife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must go in low and work them from all angles,&quot; said Viljoen. &quot;The way to beat them is to take the ball in close and work our way through at the fringes. We must try and turn them around in the forwards and we must establish some control over them before trying to move the ball down the backs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Province coach said his team had tried to work this plan at Newlands, but had achieved limited success because &quot;we simply didn't have the players to do it&quot;. However he says the Boks have the material to play the game he envisages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the Lions stars of Saturday, Tim Rodber, said, however, the tourists were not worried about their scrumming. &quot;The trouble was that we took on our scrumming task as individuals and not as a pack, but that can be sorted out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lions forward coach Jim Telfer explained the difference in scrumming between South African and British sides. &quot;British teams tend to go down and then relax before the ball comes in, while South Africans maintain the intensity after the hit. That is something we warned the players about beforehand, but there is nothing like first-hand experience to drum the message home,&quot; said Telfer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile the Lions will be strengthened this week with the imminent arrival of England flyhalf Michael Catt from Argentina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Catt, who scored 21 points in England's 46-20 win over Argentina on Saturday, will replace injured Paul Grayson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Catt was considered by many to be a surprise exclusion from the original Lions tour squad and many British critics consider him a superior all-round player to the more kicking-orientated Grayson.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Plans are afoot to see Cape Town get another luxury five-star hotel - this time a high-rise one, in the form of the upper 15 floors of the landmark BP Centre on the Foreshore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was revealed by Neil Bernstein, managing director of the Devland Group, which recently bought the building at the bottom of Long Street from the Mine Officials' Pension Fund for about R100-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The German property company Avanta has a stake in the Devland Group and former Lonhro chief Dieter Bock is a major shareholder in Avanta.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BP Centre recently lost its anchor tenant of 20 years, BP South Africa, largely because of the of the building's outdated fire safety measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bernstein said any future plans for the building would also include a R4-million overhaul of the fire safety equipment, including sprinkler systems on all floors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bernstein confirmed that the company was investigating the possibility of turning the top 15 floors into a 300-room hotel aimed at business executives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refurbishment of the building, including the subdivision of the top 15 floors into hotel rooms, is expected to cost in the region of R120-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An American and a European hotel group have expressed interest in the operation of the hotel, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigation is expected to be completed within the next two months but Mr Bernstein said &quot;chances are very good&quot; that the plans for the hotel would be realised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The building is ideally situated and suited for a hotel. It has 10 lifts, good parking ratios and superb views of Table Mountain, Signal Hill and the bay area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the BP building was tilted at a 45-degree angle which ensured views through and above other buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any buildings to be constructed on the old power station site on the Foreshore would not affect the views from the top floors because of a 60m height restriction. The BP Centre is about 100m high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the hotel plans are realised it will be open for trade by September next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on the possible over-saturation of the luxury hotel market in the city, Mr Bernstein said: &quot;We have to take a long- term view and anyway our hotel would obviously be up much quicker than the other hotels&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the planned hotel does not go ahead, the entire building will be substantially upgraded and transformed into a five-star office block.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Cape Town's new city manager Andrew Boraine has delivered a report on his first 100 days in office in which he focuses on the deep divisions wrought on the city by apartheid</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Cape Town's new City Manager Andrew Boraine asked some people during his first 100 days in his new job what their five top priorities were, they told him: &quot;Housing, housing, housing, housing, and housing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his report to the Cape Town municipality, he also pointed out that there were more than 250 000 people in the city who could lay claim to land restitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It should come as little surprise that housing should have emerged as the top priority of the city's people and Mr Boraine deserves praise for having enunciated their views so succinctly in his first report.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His concern over housing delivery and the lack of a housing policy, budget or administrative capacity will find wide resonance in a city which faces an unprecedented and growing inflow of people from many parts of the country and from abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Boraine's relationship with Cape Town is still very new, and the real test of his ability to manage the city's affairs will not be merely in identifying its problems - which are duplicated in almost every town and city of the country - but in finding effective and practical solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That will be discouragingly difficult at a time when budgets everywhere are extremely tight, are likely to remain so for a long time to come, and when expectations are running high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Boraine and his team have set a commendable pace in their first 100 days, but the many challenging days that lie ahead will call for innovation and leadership and the support of all communities in a bold and exciting endeavour to restore unity to the greater Cape Town community and shape a brighter and more equitable future for all its citizens.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Hopes for a breakthrough at the &quot;bosberaad&quot; workshop for Irish political leaders at De Hoop have been boosted after political foes socialised at the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegates from nine Irish groups - including Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, and the militant pro-British unionists - attended a party on Saturday night, at which there was drinking and folk singing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roelf Meyer, the former National Party cabinet minister who is one of the chief facilitators of the workshop aimed at helping Irish leaders find a peaceful settlement in their country, described the party as a breakthrough.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was socialising. There was a get-together of a social nature by all, but it did not mean they were talking to each other,&quot; Mr Meyer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mandela and his partner Graca Machel visited the workshop on Saturday and urged delegates to find a way of overcoming their differences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provincial Affairs and Constitutional Development Minister Valli Moosa said yesterday the workshop was proceeding smoothly.  The Irish delegates were willing to learn from South Africa's transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I detected a distinct willingness from the parties. I feel the delegates present here are in favour of a real negotiated settlement,&quot; Mr Moosa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had a sense that the Irish parties had set aside time to be here and participate in this workshop because of the need they have for a settlement. We found a real willingness for some movement from it. It would be presumptuous to say this would make a decisive impact on the thinking of negotiators in Ireland. Only time will tell if it has been of value or not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Meyer said the workshop had gone very well and could help lay the foundations for peace talks in Northern Ireland. &quot;I think there was some progress. I hope their visit here will make a difference. Maybe it will help them go home with a more constructive approach to each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There had been good interaction among most of the parties but delegations from the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had initially refused to have anything to do with Sinn Fein. The workshop was nearly derailed within minutes of its start on Friday when the leader of the UUP delegation, David Trimble, walked into the dining hall where Sinn Fein chief negotiator Martin McGuiness was standing. The angry unionists threatened to leave, but the organisers quelled the tensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To keep the antagonists apart, separate accommodation, bars and dining facilities had to be organised. South African negotiators also had to hold separate briefings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were strong reservations on the side of the unionists and that meant interaction did not really take place. But as far as other parties were concerned, it was good,&quot; Mr Meyer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believed the workshop had further enhanced South Africa's stature on the world stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it was very important that South Africa could utilise this opportunity and that we were asked to do it.&quot; The conference ends today.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The confrontation between the National Party and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission increased today with a formal NP demand that TRC deputy chairman Alex Boraine resign forthwith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demand was reportedly delivered to the TRC with a threat that the NP would take it to court if Dr Boraine did not leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Nat-supporting newspapers, an NP letter also demanded an apology from TRC chairman Desmond Tutu, for remarks he made after the NP's second submission last month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archbishop Tutu would not respond yesterday, saying he had heard nothing from the NP yet and was not prepared to &quot;discuss the matter through the media&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter refers to the TRC's allegedly biased and aggressive handling of NP leader FW de Klerk during and after the NP's second submission to the commission last month. It threatens the TRC with legal action unless:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Archbishop Tutu apologises unreservedly for his remarks and undertakes to stick to the letter of the TRC legislation, which demands even-handedness from members of the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Dr Boraine resigns immediately as deputy chairman and commissioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Glen Goosen, head of the TRC's investigative unit, undertakes never again to be involved in any investigation of the NP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NP spokesman Anneke Greyling confirmed the letter would be handed to the TRC today, but would not elaborate on legal steps the NP was considering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NP has previously expressed its anger over the TRC's handling of its submission, claiming commissioners' questioning of Mr De Klerk was too aggressive and revealed bias. The ANC representatives, in contrast, were handled with kid gloves, the NP said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal experts were perplexed about the legal action which the NP might take, pointing out that the party's claim of bias was largely a matter of opinion on which most courts would be reluctant to rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given the nature of the TRC's work, and the fact that it is largely focused on the deeds of the former NP government, it would be extremely difficult for the NP to prove bias or unfair treatment,&quot; a senior advocate commented today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In any event, no court is going to tell the commission that Dr Boraine has to resign, or that certain TRC commissioners may not deal with certain matters. That is not the role of a court.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The next round in the fight between Liberty Life and the other members of the powerful Life Offices Association has been postponed to July when a special meeting will decide on action against Liberty, accused of breaking the rules on payment of commissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LOA's management committee has decided to recommend Liberty be suspended until the end of August.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberty's payment of fees to brokers who use its new Blueprint system has drawn the fire of fellow assurers, who accuse the group of breaching the commission regulations under the Insurance Act as well as the association's code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Competitors claim the R120 payment for entering information on clients in the company's computerised Blueprint financial needs analysis programme is an extra commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberty says the fee is not a commission but a payment to sales staff for work previously done by administrative staff, whose numbers were cut when the programme was introduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement after Friday's management committee meeting, the LOA said a panel had found that Liberty was in breach of the code.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of a possible contravention of regulations under the Insurance Act should be dealt with by the Registrar of Insurance, the LOA said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The association has appointed a sub-committee, headed by Marius Smith of Metropolitan Life, to investigate the question of commission payable to intermediaries and to decide whether or not the regulations and the code should be amended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the July meeting the management committee will recommend that Liberty be &quot;strongly reprimanded&quot; for breaching the code of conduct and that it should be suspended from the association until the Marius Smith committee reports on August 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee hoped Liberty would change its mind and adhere to the code until it was &quot;properly amended&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Unions today threatened to intensify mass action against the Basic Conditions of Employment Draft Bill if the Government refuses their demands for a 40-hour working week and six months' maternity leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Confederation of SA Trade Unions deputy-president, Connie September, issued the warning to the Cape Argus before an estimated 5 000 marchers set off from the Grand Parade to deliver memoranda to the SA Chamber of Business and the Department of Labour offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Cosatu's executive committee would meet later this month to discuss the planned action. &quot;If nothing happens between now and June 24, Cosatu will take a decision to intensify rolling mass action,&quot; she said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosatu called today's countrywide marches and a 24-hour general strike in a bid to compel the business community and the Government to accept its argument for a 40-hour working week and six months' maternity leave, four months of which is to be paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town marchers said the unwillingness of business to listen to Cosatu had forced them to strike. &quot;We will strike again and again until they listen,&quot; said marcher Shanaaz van Blerk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clothing industry, one of the region's biggest employers, was virtually at a standstill today as 70 percent of its workers heeded the strike call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The majority of factories have reported high levels of absence,&quot; said Johan Baard, chairman of the Cape Clothing Manufacturers' Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere the response was mixed. Early today, Charl Adams of the Cape Chamber of Commerce and Industry said that there appeared to be &quot;patchy&quot; support for the strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One large employer with 11 000 staff members had been unaffected, while a technical company reported an 80 percent stayaway at one branch but full attendance at another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Essential services appeared largely unaffected by the stayaway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Golden Arrow bus company reported a 14 percent stayaway by staff who were members of the Cosatu-affiliated Transport and General Workers Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public relations officer Jeanne Welsh said most staff were members of the Transport and Omnibus Workers Union, affiliated to the National Council of Trade Unions (Nactu), and all had reported for duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Metrorail spokeswoman Riana Jacobs said there had been &quot;a 100 percent turn-out&quot; of staff and that the numbers of passengers appeared normal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliament operated on a skeleton staff after members of the Cosatu-affiliated National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union (Nehawu) downed tools in mid-morning and joined the stayaway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nehawu represents about 70 percent of Parliament's unionised workforce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the region's biggest unions - the SA Municipal Workers' Union (Samwu) - announced it would join the Cosatu march from 1.30pm today after briefing staff about a successful wage deal struck last week. But it would maintain essential services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere the response was mixed. Johannesburg services did not appear badly hit, but in Port Elizabeth and Uitenhage, municipal services ground to a halt .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAPE TOWN - The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)'s investigating team has found yet another Apartheid era death farm near the conservative town of Groblersdal in Mpumalanga and are still investigating for more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking from the TRC's head office in Cape Town, the head of the investigation unit, Dumisa Ntsebeza, told African Eye News Service (South Africa) on Saturday that the farm is between Groblersdal and Dennilton, and used was used as the headquarters of the notorious Mbokodo gang that terrorised and killed a number of political activists in former KwaNdebele homeland.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can not confirmed yet whether the farm was used as a torture centre or as a secret cemetery to bury the bodies of murdered activists,&quot; said Ntsebeza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the TRC's intelligence service team was still investigating additional leads about the farm's history after receiving a tip-off from a former member of the South African Defence Force (SADF)'s intelligent section.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe that by the end of June our investigation into this farm and a number of others will be complete,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ntsebeza added that there are basically three types of apartheid 'death farms', namely the death centres themselves where people were killed and buried like Vlakplaas, or interrogation centres were activists were tortured and lastly cemetery farms where murdered activists were secretly buried after being killed during interrogations elsewhere.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new range will be primarily exported to South Africa but will also be sold in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The joint manufacturing agreement follows a series of contracts between Fridgemaster and Samsung aimed at expanding both their presence in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A similar multi-million rand deal between Zimbabwe's Delta and FridgeMaster was also announced last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FridgeMaster has already sent a team of technicians to Korea as part of the Samsung agreement, to participate in the final design and initial production phases of the frost free range of fridges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the new fridges have been undergoing tests over the past month, including 'impact evaluation'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This involves dropping the shop packaged fridges from heights of up to six feet evaluate the effects of 'Third World conditions', such as delivery vehicle accidents or rough handling would have on the new product. FridgeMaster will exclusively handle the first phases of local production of the new product at its Manzini factory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new range was supposed to have been launched in February but both parties decided to postpone the launch until the durability testing had been completed.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Group chairman of Nedcor, Chris Liebenberg, forewarned both national housing minister, Sankie Mthembi- Mahanyele and Mpumalanga Premier Mathews Phosa that the banking group was firing &quot;Mr Housing&quot;, Kevin Gibbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also told them that Nedcor was investigating a series of &quot;highly unethical&quot; irregularities allegedly committed by Gibbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lienbenberg told Sunday Times on Saturday that the 'courtesy call' to Mthembi-Mahanyele had been made before she travelled to Mpumalanga to open Motheo Construction's R205-million rural housing project.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scheme is currently being investigated by the auditor general following allegations that it is costing the government R33-million more than it should, that it was awarded to Motheo before the company officially existed and that Motheo's founder and director, Thandi Ndlovu, is a close friend of Mthembi- Mahanyele.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The controversy about the scheme, first revealed by the Mail &amp; Guardian, has already cost national housing director general Billy Cobbett his job after he objected to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phosa was informed about Gibb's impending dismissal after the launch and told Liebenberg that the suspension would not affect Mpumalanga's housing programme as the government dealt only with institutions and not individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Liebenberg stressed that Gibb's suspension and subsequent dismissal were not directly related to Motheo, he did say that the two page list of charges were &quot;definitely highly unethical&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gibbs himself has the two page letter listing the charges but he is refusing to publicly disclose them so we cannot either,&quot; explained Liebenberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The charges are in connection with internal regulations which Gibbs broke but I don't know if they would be considered criminal - they are however definitely highly unethical.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insisting that the calls to Mthembi-Mahanyele and Phosa were not designed to warn them against either Motheo or the rural housing project itself, Liebenberg said that he had decided to warn the politicians simply because he knew that Gibbs had had close dealings with both their departments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did not telephone anyone else about the issue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Steenknamp found Maseko lying slumped over the live power line, as if he had died in the act of cutting the cable,&quot; said police spokesman, Captain Blackie Swart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We strongly believe that Maseko, who was unemployed at the time of his death, mistook the electric wire for copper-wire and was killed while trying to steal it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swart added that Maseko's wife had last seen her husband alive ten days ago, on the night of May 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't know exactly when he died yet, but the body was already decomposing despite the bitterly cold weather. It appears he lay there for a long time.&quot; Meanwhile, Telkom reported on Sunday that it has spent over R100 000 trying to repair or replace telephone lines which had been damaged by copper thieves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 24-hour toll-free number has been established for members of the public to report any copper theft in their areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Callers may remain anonymous and are in line to receive a reward, should the information they supply lead to convictions.  The number is 0800 1108 30.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - Defeated Swapo vice presidential candidate, Prime Minister Hage Geingob, yesterday expressed the hope that his participation in the race for the post had strengthened the democratic process within the ruling party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geingob, who was pipped at the post by the incumbent, the Rev Hendrik Witbooi, drew 41 per cent of the vote from delegates at the ruling party congress in Windhoek.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement yesterday, Geingob warmly congratulated Witbooi on his re-election and assured him of his continued support &quot;in the challenges he faces in the restructuring and strengthening of the party to prepare it to lead Namibia for many years&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prime Minister said he was proud to have contributed to the evolution of a new culture of public debate of issues by candidates without mudslinging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In that sense, with the culmination of the congress, the party has come out stronger and more united than ever before to work for the benefit of all Namibians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have lost the elections, but it is my hope that the democratic process has become strengthened further,&quot; Geingob said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said that he hoped he had exposed, once and for all, those critics who claimed he did not have a constituency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that I secured some 41 per cent of the votes at the congress clearly shows that I do have a strong constituency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remarkably, this constituency comprises all the thirteen regions of our country,&quot; Geingob said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prime Minister also congratulated President Sam Nujoma &quot;on his well-deserved, uncontested election as the President of the Swapo Party for another term&quot;. Undoubtedly, he added, under President Nujoma's guidance, Swapo would forge ahead with its commitment to building a better Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geingob also thanked all those who had supported him, campaigned and voted for him. He particularly singled out Minister of Lands, Pendukeni Ithana, who had &quot;courageously&quot; nominated and motivated his candidature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witbooi, who drew 58 per cent support from the 337 delegates, was nominated by the President of the National Union of Namibian Workers (NUNW), Ponhele ya France.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - The new Swapo Central Committee could face credibility problems following claims that the voting procedure was &quot;a complete mess&quot; with confusion reigning throughout the early hours of Sunday as the counting took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the Central Committee which was announced at the close of the Swapo Congress included only seven women out of the 58 elected candidates - a slap in the face for President Sam Nujoma's appeals for greater gender equality in the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some regions failed to get any of their nominated candidates onto the ruling party's key decision-making body, while a number of well-known party faces did not get in and three deputy ministers failed to make the final cut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The voting for the CC was dogged by problems and apparent incompetence from the outset.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voters were given a list of names with corresponding numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegates then had to list the 58 numbers out of 122 candidates they preferred on a ballot paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, several party sources said the procedure was severely flawed and questioned whether the result could be regarded as free and fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There appeared to have been two different lists of candidates with some having different numbers on each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Festus Naholo's name appeared twice on some lists (Nos 29 and 47), while an apparent third Hardap candidate, Marlene Mungunda, was said to have been completely missed off the list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adding to the confusion, already-elected officials such as President Sam Nujoma, Hendrik Witbooi as vice-president and Hifikepunye Pohamba as Secretary-General appeared on the lists, although they had already been assured of seats on the CC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegates claimed that according to the proper procedure the results of the elections for the other posts should have been announced before the CC vote, thereby preventing delegates from wasting their votes on candidates who had already secured CC seats by virtue of their offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one point in the early hours of Sunday it appeared as if there was a possibility that the CC election would be declared null and void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the results were eventually announced shortly before 05h00.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not clear yesterday if some of the ousted candidates would call for a new election to take place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numerous delegates awaiting the outcome of the CC vote also bitterly bemoaned the lengthy delay and confusion, and questioned the organisation of the CC vote. &quot;It should have been simple and straightforward,&quot; was a frequent complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the vote officials last night dismissed the charges of confusion and procedural irregularities as of no consequence, and said that as far as he knew no official complaints had been lodged as yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are always typographical errors,&quot; the official told The Namibian when approached for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he maintained that these had had no effect on the final outcome and that the Central Committee election had been &quot;more democratic than ever&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No-one can claim they were disadvantaged,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegates would have ignored names appearing twice, the official added. He also dismissed the possibility that the existence of at least two versions of the list would have affected the final vote, or the possibility that some Central Committee candidates having different numbers on different ballot sheets would would have influenced the final outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Namibian was unable to contact the chief presiding officer for the CC poll, Dr Albert Kawana, for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of regions failed to get their nominated candidates onto the Central Committee, including Hardap, Karas, Khomas, Oshikoto and Otjozondupa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seven women elected are Libertina Amathila, Netumbo Ndaitwah, Saara Kuugongelwa, Pendukeni Ithana, Gertrude Kandanga, Clara Bohitile, and Linea Shaetonhodi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were 17 women candidates out a total of 122.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab topped the CC list with 246 votes out of a possible 337, followed by Ministers Jerry Ekandjo, Ben Amathila and Libertina Amathila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New faces who did particularly well included Nangolo Mbumba who came 11th, Asser Kapere who finished 12th and Ignatius Shixwameni who came 14th.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Hage Geingob finished in 23rd position with 188 votes, while unionist Jacob Nghifindaka gave a strong showing at 21st in the list with 189 votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were also some well-known figures who failed to make the final 58. Deputy minister of youth and sport, Hadino Hishongwa, will not feature in the new CC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also out are deputy Environment minister Nangolo Ithete and deputy transport minister Klaus Dierks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from the three deputy ministers, out went Peter Mweshihange, Iyambo Indongo, Ida Jimmy, Otto Herrigel, and MPs Pashukeni Shoombe, Walter Kemba, Willem Konjore, Angelika Muharikua, Brave Tjizera, Siegfried Wohler and National Councillor Josephine Hamutwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already on the CC by virtue of their office are the secretaries of the Women's Council, Elders Council and Youth League - Erica Ramakhutla, Kanana Hishoono and Paul Kapia - plus the president, vice-president and secretary-general of the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President also has the right to nominate six extra members of the CC, bringing the total to 70. He is likely to come under pressure to make all his choices women to even up the gender imbalance slightly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not clear if John Pandeni as deputy secretary-general will automatically have a place on the CC as this is a new post.  He may have to be nominated as one of the six presidential candidates.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - The battle for the vice-presidency of Swapo proved to be the dominant issue at the party's second congress in an independent Namibia, which drew to an end in the early hours of yesterday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final result, announced after a marathon final session of the congress, was a comfortable but not overwhelming victory for the incumbent, Hendrik Witbooi, who gained 58 per cent of the delegates' votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Hage Geingob picked up 41 per cent of the vote - a respectable result which answered his critics who have claimed he had no support base within the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end it appears that delegates' votes were not decided on the basis of ideological or policy differences between the two candidates, nor their post-independence achievements, but on their personal styles.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The energetic campaign launched by Geingob, which included widespread lobbying and full page newspaper adverts, appeared to backfire to a certain extent, with a number of party delegates preferring Witbooi's less sophisticated approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geingob is a much more vigorous political personality than Witbooi and is not afraid of bluntly telling people when he thinks they are wrong or are not performing well enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congress insiders said some senior MPs, including cabinet ministers, voted for Witbooi not because they were completely positive about his candidature but because they were tired of the Prime Minister's dominating political style and found Witbooi less threatening. In this sense Witbooi was something of a compromise candidate representing the status quo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically Witbooi was voted back in on the strength of the northern vote while many southern delegates backed Geingob.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Party sources said that many northern voters backed Witbooi, while hoping that a candidate from the North will emerge at a later stage to either contest the vice or presidential positions.  However, party sources, even those who voted for Witbooi, said that Geingob was unlikely to be severely damaged by his loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, by challenging Witbooi he is being credited with opening up a new political culture of democracy within the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION OF SUCCESSION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witbooi's victory still leaves open the question of a successor to President Nujoma. While Witbooi is clearly a respected figure in the party, many feel that he is not in the final analysis 'presidential material'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this sense his victory does not make him the 'heir apparent' for the party's leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather it opens up the question - with the 'silent man' of this congress, Hidipo Hamutenya, now emerging as a stronger contender after President Nujoma's third term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEBATE SHORT ON MUSCLE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the contest between Geingob and Witbooi was historic in the sense that it set a precedent for democratic elections for Swapo leadership positions, there were other aspects of the congress which were less encouraging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The congress was held in unnecessary secrecy with journalists kept waiting outside the Showgrounds for most of the gathering.  There were no official media briefings during the Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was also apparently little meaningful debate on policy issues and most of the resolutions passed on Government's record and plans appear fairly perfunctory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Little was made of the slow progress on land reform or other areas where Government performance could be criticised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time there were few bold new initiatives or policy ideas which appeared to come out of the congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally the chaos of the Central Committee vote was indicative of a general air of disorganisation surrounding the congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a more positive note, the Central Committee put forward a number of proposals for reforming the internal workings of Swapo, which include ensuring that it becomes a party based on a paid-up membership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New party secretary-general Hifikepunye Pohamba will face a major challenge in implementing these plans, and many at the Congress expect him to stand down from his ministerial position to concentrate on building up the party's administration.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - THE Swapo Congress endorsed a Central Committee proposal to ensure that President Sam Nujoma is allowed to serve a third term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Central Committee recommended that the Constitution be changed so that the first President of Namibia is able to serve two terms of office &quot;upon a mandate by direct popular vote&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The motion put forward by the Central Committee said the first term of office served by Nujoma should not be regarded as a term of office in relation to the Constitution's limitations on the number of terms served.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Nujoma was elected by the Constituent Assembly and not by popular vote in the 1989 election (which was only for parties).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He won his first mandate by popular vote in 1994 in the presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wording put forward by the Central Committee makes it clear that only Nujoma will be allowed to serve three terms and subsequent presidents of Namibia will be limited to two five-year terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The motion also endorsed Nujoma, as the Swapo President, to be the party's presidential candidate for the next elections scheduled for 1999</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its preamble to its motion, the Central Committee cited Nujoma's &quot;long and unbroken history of tested leadership qualities&quot; and his role as the &quot;founding father of the nation&quot; as reasons for motivating a third term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of Information Ben Amathila told NBC-TV last night that a committee had been set up to work out the exact legal mechanism through which a third term for Nujoma could be assured.  It is then expected that the proposal for amending the constitution will be brought before the National Assembly where it will require two-thirds backing from MPs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Congress also resolved that an extraordinary congress should be convened during 1998 to consider amendments to the Swapo constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resolution said &quot;there is a strong feeling that the party's political and physical infrastructure&quot; had to be closely re-examined to maintain &quot;the party's cohesion&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amendment proposals need to be submitted to the Central Committee six months before the holding of the extraordinary congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NBC-TV reported last night that congress also passed a resolution calling for women to make up 30 per cent of candidates for the Central Committee at future congresses and 50 per cent of candidates for future national elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi (APS) - The present dearth of information in Africa might soon change into a market of affluence, hopefully by next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And this ambitious initiative is being undertaken by the WorldSpace Incorporated, a US-based company whose Chairman and Chief Executive Mr. Noah Samara is convinced education and information sharing among Africans in Africa would be the key that liberates the continent's immense potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born of a Sudanese father and an Ethiopian mother, Samara established WorldSpace in 1990. By 1995, the company had acquired licences to operate satellites in Africa, the Middle East, Central America, the Caribbean and Asia, with a potential audience of 4.5 billion people. The project has an investment of about $1 billion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WorldSpace is, however, launching its first satellite, AfriStar, in June 1998 and the first major conference on its use will focus on education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the WorldSpace system is designed to cater for all forms of audio broadcasting, the initial thrust is being put on education because of its dire need on the continent. Whereas there is a will to raise literacy levels in affected parts of Africa, economic policies enforced by the World Bank/International Monetary Fund (IMF) have not only meant that fewer and fewer parents can afford the high cost of sending their children to school, but also governments are unable to subsidize and expand their educational services such as building and equipping classrooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samara says his investment grew out of a desire to spread information throughout Africa, having recognised the deficiencies in the system. He only added the Middle East, Caribbean and Asia to the project in order to achieve economies of scale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Distance education, a relatively new concept in Africa, would therefore enjoy a boost when AfriStar becomes operational in June next year. Samara's project comes in handy at a time when most countries in Africa are desperately seeking means of opening up new frontiers for learning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ghana for instance, efforts have been made to institute a nation-wide distance education programme in the country.  Currently, tertiary institutions admit less than 40 per cent of qualified applicants because of limited space on campuses, not to mention fees that are beyond the reach of the average person.  This situation usually brings in disappointment to many homes at the beginning of each academic year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot continue making such a large number of intelligent people who are capable of pursuing university education feel they are not good enough to be given admission,&quot; says Ghana's President Jerry John Rawlings, who admits he is very much disturbed by the trend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pressed to do something about the situation, the government in 1996 approved a nation-wide distance education programme to help solve the problem. &quot;Preparations are now far advanced for its implementation this year,&quot; assures Prof. Dominic Agyemang, Chairman of the Distance Education Council in Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the agencies that are supporting Ghana in setting up its distance education project are the Commonwealth of Learning, Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), British Overseas Development Agency (ODA), French government and the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). UNESCO has pledged US$40,000 towards the provision of equipment for the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ever-increasing demand for education at all levels and the realisation that every person needs to continue to learn throughout life, has led policy makers and educationists to turn more and more to open learning and distance education. For Ghanaians in particular, distance education is indeed very significant to their aspirations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country has set itself the task of achieving free compulsory basic education for all her citizens of school going- age by the year 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has also been engaged in a functional literacy programme since 1991 with the objective of reaching more than 5 million people with useful education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are enormous tasks and the introduction of such a vital information system like the WorldSpace will help us accelerate our pace and achieve our objectives,&quot; said President Rawlings when he opened a three-day conference on Technology and Distance Education dubbed, Opening New Frontiers For Learning in Accra late April this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference which focussed on the use of radio to spread education and information rapidly and cheaply through the length and breadth of Africa was sponsored by Ghana's Ministry of Education, Canada-based Commonwealth of Learning and WorldSpace Incorporated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It provided opportunities for organisations and educationists to reflect on experiences in the field of distance education and ways of bringing education to a wider audience. The conference also attested to the commitment of WorldSpace to distance education and development and deliberated on how to use WordSpace's formidable technology in order to spread education throughout the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WorldSpace's Samara, who gave a presentation, noted that the satellite innovation can change the quality of life in Africa.  Programmes can be tailored for virtually all needs, taking into account local languages, cultures, degrees of awareness and interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The price for a basic receiver is expected to be around $150 although WorldSpace is hopeful that as economies occur, the price can be reduced to between $20 and $30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WorldSpace recognises radio as the best instrument for information and mass education for the deprived regions. &quot;Our commitment is to provide access to our technology to enable people to improve their lives,&quot; says Samara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, enhanced access to information is vital if people are to make informed choices. This would also assist the people of the deprived world regions to address the critical problems of literacy, health, civic education, women's issues, child survival and environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since conventional means such as building more schools are not simply feasible in Africa any more because of cuts in budgetary allocations, it is opportune that Africa embraces the concept of distance education so as to receive its spark of life. Currently, educational needs are multiplying but the ability to serve these needs are diminishing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The participants were quick to note that partnership is perhaps the best means of assisting in this ground breaking endeavour and called for the pooling of resources to make the concept a reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without knowledge, Africa indeed, faces further marginalisation, they reasoned, since it remains one of the most poorly served regions in terms of information.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kinshasa - The powerful Congolese (formerly Zairean) opposition party, the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) of veteran opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi seems to have committed a timing error by rushing to challenge the victorious Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) of the new Congolese leader Laurent Kabila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are reports of severe internal strains within the UDPS following the failure of the mass strike action called on May 26.  Another demonstration by pro-Tshisekedi groups on May 28 was squashed by soldiers loyal to Kabila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers note that the first strike action against the one- week old government of &quot;President Kabila&quot; failed completely when millions of workers, civil servants and shopkeepers heeded the new government's warning of severe disciplinary action on anybody getting involved in such demonstrations. There are clear indications that further protests will be suppressed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila appears determined that if Mobutu could keep the opposition in semi inactivity, there is no real reason he should not be similarly respected given the immensity of the tasks ahead such as providing new roads, education and medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu's 32 year dictatorial rule destroyed the entire infrastructure of Zaire, renamed Democratic Republic of Congo after Laurent Kabila seized Kinshasa on May 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue at stake is the failure by the 58 year-old self declared President Kabila to name Tshisekedi Prime Minister with power to appoint his own cabinet. The new government charged that Tshisekedi had rejected an influential cabinet post on May 23, and demanded the premiership, a post the new president has now abolished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers predicted that the &quot;ville mort&quot; or dead city strike actions planned in Kinshasa by the UDPS would fail precisely because such moves were not politically justified so early in Kabila's self appointed term of office (as yet unspecified).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics are convinced some of the Congolese who previously supported the UPDS in its long running face- off against Mobutu's government may now see an alternative in the ADFL. Consequently they may see no reason, Mobutu having been driven out on May 17, to begin a confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the view of supporters of Maliba Kibasa, a rival of Tshisekedi in the UDPS, whose faction is willing to allow Kabila a reasonable transition period before passing judgement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tshisekedi, several times premier under Mobutu both before and after the Sovereign National Conference in 1991, has invoked the anger of Zairean and Rwandese Tutsi who form the core of the original Banyamulenge fighters who started the struggle to remove Mobutu in eastern Zaire, seven months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamulenge fighters as well as Kabila still view him with a lot of suspicion since he was the first to initiate fundraising activities to help the government of Mobutu fight the rebellion in the east soon after it started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In effect Tshisekedi, 58, may himself face a severe acid test in face of the new realities in Congo. He had been advised by former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere &quot;to take whatever post was offered and not be choosy.&quot; Nyerere advised Tshisekedi that he could not rightfully demand a specific post and expect the President to comply. Later President Mandela of South Africa and Ugandan leader Yoweri Museveni both supported Kabila's decision to abolish the post of Prime Minister. Both leaders are powerful players in the regional power equation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tshisekedi has substantial support in his home province of Kasai. On May 24, there were demonstrations in solidarity with him in the important diamond mining town of Mbuji Mayi in Central Kasai, but the ADFL soon extinguished them. The fear now is that his ostracism from power circles in Kinshasa could serve to create ill feelings between the people of Kasai and Kabila's own Katangese of south-eastern Congo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deposed President Mobutu caused great animosity between the two ethnic groups when his government orchestrated ethnic killings targeting Kasai people in Lubumbashi in the early 90s as part of the destabilisation of the &quot;wind of change&quot; sweeping across Congo and other African nations. The point is that in any future general elections in the new Congo, Kabila will need to have cultivated the trust of the Kasai people whether or not their son is in the political picture in Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kasai people and the churches in the province were often more outspoken against Mobutu than many others. Kabila will also have to cultivate the friendship of the churches in Zaire where the episcopate in both the Catholic and Protestant churches were often seen as too close to Mobutu. These include the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Kinshasa Cardinal Etsou, Archbishop Bokeleale of the Church of Christ in Zaire (CCZ) and the leader of an indigenous church movement called the Church of Jesus Christ on Earth (CJSK) - the Kimbanguists, Simon Kimbangu. These leaders among many others, reportedly regularly enjoyed the patronage of Mr. Mobutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a paper entitled Churches and the Struggle for Democracy in Zaire, Pastor Kabongo-Mbaya, a Congolese Sociologist and theologian observes: &quot;Few bishops were really opposed to Mobutu; many were said to depend on financial aid from him as the decolonization of missionary work left some bishops insecure.  Foreign grants and donations went to heads of religious congregations who, legally speaking, could in no way be required to render accounts to Zairean bishops (Catholic).&quot; The same thing could be said of all other leading denominations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Archbishop of Kisangani Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya faced a severe test when in early May he returned to Kinshasa from Belgium, indeed being branded &quot;Mobutuist,&quot; after the pro-Mobutu National Assembly voted him speaker of a proposed Transition Assembly. The ADFL of Kabila and the UPDS of Mr. Tshisekedi saw it as a ruse for Mobutu to deny imminent victory to Kabila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their bone of contention was that Monsengwo had abandoned and betrayed the people of Zaire when he succumbed to pressure and quit his post as speaker of the Sovereign National Congress on December 6, 1992. In that post, Monsengwo was the de facto leader of Zaire with the lofty title of President of the High Council of the Republic. Kabila will have to patch up with all these forces in the new Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already he is not doing too badly in trying to alleviate the burdens people face. School fees has been reduced from US$100 to $60 in parts of Zaire as a means to get more children into primary school. Moreover in many parts of Zaire, extortion by soldiers demanding bribes at road barriers have been eradicated to a large extent. These steps will endear him to any future electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While in Kinshasa over the last two weeks, he has mainly kept out of public sight following reports of numerous &quot;hit squads&quot; reportedly paid for by the deposed leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest involves a group of British mercenaries who allegedly intended to kill him in Lubumbashi, near Zambia's northern border. The report, carried in the May 18 edition of the Times of London claimed Zambia would have been the staging post for the attack. Denying the allegations, Zambia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement in Lusaka on May 26; &quot;It is inadmissible thatZambia should be associated with machinations&quot; to further destabilize the Central African region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi (APS) - With Namibia's independence and the end of apartheid in South Africa marking the realisation of pan- Africanist Ghanaian Kwameh Nkrumah's dream of a liberated Africa, there is hope that the ugly images that speak for this region can be put to shame and make room for a continent that promises life with dignity for its people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such were the aspirations of African delegates meeting in Midrand, Johannesburg, under the auspices of the World Council of Churches (WCC) to focus on a new vision for their continent, built on the people's willingness to work together, manage their human and natural resources responsibly and ethically, create linkages and be in partnership with one another and nature, mindful of generations who bequeathed such inheritance and those behind who deserve an even better inheritance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The May 10-17 JUBILEE AND THE AFRICAN KAIROS; AN ECUMENICAL VISION AND AGENDA FOR LIFE conference, organised by WCC's Unit III - Justice, Peace and Creation, was a milestone in a process initiated by the WCC in 1991 under the theme, Africa through new eyes. The conference was also a culmination of a programme established in 1995 with the aim of creating opportunities for the Church in Africa to engage in dialogue with the African society and promote active solidarity with Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 100 delegates drawn from some 25 African counties mainly comprised African Christians representing their respective churches, national councils of churches (NCCs), civic bodies, trade union and government sectors and one representative from a Muslim community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subjects discussed focussed on Faith and Politics, the Gospel and Culture, Mission and Partnership and Faith and Economics.  These themes provided a background against which to critically assess the African Church and its moral standing and relevance to a continent that yearns for a practical spirituality that respects its people's needs and aspirations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stories of life with dignity narrated by the young and old, women and men, portrayed lives shaped by the embodiment of pan- Africanism in Ghana, belief in the liberation struggle despite untold sacrifices in Zimbabwe, determination to continue fighting for life and dignity inspite of a protracted war against Christians and Africans in the Sudan, and the enjoyment and aspirations of liberation from the decades-long yoke of apartheid in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What probably made the Jubilee and African Kairos conference unique was its deviation from routine conference thesis presentations to personal accounts and reflections on Africans' understanding of life in a given setting. This format in a way brought real life into the WCC conference, presenting living examples of historical recordings and statistics. Discussions were then formed from comments and questions raised by fellow participants, and formalised with follow-up group discussions whose recommendations were reported on at the plenary sessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegates heard stories of life that were mutually inspiring and challenging while others were horrifying and appalling.  Sudanese Rev. Clement Janda, Director of the Mindolo Ecumenical Centre, in Kitwe, Zambia told of the enduring pain and cries of the people of Southern Sudan where &quot;Africa's longest and forgotten war continues. From August 1955, I have seen so much war and killings....&quot; was the Sudanese brief description of his experiences in his country. He went on to clarify that Sudan was actually the first African nation to gain independence from the colonialists' British/Egyptians on January 1, 1956, which was soon followed by its first military coup in 1958.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan enjoyed relative peace from 1972 to 1983, thanks to a permanent constitution, but the civil war that erupted in 1983 is still going on, viciously targeting mainly African and Christian Southerners since the country is governed under sharia (Islamic) law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clement Janda's life like that of millions of fellow southern Sudanese, has been characterised by displacement from one area to the other, hunger, the pain of seeing loved ones killed in the war, loss of community and family stability and living in exile.  &quot;Sudanese are everywhere in neighbouring countries. Our faith, be it Islam, Christianity or African traditions is our crime,&quot; he said. And went on to clarify that not all Muslims want to oppress non-Muslims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obviously saddened by the lack of international publicity over the &quot;killing fields&quot; in his country, Rev. Janda is nevertheless inspired by the commitment of churches and other organisations to intervene in the hope of ending the war and suffering. &quot;The churches in the Sudan are united in a vision of a Sudan free from sectionalism, troubled-yes-but not destroyed. For 43 years we have been waging war, there is every reason for that conflict to b concluded,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar stories were told by two fellow Sudanese, who requested anonymity, fearing that publicity on their part would cause problems for them back home. In emotional encounters, the pair told of their lives on the run, sufferings undergone by women and children in slavery. &quot;We are living in Sudan as temporary citizens on contracts, because being Christians and (Black) Africans, we do not have any citizen's rights,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other varying experiences of struggles with political systems were heard from Zimbabwe, Kenya, Uganda, Central African Republic, Cameroon, Togo, Zambia, Angola, Tanzania, Mozambique and the Gambia among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The birth of democracy in South Africa and the process of reconciliation undertaken by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission provided a great source of inspiration and challenge to the world and the rest of Africa. Events in the Great Lakes region, especially the struggle in Zaire against Western backed dictatorship is an example of initiatives of a search for regional solution to regional problems. These experiences, for the participants at the Johannesburg meeting, were part of the unfolding African Kairos (Africa's moment of opportunity).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recommendations drawn from discussions on Faith and Politics drew the attention of the Church to its obligation to inject a new moral culture into politics. &quot;The church should therefore use its moral authority to preach and pressure political and religious activists to be involved in a system of good governance and management based on sound democratic principles,&quot; the meeting stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Church leaders were also urged to seriously reflect upon and strive to promote the virtues of integrity and accountability and to be an example to the flock and society at large in order to restore the declining moral authority of the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegates also acknowledged the existence of conflict resolution structures and mechanisms within the AACC and WCC, but said these should be revitalized and used more widely to create fora that can bring together political and religious leaders to negotiate with opposition groups in times of severe tensions, among other recommendations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Gospel and Culture there was general consensus on the need for inculturation and contextualisation of the Gospel, that the spirit of tolerance and diversity should be fostered as a means of attaining unity at national and community levels and that the church should recognise gender and gender related problems from the point of view of the women and take practical means aimed at addressing injustices founded on decadent cultural assumptions and values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reflections on Faith and Economics challenged churches to put in place structures that have justice as the fundamental basis for economy and strengthen their own capacity to engage in economic discourse by embarking on economic literacy programmes as a way of demystifying economic language. As an integral part of the economic reality of each nation, the church was reminded of its duty to encourage accountability and transparency in the conduct of economic affairs in African states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recommendations on Mission and Partnership generally commended existing co-operation between and among various ecumenical partners, but emphasised the need to spell out clearly the working relations between the AACC and WCC at their General Assemblies to be held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in October 1997 and Harare, Zimbabwe in September 1998 respectively, in order to bring about more effective stewardship of resources and avoid duplication of projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both AACC and WCC were also commended for their initiatives to address the conflicts in East Africa's Great Lakes region from an ecumenical perspective with a view to seeking a peaceful resolution and finding a common solution to related problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is true, delegates agreed, that Africa is home to numerous ills that threaten and deny the very existence of both private and public life as evidenced in domestic and sexual violence in the private and corruption in the public sphere. But these realities were a source of renewed commitment not despair, for the African churches and communities represented at the Jubilee and African Kairos conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They committed themselves to collect information on cases of domestic and sexual violence (femicide) for presentation at the AACC and WCC assemblies respectively and for use thereafter. Too, they would gather information on cases of corruption in their respective countries and churches, and creatively document the same for presentation at the WCC assembly and further use, and encourage networking with existing groups that are engaging in combatting sexual violence and corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sudan, the participants, having heard testimonies of the sufferings endured by Southern Sudanese, committed themselves to stand by the Sudanese people, defend their right to freedom, form groups of solidarity for the systematic dissemination of information relating to the development of the situation in that region and mobilise all possible means &quot;in our power in order to help the victims of the Sudanese conflict enjoy a life with dignity.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DOUALA (APS) - The leader of the Catholic Church in Cameroon Christian Cardinal Toumi has called for an overhaul of his country's Electoral Commission, asserting that this is the will of the Cameroon people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview on the African Service of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) on May 27 here, the Cardinal lamented that the whole structure associated with the electoral process in Cameroon - where parliamentary polls were conducted on May 17 - was deliberately designed for dishonesty and to favour President Paul Biya's ruling Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (RDPC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cardinal Toumi said: &quot;The wish of the people of Cameroon is to see the establishment of an independent electoral commission.&quot; He did not vote in the controversial May 17 parliamentary elections as he was time barred due to a haphazard regulation that says the registration period ends when the date of elections is announced.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provisional results show Biya's RDPC got 114 out of the possible 180 seats. The official results will be proclaimed before June 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cardinal Toumi insisted that millions of young people who had reached voting age and other Cameroonians had been disenfranchised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said relations between the Catholic Church and the government of President Paul Biya were cool. However, whenever the bishops had a point to make to the President - &quot;which was not often,&quot; they would make an appointment before going to see him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Multiparty democracy in Cameroon was forced on the government of President Paul Biya during the &quot;wind of change&quot; in much of West Africa in the early 90's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the presidential elections that confirmed the supremacy of the RDPC were widely accepted internationally as rigged or fraudulent and a number of international observers - including former US President Jimmy Carter's Carter Institute pulled out entirely in protest. Most international observers agreed that the opposition Social Democratic Front (SDF) of John Fru Ndi were cheated in the rigged poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But other observers blame a divided opposition for the constant rout they suffer at the hands of Paul Biya's RDPC, whose leader has been in power for the last 15 years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA (APS) - The Orthodox Church in Uganda has a new head, replacing the first Metropolitan of Kampala, the late Theodorus Nankyama who died of cancer last January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His Emminence Jonah Lwanga, 52, was enthroned the Orthodox Church Metropolitan of Kampala and All Uganda at St. Nicholas Cathedral, Namungoona, near here.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Metropolitan Lwanga was enthroned by His Beatitude the Pope and Patriarch of Alexandria and All Africa, Petros VII.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Metropolitan Lwanga, a Ugandan national was the founding bishop of the Orthodox Church Bukoba Diocese in Bukoba, north- western Tanzania. Before that Metropolitan Lwanga was for 10 years the Dean of Archbishop Makarios III Seminary in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new Metropolitan outlined his vision for the Orthodox Church in Uganda, pledging to reorganize and re-invigorate the church in the country. The church under his leadership will strengthen its social and health services sector, he promised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni was represented by the Prime Minister Mr. Kintu Musoke who used the opportunity to urge the churches to address the rising phenomenon of single parenthood.  &quot;The Metropolitan Lwanga is assuming the shepherdship of the church at a time when parental control of children is being eroded and single parenthood is becoming the norm,&quot; said the Premier, challenging the churches to tackle this social phenomenon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Orthodox Church in Uganda is a relatively small denomination with less than 50,000 members. It began as an indigenous split from the Uganda Anglicans, then Church Missionary Society (CMS) in 1929, but succeeded in regaining acceptance to the Greek Orthodox communion in 1946.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda's population of some 18 million people comprises about 70 per cent Christians belonging mainly to the Catholic and Anglican churches. The Muslims are about 2 million, while the rest belong to other religions including African traditionalists.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAPOURDIT-SOUTHERN SUDAN (APS) - The Comboni Missionaries have opened a secondary school at Mapourdit, about 1,300 kilometres south of the Sudanese capital Khartoum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The school which opened its doors to the first 23 students mid-May, will conduct a four-year course based on a curriculum similar to one offered in neighbouring Kenyan secondary schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current batch of students are all boys from the local Dinka community. &quot;It is not our intention to make it a boys-only institution but the circumstances surrounding the establishment of the first class were such that no girls could qualify for admission,&quot; said Monsignor Caesar Mazzolari, the Apostolic Administrator of Rumbek Diocese where the school is situated.  &quot;The subsequent classes, beginning next year, will all have girls,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also pointed out that the secondary school was not exclusively for the Dinka, but, being a non-boarding institution, it was only natural that it absorbed students from the local area which is inhabited by the Dinka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heading the secondary school is Fr. Michael Barton, a Comboni missionary from the USA, who has been instrumental in educational development in the region. In his line-up of teaching staff are fellow priests and sisters, as well as local qualified personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The learners,&quot; said Mgr Mazzolari, &quot;are very enthusiastic as they know that successful completion of their course will earn them a certificate with which they can land a job, or pursue further education.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mgr Mazzolari is equally impressed by the student population.  &quot;The population so far is quite encouraging considering that Sudan is currently at war and most of the youth have committed their energy and time to fighting for the cause of their people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan, Africa's most expansive state, has been at war since her independence in 1956, with only 11 years' hiatus from 1972- 83. Besides claiming not less than 1.3 million lives so far, the war has disrupted virtually every other aspect of life especially in the south. In some areas, for instance, formal education has ground to a halt for more than a decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consequently, Sudan is today among the world's poorest and least literate states. However, missionaries have been at the forefront in keeping the fire of enlightenment a glow by establishing a host of learning institutions for the Sudanese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The local community holds the Comboni school in high esteem as it is the first one of its kind in the area,&quot; says Mgr Mozzolari. Already in place at the school compound are two main blocks which house a classroom, laboratory, store, library and one large reading room. The buildings are made of sun-baked blocks with (thatch) grass roofs. Plans for future expansion have already been drawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from their educational institutions in Sudan, Comboni Missionaries also provide formal education to Sudanese refugees at the Kakuma refugee camp in northern Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August last year, they established the Josephine Bakhita Formation Centre (JBFC)for Sudanese in Kenya's Kitale town, about 407 kilometres north-west of Nairobi. The Centre aims to train young people from Sudan as agents of evangelization, education and development.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUJUMBURA (APS) - Fighting between Burundi's Tutsi-dominated army and Hutu rebels has intensified and was approaching Bujumbura amid reports of massacres of civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sound of heavy mortar fire echoed through the capital on May 27 as rebels and soldiers fought about 15 kilometres south- east of Bujumbura. Meanwhile, rumours swept the capital that the rebels were planning to attack it as panicked villagers fled to the capital's Musaga district, on the southern outskirts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gunfire was heard in Bujumbura's suburbs last week, and residents said then that rebels had infiltrated the city.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 19, police clashed here with students protesting government negotiations with Hutu rebels as the national radio reported that scores of people had been killed in rebel violence in the north-east.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radio Burundi had reported that 63 people were killed and 12 injured at two &quot;regroupment&quot; camps at Murwi and Buganda, in the north-eastern Cibitoke province, and blamed the rebels for the violence. It gave no further details of the attackers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The camps were officially set up to provide protection for civilians from such attacks. Some sources say they are aimed at depriving rebels of the support of Hutu civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tutsi-dominated army says Burundian Hutu rebels accused of the killings in Cibitoke are backed by members of the old Hutu Rwandan Armed Forces and Interahamwe militants, who are accused of carrying out the genocide of Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Army spokesman Isaie Nibizi said on May 12 that 18 Interahamwe and Hutu soldiers had been killed in Cibitoke as they were returning from Zaire to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, police struck students with truncheons and hauled a dozen of them into a military vehicle during the May 19 protest against talks with the Hutu National Council for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD), denounced as a &quot;genocidal&quot; movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major Pierre Buyoya, a member of the Tutsi minority who came to power in a coup on July 25 last year, disclosed last week that negotiations were being held in Rome between his representatives and the main rebel organization CNDD, led by former Interior Minister Leonard Nyangoma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the peace talks, Buyoya said, the Tutsi regime and the CNDD had agreed in principle to a ceasefire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rome talks followed a relaxation of an economic blockade against Burundi imposed by regional leaders days after Buyoya's rise to power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on May 22 Burundi Foreign Minister Luc Rukingama also said a conference would take place in Geneva in June under the aegis of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural organization (UNESCO) to which all political factions taking part in the Burundi conflict would be invited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All those taking part in the conflict will be invited, including (Burundi's) armed factions,&quot; Rukingama told reporters in Brussels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Foreign Minister said the conference could rapidly lead to peace negotiations, the dates of which had not been fixed but he said it could be June 14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Rukingama, the Geneva conference represents the &quot;second phase&quot; of the Rome talks. &quot;The government could sign a ceasefire as early as tonight. The problem is that the armed factions have not been as quick to respond,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rukingama said the Burundian leadership wanted the international community to put &quot;permanent pressure on the CNDD and the other armed factions in order to help the peace process&quot; and convince them to &quot;end the armed conflict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest intensified fighting followed a warning on May 26 by Burundi's former ruling party, the Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU) that guerrilla warfare would erupt if Burundi's military junta refuses to restore peace and constitutional rule in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter circulated to the Organization of African Unity (OAU) heads of state ahead of the June 2-4 summit in the Zimbabwean capital, Harare, FRODEBU president Jean Minani said &quot;as long as 'dictator' (major Pierre) Buyoya and his junta refuse this fundamental right to Burundian people, we will never get durable peace and stability in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If equitable solution is not achieved through the OAU and international community, FRODEBU party will use all means, including the military struggle, in order to bring its ideals to a successful conclusion,&quot; Minani's letter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comparing the Burundi situation to South Africa's former apartheid regime, Minani said that if the OAU and the international community had successfully destroyed racial policies and also solved serious conflicts in Mozambique and Namibia, &quot;there is no valid reason to fail in Burundi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hutu-dominated FRODEBU also appealed to the OAU and the UN to call on the security council to condemn and isolate Buyoya's Tutsi-led regime and to impose an arms embargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buyoya overthrew the Hutu president Sylvestre Ntibantunganya last July in a bloodless putsch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders of East Africa's Great Lakes region immediately condemned the coup and a total economic embargo was only eased last month as Buyoya embarked on mediated peace negotiations with all factions involved in the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Hutu guerrilla forces continue to battle the military regime. Civil war in the tiny Central African country has so far cost more than 150,000 lives, many of them peasants massacred by both sides.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FREETOWN (APS) - Sierra Leone's military leaders, who seized power in Sierra Leone on May 25 have indefinitely suspended the country's constitution and banned all demonstrations and meetings, as internal and international opposition grows against the new regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a radio broadcast late May 24, new military ruler Major Johnny Paul Koroma ordered the suspension of the country's 1991 constitution and banned all political parties &quot;until further notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As from now on, all legislation will be by military decrees,&quot; said Major Koroma, chairman of the ruling Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC), which ousted the elected regime of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, who fled to neighbouring Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We shall soon publish a timetable for a return to democracy after free and fair elections, but we don't want any democracy that is based on tribalism and regionalism,&quot; he said in a first policy address since the army seized power on May 25.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He accused the former civilian government of Kabbah of spending more money on local civil defence units than on the regular army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former government had been &quot;treating the welfare of the Kamajors (the local civil defence unit) more seriously than the army,&quot; he said, claiming that the deposed civilian government had spent between $200,000 and 250,000 on the Armed Forces every month, which was &quot;not reflected in the status of the ordinary soldier,&quot; while 'the Kamajors got $350,000 dollars which did not include logistics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major Koroma said the leader of the former rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) Corporal Foday Sankoh &quot;will soon return to take part in the nation's development,&quot; and that the new regime &quot;will soon put in place a broad-based government of national unity&quot; but without saying when.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Koroma was himself released on May 25 from jail, where he had been held on treason charges from an earlier coup attempt, and has since heightened concerns by releasing some 600 prisoners from jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, internal and international pressure was mounting against the 20 junior officers who led the coup, which has killed at least 100 people, amid widespread violence and looting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international community firmly rejected the uprising and demanded the reinstatement of the elected government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other condemnations, the 15-member UN Security Council &quot;strongly deplored this attempt to overthrow the democratically elected government, and called for an immediate restoration of constitutional order,&quot; while US State Department &quot;called on those claiming power in Freetown to return authority promptly to the country's elected leadership and parliament.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sierra Leone's United Nations envoy James Jonah told a news conference at the UN in New York on May 27 that he would, on behalf of President Kabbah, ask African leaders set to meet this week in Harare to impose sanctions to isolate the coup leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jonah also appealed to West African countries grouped under the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to act quickly to restore Kabbah's 14-month-old government, and said he had received pledges from ECOWAS chairman General Sani Abacha to restore the civilian government after a direct request from Kabbah, but did not know whether military force would be used by ECOWAS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have seen that delay in action leads to acceptance,&quot; said Jonah, referring to the July 1996 coup by Tutsi officers in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saying that he would demand a condemnation of the coup and also seek the imposition of travel sanctions against the coup leaders from the Organization of African Unity summit, Jonah declared: &quot;We are going to make it difficult for any military leader in the future to make a coup; therefore they will know that they will get no recognition, that they will not be allowed to travel freely within the sub-region of Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A naval Nigerian vessel carrying West African peacekeepers docked in Freetown on May 27 and another lay a short distance off the coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US helicopter-carrier, Kearsarge, would also be off Sierra Leone with 1,200 US Marines on board &quot;in the next couple of days,&quot; a Pentagon spokeswoman said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISTANBUL, TURKEY (APS) - Some 50 Orthodox women representing their various churches have come up with a list of recommendations concerning the role of women in the life of the Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recommendations deal, among other things, with theological education, the re-evaluation of some prayers and church practices, encouraging women's ministries, full participation of Orthodox women in the life of their church and the ecumenical movement, women's contribution to spiritual growth for all, the role of priests, wives, sexism and women's ordination, says a press release from the World Council of Churches (WCC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women were meeting here from May 10-17 under the theme Discerning the Signs of the Times: Women in the Life of the Orthodox Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting held within the context of the Ecumenical Decade of Churches in Solidarity with women, which will culminate at the World Council of Churches (WCC) Eighth Assembly in Harare, Zimbabwe in September 1998, was hosted by the Ecumenical Patriarch, Batholomew of Constantinople.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Istanbul forum was the third in a series for Orthodox women in connection with the Women's Decade. It was organised by Ms Aruna Gnanadason of the WCC Women's Desk and Orthodox theological consultant, Dr. Kyriaki Fitzgerald.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Up to now Orthodox women felt their concerns had not been taken seriously and did not feel part of the Decade. But now they see their work very much in terms of the Decade and they have come up with some very strong recommendations,&quot; Gnanadason said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the recommendations concerns theological education for women, which is seen as &quot;a priority&quot;. it should include education at the highest level and be open to all women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting also called for a re-evaluation of some church practices, particularly citing the tradition of mothers not going to church for 40 days after childbirth and &quot;certain prayers...for miscarriages, abortions and post-partum mothers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the women present said they felt &quot;these practices and prayers do not properly express the theology of the Church regarding the dignity of God's creation ofthe woman and her redemption in Christ.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women also called for new hymns to be written to reflect the lives of modern women martyrs and the sacrifices which Orthodox women continue to make.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sensitive subject of the ordination of women was also addressed in a carefully written recommendation: &quot;Some participants at the consultation welcome the idea that an inter- Orthodox conference on the ordination of women to the priesthood be organised, where women and men will have the opportunity to examine this topic in greater depth from both the theological and spiritual perspectives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a time when some within the Orthodox churches are questioning their involvement in the WCC, the Istanbul meeting recommended that the Orthodox Church appoint women delegates as representatives &quot;to the various aspects of the ecumenical movement, whether on the international, national or parish level.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women asked their churches &quot;to seriously consider&quot; complying with the WCC request that at least 50 per cent of their representatives at the Eighth Assembly be women, and to &quot;bestow their blessings&quot; on those women who will attend an Ecumenical Decade festival to be held in Harare just before the assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have never seen such a strong affirmation of a commitment to the ecumenical movement as came from these Orthodox women,&quot; Gnanadason was quoted saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Istanbul, conference members attended a worship service led by the Ecumenical Patriarch, who also opened the gathering.  Later, the patriarch wrote to the WCC General Secretary Rev. Dr.  Konard Raiser, that it had been &quot;a blessing and a joy&quot; to receive the participants. &quot;Their discussions were very valuable and will prove beneficial for our holy Orthodox Church,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants came from Egypt, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Georgia, Greece, Australia, lebanon, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Turkey,Syria, the United Kingdom and the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inaugurated in 1948, the World Council of Churches ia a fellowship of churches, now 331, in more than 100 countries in all continents from virtually all Christian traditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Roman Catholic Church is not a member it works cooperatively with the WCC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The highest governing body is the Assembly, which meets approximately every seven years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KITGUM-NORTHERN UGANDA (APS) - The wife of the Anglican Bishop of Kitgum Diocese, Northern Uganda died instantly on May 23 after the vehicle in which she was travelling hit a landmine on the Madi Opei road, seven kilometres north of here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs. Winfred Ochola, wife of Bishop Macleod Ochola died with four other people while seven other passengers on the pick-up sustained serious injuries and were rushed to local hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defence Ministry sources in Uganda say the mine was an anti- tank device planted by the rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) led by Joseph Kony who is reported to be in Sudan.  Apparently, the rebels had planted the device in the hope of hitting a military convoy they expected to pass on the road towards the Uganda-Sudan border where both countries have reinforced their border patrols.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda accused Sudan of helping the LRA, including providing them with anti-personnel and tank mines. Sudan on its part charges Uganda is the back-bone of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) of John Garang who have won substantial territory in recent fighting in Southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Church of Uganda (Anglican) Archbishop Livingstone Mpalanyi Nkoyoyo was among hundreds and hundreds of mourners who attended Mrs Ochola's burial on May 25 at the All Saints Cathedral cemetery. In his message of condolence to the family, he appealed to the government to try and minimise the suffering of the people of Northern Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Martin Aliker, State Minister for Foreign Affairs described Mrs Ochola as a kind and hard working mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year, during a conference in London that was organised by the Acholi people of northern Uganda to discuss the insurgency in the region, Bishop Ochola, a member of the Acholi ethnic group, bitterly criticised the leaders of the LRA based in Nairobi, Kenya - who attended the conference in London - saying, the rebel army had caused untold suffering to innocent civilians in the region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ABUJA (APS) - West African leaders have given some much-needed breathing space to politicians and election officials in war-torn Liberia, following their decision on May 21 to postpone crucial elections originally scheduled for May 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The polls, the first presidential and parliamentary in Liberia in more than a decade, will now be held on July 9, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most Liberian politicians and religious leaders had complained that the initial date posed logistical and security problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at their summit here on May 21, Heads of State of the 16- nation Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) adopted an earlier recommendation by the ECOWAS Foreign Ministers' meeting to postpone the summit to give Liberians a new lease of hope for political parties and the country in general.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ECOWAS summit also fixed August 2 as the date for inaugurating a new government in Liberia, but if a second round of voting became necessary, this could be held on August 2 and the government sworn in on August 16, an official statement issued on May 22 at the end of the summit said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit also approved an election budget of $5.4 million.  The elections will be the last step in the Liberian peace process under a plan hammered out in August 1995 after previous agreements failed to be implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revised Abuja accord a year later by an ECOWAS summit here followed more than a dozen failed initiatives to resolve the conflict, which destroyed almost all of Liberia's infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under its terms, Liberia's main warlords agreed that all factions would be dissolved by January 31, four months ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections. The combatants were finally disarmed and their factions disbanded early this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia's civil war, ignited in December 1989 by Charles Taylor's National patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), the country's largest militia, resulted in the death of between 150,000 and 200,000 people by the end of 1995, according to United Nations estimates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers here believe that the new outcome of the summit, attended by the Heads of State of Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Niger and Nigeria, has &quot;gone along way in redeeming the alleged partisan image of some ECOWAS countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also attending were Ruth Perry, chairperson of Liberia's Ruling Council of State, Togo's Prime Minister and ministers from Gambia, Senegal and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 21, President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana denied suggestions that his country and Nigeria were supporting presidential candidates and former warlord Charles Taylor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor, whose National Patriotic Party (NPP) is better resourced and organised than its 15 rivals, had repeatedly called for the elections to be held on May 30 as initially scheduled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Rawlings stressed: &quot;We have no interest in supporting any political party and we have done anything possible to demonstrate our neutrality in Liberia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor, for his part, reacted positively to the postponement, telling journalists &quot;I am pleased with the outcome of the meeting. We are satisfied with the date and we are ready to cooperate with ECOWAS to ensure the success of the election,&quot; although a Nigerian diplomat pointed out that Taylor had no other choice after ECOWAS leaders made it clear to him that the future of Liberia was more important to them than his personal ambitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ECOWAS decision has been fair to all 16 Liberian political parties as well as giving more credibility to the entire (Abuja) peace plan in front of the international community,&quot; the diplomat added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before now, it was as if everything was going on directly in favour of Taylor,&quot; said one Liberian journalist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two former faction leaders, Taylor and Alhaji Kromah, as well as Liberia's former Finance Minister Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf -- the only woman contesting the crucial polls -- will be among leaders of 16 political parties vying for the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson-Sirleaf, a Harvard University graduate, who resigned as assistant administrator and regional director for Africa at the UN Development Programme (UNDP) to stand in the elections, declared at a press conference in the Liberian capital on May 26 that her qualifications, honesty, experience and numerous contacts made her the best choice of the Liberian people at this time.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALGIERS (APS) - Algerian security forces have killed some 137 Islamic extremists in several anti-terrorist offensives only days ahead of legislative elections scheduled for June 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The El Khabar reported on May 27 that some 120 guerrillas had died near Ouarsenis, 250 kilometres south-west of Algiers, in one of the biggest operations by security forces since civil war began in this North African country early 1992. A further 14 extremists were killed in Tlemcen district, 540 kilometres west of the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ouarsenis offensive centres on a zone that forms the headquarters of Ahmed Benaicha, number two in the Islamic Salvation Army (AIS), the armed wing of the banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 200 of his men are in the region, and a price of 4.5 million dinars ($90,000) has been put on Benaicha's head, according to posters displayed in recent days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Algerian authorities are offering the reward to anyone who helps them find the leaders of three powerful armed Islamic groups, among them Anta Zouabri, 27, head of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA). That price is 1,1000 times higher than the monthly minimum wage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While FIS leaders in exile have called for an election boycott, one of the masterminds of its 1991 showing at the ballot box began a hunger strike in his Algiers prison cell, his lawyers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abdelkader Hanchani, 42, is protesting his &quot;arbitrary detention&quot; and the government's refusal to try him in court, the lawyers said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was arrested on January 23, 1992 and accused of having called for disobedience in the armed forces, through a communique published as an advertisement in the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The operation, which El Khabar said was begun on the basis of information from two informers, has not been officially confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Algerian press also reported that the death toll from three car-bomb attacks over the past two days had gone up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the death toll from a car-bomb attack on May 22 in Boufarik rose to 20, with hundreds of people injured, the daily Le Matin reported, citing security sources. An official toll earlier said 12 people were killed and 31 injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The press also reported that two car-bomb attacks in Tlemcen, 400 kilometers from Algiers, had claimed between nine and 18 lives. The official toll said seven people were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The June 5 elections will be the first for the People's National Assembly in five years, after the military annulled a December 1991 vote that the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That move had ignited a ruthless war with Islamic extremists, including gruesome village massacres and car-bomb attacks, which have left more than 60,000 dead, according to Western estimates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through a commentary on its official Algerian Press Service news agency, President Liamine Zeroual's government insisted on May 23 that it would never allow &quot;blood-thirty criminals&quot; to foil the June 5 polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Picking up on that note, the National Democratic Rally (RND), founded in April by core supporters of the president, warned on May 24 of a fresh 'drift towards Islam.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its spokesman Hamraoui Habib-Chawki, at a press conference, urged Algerians to show &quot;vigilance&quot; and &quot;maturity&quot; to avert a repeat of the FIS near-victory more than five years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Islam was being exploited for partisan ends, he said, singling out the Movement of Society for Peace (MSP), led by Cheikh Mahfoud Nahnah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Beware of those who promise paradise Those who did in 1991 were offering hell to the people,&quot; Habib-Chawki said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Nahnah hit back on May 26 by threatening not to take part in the election, saying: &quot;We refuse to be a tool of a false democracy and to take part in a process that does not really reflect the will of the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Known as Hamas before it changed names to conform with Algeria's no-Islam electoral laws, the MSP was expected, with the RND, to lead the field in the vote to be held in four days' time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nahnah, a moderate Islamist regarded as one of the pioneers of Islamic politics in Algeria, himself took 25 per cent of the vote in the last presidential election, second to Zeroual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the MSP has switched its motto from &quot;Islam is the solution&quot; to &quot;Peace is the solution,&quot; some RND officials have alleged that its success at the polls could trigger a new Islamist wave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Algerian newspapers hostile to Islamists have repeatedly claimed that Nahnah is not as moderate as he claims to be, but rather a political opportunist who switches his colours as circumstances dictate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Nigerian foreign minister Tom Ikimi said on Tuesday in Harare his country is trying to restore order in Sierra Leone whose government was ousted in a military coup last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ikimi told Ziana that his country had sent its forces to help Sierra Leone in pursuit of the common goal of trying to bring peace and stability to the West African region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not interference,&quot; he said. &quot;We, as Ecowas (the Economic Community of West African States), have always been interested in explosive situations that take place in our region which we see as endangering civilian lives and disturb peace.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Together with the international community we must not allow such a situation to continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nigeria is going to ensure that peace, stability and a legitimate government are restored in Sierra Leone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sierra Leone President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah was ousted from power by rebels led by Major Johnny Koromah on Africa Day (May 25).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports from the capital, Freetown, said the rebels, who had taken some people hostage, were trying to use them as a bargaining chip to further their interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 12 people were reported to have died during the Nigerian offensive launched on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations and the OAU have condemned the coup and demanded that rebel leaders should restore the ousted government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ikimi is representing the Nigerian head of state, Gen. Sani Abacha, at the 33rd Summit of heads of state and government of the Organisation of African Unity, which entered its second day here on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Zimbabwe's human rights watchdog, Zimrights, on Tuesday served Organisation of African Unity (OAU) Secretary General, Salim Ahmed Salim, with an open letter protesting the intervention by Nigerian-led forces to reverse a May 25 coup in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the letter, also circulated to the press and delegates at the 33rd OAU summit in Harare, Zimrights said: &quot;As a human rights organisation, we would like to register our categorical protest at the intervention by Nigerian-led forces to reverse an eight-day old coup by Sierra Leonian troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zimrights believes that the current intervention by Nigerian-led troops in Sierra Leone is an attempt by some quarters within the oau to cleanse Nigeria's military of the late Ken Saro-wiwa's blood and, at the same time, exonerate the regime from its pariah status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It goes without saying that the OAU has become an ideological toy of Nigeria because of its religio-economic influence in the sub-region and huge oil resources,&quot; said the letter, signed by Zimrights executive director, David Chimhini.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There had been a &quot;litany&quot; of coups in Nigeria but the OAU had, in each case, &quot;dogmatically&quot; stuck to the provision of non-interference in the internal affairs of a member state,&quot; said Zimrights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zimrights disapproves of 'big brother' politics which tramples on the rights and freedoms of minorities.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - President Laurent Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo says his immediate task, as the country's new leader, is to boost development in the Central African state using local resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila told the Zimbabwe Inter-African News Agency (ZIANA) that most of the developmental programmes would largely be financed through internal resources with little external aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though faced with a mammoth task of rebuilding a country where there has been no meaningful development for 32 years, under the dictatorship of Mobutu Sese Seko, Kabila said he was confident of meeting the challenges before him head on.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Corruption is rampant, there are many jobless people, agriculture is poor, there are so many priorities,&quot; he said of the former state of Zaire which is saddled with a 14 billion external debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;External aid is important but first we must count on our own capabilities. We have potential in human resources and wealth,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila, who declared himself president when he took power May 17, was sworn in Thursday last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is in Harare attending the 33rd Organization of African Unity (OAU) summit of heads of state and government which ends Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the lives of 40 million people in his hands, Kabila, 56, said he was determined to exploit the potential wealth of his country and improve standards of living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila and his rebel army took up arms in October 1996, in protest over Zairean nationality for ethnic Tutsis, the Banyamulenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu's government was linked with corruption and widespread abuse of human rights during most of his 32-year reign. He amassed personal fortune estimated in the billions of dollars at the peril of Africa's potentially richest nation with a wealth of minerals and rich farmland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The most important thing is we have liberated our country,&quot; Kabila said. &quot;Even those who supported Mobutu say they support us now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked what his feeling was towards most of Africa's leaders who never chided Mobutu over his excesses, he said: &quot;You cannot choose your neighbors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila said the two-year period before the elections would be used to ensure some basic infrastructure and support services INL002 from SSS.115 (970603-18:01) QN PANAINL .PANADKR MSG114G/02E</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) would be in place to facilitate the transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If everything goes according to plan,&quot; he said, &quot;two years is enough for us to prepare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for his record on democracy, which has already been criticized after he banned political activities and public demonstrations last week, Kabila said the people of Africa would &quot;judge&quot; him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - African leaders met Tuesday for their inaugural session of the African Economic Community which is geared to become a force in ridding the continent of its poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, who assumed the chairmanship of the 53-member Organization of African Unity at its 33rd summit in Harare, said the establishment of the highest organ of the community constituted a standard by which Africa's future economic policies would be judged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event was witnessed by 28 heads of state and government and three prime ministers. Mugabe said the occasion crowned efforts stretching several decades made by the O.A.U., resulting in several resolutions and declarations which laid a firm political foundation for the establishment of the community.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe, speaking on the second day of the summit, emphasized that the pillars of the community were the African regional integration bodies specified in the Abuja Treaty adopted June 1991, which came into force in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe said the entry into force of the Abuja Treaty, establishing the AEC, vindicated the vision and commitment of successive generations of African leaders who believed that the continent could never be independent unless it took responsibility for its economic and political destiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What African countries are now required to do, Mugabe said, was to integrate their markets and transform their economies currently characterized by low levels of industrialization, high dependence on international trade, extremely low levels of intra-African trade and small markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The community, he said, should make it possible for African countries to produce competitive products that would enjoy preferential treatment in African markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that Africa faced a hostile external economic environment induced by forces outside its control. For example, he said African countries continued to be exporters of raw materials and minerals whose prices they did not control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the years, he added, the value of exports had been declining and yet the cost of importing manufactured products had been on the increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa and the entire developing world, he said, were subjected to hostile policies by the World Trade Organization and international financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would appear that there is a coordinated political agenda by the north, which controls these institutions, aimed at suppressing the development of developing countries,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Africa must build bridges of solidarity with other affected countries in the ACP, group of 77 and the non-aligned movement,&quot; Mubage said. &quot;Together we must resist the recolonization of our countries under a facade of programmes to safeguard the global environment or globalization.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through the inaugural session of the AEC, he said, the continent had sent a strong signal that it was now empowering itself to defeat the indignities of poverty, hunger and disease through targeted joint actions in social, economic and political spheres.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cornerstone for the factory, with the capacity to produce 2,000 tons of cement per day, was laid Monday in the Tigray regional capital by Seye Abraha, a senior state official, in the presence of Turkish ambassador to Ethiopia, Murat Belhan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ethiopian News Agency reported that the factory, which will be operational in February 1999, will provide jobs for 500 people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO (DROC) - Background</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In mid-October 1996, fighting broke out in South Kivu, Zaire between the Zairian army (FAZ) and the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire, led by Laurent Kabila. The fighting caused Rwandan and Burundian refugees to flee, prompting more than 700,000 Rwandans and 62,000 Burundians to repatriate by the end of 1996. Hundreds of thousands of refugees also fled west, scattering in small groups in Zaire. The fighting spread, with the Alliance rapidly gaining territory on all fronts, and ended when the Alliance seized Kinshasa on May 17. Kabila Consolidates Power Amid Protests In Kinshasa, Kabila named himself president of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DROC), formerly Zaire, and on May 22 he announced a cabinet without appointing a prime minister. On May 29, Kabila was formally inaugerated as head of state.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila banned anti-government political activities, including demonstrations, after public protests flared in the capital on May 23. Despite the ban, 800 to 1,000 supporters of opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi staged a march.  Government troops initially allowed the marchers to proceed before dispersing them with shots in the air and beatings. In Goma, about 1,000 university students also staged a protest on May 30. They dispersed after five truckloads of DROC troops arrived and fired in the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few Refugees in Kisangani-Ubundu Corridor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Kisangani reported that as of May 30, a total of 37,221 refugees had been repatriated through Kisangani. Of the total, 3,756 were unaccompanied children (UAC), of whom 26 died during the repatriation operation, and 46 were reunited with their parents or guardians before reaching Rwanda. As of May 27, there were 253 UACs remaining in the Kisangani transit center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along the corridor, 13 refugees emerged from the forest surrounding Biaro (km 41) on March 28. The World Food Program (WFP) and CARE, supported by USAID, are providing hot food at Biaro for the refugees. A WFP train took food and non-food items to Obilo (km 82) on May 28, and brought back 837 refugees, including 84 UACs, to Kisangani for repatriation.  Another 2,000 refugees remain at Obilo. Ubundu (km 125) was empty of refugees as of May 27. In late April, the UNHCR estimated that 91,000 refugees had gathered along the corridor. Only half are accounted for to date, and the numbers of refugees emerging from the forest during the past weeks have shrunk from several hundred to fewer than one hundred at a time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Road Access Remains Difficult</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On May 27, UNHCR/Kisangani officials were granted permission to travel by road to km 53, where the road ends.  However, they turned back at km 50 after finding a DROC military vehicle that had struck an anti-tank mine. DROC authorities promised to clear the road of mines and the UNHCR has asked that a DROC military vehicle lead the rescheduled mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundian Refugees Not to Be Repatriated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are 249 Burundian refugees registered in the Kisangani transit center. The UNHCR and local Kisangani authorities have agreed not to repatriate them and their seven compatriots in Mbandaka, because of insecurity in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More Refugees Estimated in Mbandaka On May 23 and 24 a USAID/DART field officer visited Mbandaka, 600 km west of Kisangani, as part of a U.N./NGO team focussed on establishing and improving emergency operations at the airport transit site. The UNHCR estimated that, as of May 26, there were 18,400 Rwandan refugees in the area: 2,900 at the transit site and 15,500 hiding in forests. Those in the camps are primarily males in relatively good condition, and most had made their way to Mbandaka from the Bukavu, Goma, Opala, and Ikela areas.  Of the 15,500, the UNHCR believes 7,500 are clustered along the southwestern axis, parallel to the Congo River. Another 2,000 refugees are reportedly in Djombo, 7 km south of Mbandaka; and 1,000 refugees are believed to be along the southeastern axis in Bamayana, 12 km southeast of Mbandaka. An additional 5,000 refugees are further south along the Congo River in Irebu, which reportedly is not yet in DROC control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief Efforts Underway in Mbandaka</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medecins Sans Frontieres/Belgium (MSF/B), which has implemented health services in the Mbandaka region for the past five years, was the first NGO to provide assistance at the transit site. Their workers established three medical units which provide triage and consultative services, as well as basic drugs and medical services, primarily to treat malaria. Because DROC officials do not allow MSF/B expatriates to stay in Mbandaka, the NGO maintains a cadre of two local doctors and three nurses in the town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MSF/B also has established a water distribution system at the transit site that provides 5,000 liters per day of potable water, enough for 4,000 people. Refugees received maize meal during their first week at the transit site. They supplemented the ration by trading part of it on the local market for fruit, fish, and beans. Since May 23, the refugees have received a daily distribution of UNIMIX, a high-protein porridge, and high-protein biscuits. On May 26, WFP was scheduled to deliver to Mbandaka enough food for 4,000 people for two weeks. Wet feeding kitchens, aimed at vulnerable groups among the refugees, have been established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UACs Receive Special Attention</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNICEF provides general management and coordination of activities targeting UACs at the transit site. Save the Children (SCF) identifies and registers UACs, and the local Red Cross provides food, water, and medical assistance. Most of the UACs at the transit site are teenage boys, in contrast to the mix of young boys and girls who make up the typical UAC profile. UNICEF has established mobile teams to collect UACs directly from villages and transport them to the transit site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Repatriation Operation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between May 21 and 29, the UNHCR reported that 4,700 refugees were repatriated by air from Mbandaka to Kigali.  Repatriation flights are now carrying up to 900 refugees daily from the transit site. There are three Ilyushin-76 aircraft, one donated by the World Food Program (WFP), transporting the refugees to Kisangani. Each aircraft can carry 300 per trip.  The UNHCR intends to transport as many refugees as possible from the surrounding area to the transit site before it airlifts them to Kigali. It estimates that repatriation will last about one month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR has established collection points at six villages in the Mbandaka region. The collection points are used to encourage refugees to emerge from the forest, to collect information from the local villagers on the number and location of the refugees, and to serve as a meeting place for refugees awaiting transportation to the transit site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR has also established mobile teams that travel in UNHCR-escorted trucks to gather the refugees at each Mbandaka collection point. To date, about 700 refugees are being transport daily from the collection points to the airport transit site. Insecurity prevents mobile teams from searching the nearby forests for refugees, and there are unconfirmed reports that 140 refugees were killed by Alliance forces on May 13 in Wenji, 20 km southwest of Mbandaka. To gain local goodwill and keep people informed of the repatriation operation, the UNHCR plans this week to distribute eight shortwave radios to village chiefs in the Mbandaka region. So far, relations between the refugees and local villagers have been friendly, despite reported incidents of refugees stealing livestock and raiding crops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local Support; ICRC Assistance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR hopes to limit the number of NGOs supporting the Mbandaka operation. Where possible, the UNHCR and relief agencies will use local resources. The DROC Red Cross workers have been hired to conduct daily food distributions, and to work with MSF/B in coordination with UNICEF. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) will provide guidance and management to the local Red Cross. The ICRC is paying salaries of local Red Cross workers assisting UNICEF with UAC care, and is providing logistical support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees in the ROC and CAR On May 28, UNICEF reported the presence of about 15,000 Rwandan refugees who crossed into the Republic of Congo (ROC). Of the total, about 7,500 are in Liranga, 500 km north of Brazzaville; 4,000 are in Loukolela, 80 km south of Liranga; 500-600 are in Makotopoko, 250 km north of Brazzaville, and 500 in Mpouya, 175 km north of Brazzaville. UNICEF also reports there are other small groups of refugees who have not been identified. The U.N. plans to move refugees by barge to Kintele, 30 km from Brazzaville and a three-day river journey from Liranga. When the refugees reach Kintele, they will be screened, and the armed elements among them will be separated. The refugees will then be moved to a temporary site at Bilolo, 18 km from Brazzaville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A UNHCR team has confirmed that about 4,500 refugees are gathered in the towns of Mobaye and Kemba, on the Central African Republic (CAR) side of the Ubangi River. The refugees are mostly officials of the former Mobutu government, but the group also includes about 300 Rwandans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Return Operation for Uvira Delayed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of May 25, the ICRC transported 5,500 internally displaced persons (IDP) from Kisangani to Bukavu, Goma, Isiro, Bunia, and Walikale. This includes 100 IDPs who were transported between May 18- 25. Of the 100 IDPs, the ICRC trucked 47 to Walikale and flew the remainder to Goma and Bukavu. The ICRC plans to move another 900 IDPs from Kisangani to their homes in eastern Zaire. Most will travel overland to Lubutu and Walikale by truck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICRC had planned to begin returning 6,000- 7,000 IDPs from Kalemie to Uvira by barge on May 29. It postponed the return because of insecurity that followed the shooting of five locals in Uvira on May 25. The local population blamed DROC soldiers for the killings and held a demonstration the next day. A riot ensued, and at least 10 people were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RWANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11 Die in Kibuye Ambush</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police commander of the Kibuye region and ten other people died when a minibus and another vehicle were ambushed on May 26, according to a news report that quoted military sources. The attack, carried out by about 30 armed men, occurred between Kivumu and Mabanza communes in Kibuye prefecture, western Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attackers were believed to be members of the former Rwandan army (ex-FAR) and militia (Interahamwe).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three Men Sentenced on Genocide Charges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan radio reported on May 22 that three men were sentenced to death in a Kibuye court on charges of genocide in 1994. Two other courts sentenced two men to life imprisonment, and another to three years imprisonment; a fourth was acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BURUNDI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Widespread Violence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR reported that 60 people, mostly returnees, were killed on May 19 in an attack on three sites where returnees had settled at Ndava, Cibitoke province. Three days later, another attack killed one person and wounded five. An independent Burundian radio station reported the deaths of 42 people during an attack on a church in Muhuta, 31 km south of the capital, on May 14. A Burundian army spokesman said he had no information on the attack. Fighting also continues in the south, and in Bujumbura Rural province, mortar fire in the countryside can be heard in the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Arusha, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda adjourned until September 29 the trial of Jean-Paul Akayesu.  He is charged with involvement in the massacre of 2,000 Tutsis during the 1994 genocide. Akayesu's lawyer said he had been unable to find witnesses to testify. On May 29, the trial of Georges Rutaganda, a high-ranking member of the Interahamwe militia, was adjourned until June 9.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - &quot;The Media of the powerless,&quot; ANC Media Statement to mark the last Edition of the New Nation, 30 May 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a television debate in 1968, Bertrand Russell had occasion to draw a sharp distinction between an open mind and an empty mind. He illustrated the difference by employing the analogy of a juror, who though he/she holds an opinion regarding crime, will not give judgement in a case until he/she has heard all the relevant facts. Such a person, Russell said, has an open mind.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalists, columnists, newspaper editors and consequently the newspapers they produce, like the rest of us, hold opinions. It would be childish to pretend that these prior opinions do not intrude on their work or colour their perceptions. We can but hope that, like Russell's juror, they will only pass judgement after all the relevant facts are known. In other words, we hope they have open minds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people of South Africa, who like their counterparts in other industrial societies, rely on a free and independent media for most of their information about the world around them, have all too often been bitterly disappointed by its performance. This was particularly true during the darkest days of National Party repression between 1961 and 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The untimely disappearance of the New Nation from the South African media landscape marks the tragic end of an heroic career in this country's communications industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Nation was among a fraternity of courageous newspapers and journals that came into existence in the course of the hard fought struggles of the mid - 1980s, in order to fill the yawning gap in news, information and opinions occasioned by the supine attitude of the White-owned commercial press towards the National Party's oppressive regime. These publications came to be known as the alternative press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Operating on shoe string budgets and sustained by donor funds from abroad, the alternative media continuously tested the outer limits of the apartheid regimes prescriptive laws to give voice to the powerless million in the urban townships, the rural areas and those engaged in the struggle for democracy. Because most of them were weeklies, they specialised in in-depth analysis and investigative journalism bringing to light some of the worst atrocities perpetrated by the National Party governments security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Nation was established by the Catholic Bishops Conference and staffed by some of South Africa's most daring black journalists, led by Zwelakhe Sisulu. The paper quickly carved out a niche as an authoritative voice among the anti- apartheid forces coalesced in the Mass Democratic Movement.  Under the able stewardship of Zwelakhe Sisulu it came to be regarded as the flagship of democratic media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decade during which the New Nation was born marked the decisive turning point in th post-war history of our country, when the initiative passed from the hands of the oppressive regime to the national democratic movement. The historians of the future will record and assess the contribution the New Nation made to this turn of events. Even at this early date we are however able to comment that while many other newspapers wavered and prevaricated, the New Nation stood firm; where many other editors and journalists compromised their principals, those at the New Nation refused to be cowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It beggars the term &quot;temerity&quot; that one such newspaper patronisingly refers to the New Nation as more of a &quot;propaganda organ&quot; than a newspaper when we recall how that very newspaper shamelessly cheered the murderous death squads of the NP that tried to assassinate Albie Sachs, now a Constitutional Court judge!!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revelations before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission vindicate the New Nation's coverage virtually everyday, while the cheer leaders for murders of Vlakplaas desperately pray for our collective amnesia rather than admit their culpability!!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because they remained undaunted, the editor and the journalists at the New Nation received the unwelcome attentions of the NP's secret police. Zwelakhe Sisulu was regularly detained and his newspaper was periodically banned.  As one of the principal standard bearers of media freedom in this country at a time when such advocacy carried a high price, the New Nation and the courageous men and women who worked on it, can take pride in our Bill of Rights that entrenches the freedoms they sacrificed to attain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a heartening instance of poetic justice, the last issue of the New Nation comes off the press at a time when their chief political tormentors, the National Party, are plunging deeper and deeper into political crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Long after the pages of its last edition have been yellowed by age, the people of South Africa, especially the millions who engaged in struggle, will remember the New Nation for its sterling service to our country and the cause of freedom. That is a track record any newspaper can be proud of.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The growing number of resignations at the SABC and the resultant decline in standards and quality of TV news, compel the National Party to call the minister in question, Jay Naidoo, to account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Party once again demands that the stipulation in the Constitution, which makes provision for institutions receiving government funds to be subjected to performance audits by the Auditor-General, be applied to the SABC by the minister with immediate effect. All is not well - regardless of what the SABC spokesman, Mr Enoch Sithole, holds out to the world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SABC, currently battling with unknown financial problems, as well as the number of resignations of top management, will have to urgently reconsider its role as public broadcaster. Foreign consultants who are being appointed at great cost to advise the SABC, do not necessarily have the expertise and experience to give the kind of advice required within the South African context. In addition, the SABC can no longer afford to appoint to management positions people who may lack expertise in the field of broadcasting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The time has arrived for Minister Jay Naidoo to act responsibly in order to ensure that the SABC does not collapse due to the lack of managerial expertise. Government can no longer afford to carry the SABC financially merely because the SABC is the public broadcaster. For the SABC to broadcast to all and sundry that all is well, is, to say the least, extremely disquieting. Does the SABC accept that its situation is normal, or is the SABC in such a state of deterioration that it can no longer discern the difference between normality and calamity? Does the SABC really need more consultants to confirm that its voice is faltering?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Statement by Adriaan Blaas, MP, Member of the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee On Labour, COSATU Action on 2 June 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The action by COSATU on 2 June 1997 and the threats arising from this are economically irresponsible and insensitive towards the interests of the poorest people of South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COSATU abuses the exclusive powerbase which it is granted by law, to blackmail organised business to its own advantage.  This is evidence of a disregard of the government's Gear plan and is extremely irresponsible towards the economic objectives set for South Africa. COSATU will have to realise that South Africa will first have to work harder before it can think of self-enrichment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COSATU is an &quot;elite&quot; minority group that does not include the 40% poorest people in South Africa. Its action is detrimental to the possibility of creating jobs for the unemployed. It is a selfish and irresponsible deed that is rejected by the National Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it does not want to make a voluntary commitment, COSATU will have to be forced to use its powers and power base in a responsible manner in the interests of South Africa and all its people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Text of questions and answers on Sierra Leone by State Department Acting Spokesman John Dinger at the Department's daily briefing June 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Do you have any idea what is going on in Sierra Leone?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: Let me go through, I think, what I have, and then you can ask any further questions if you have them. The United States carried out two evacuations from Freetown on Friday and Sunday. We took out approximately 1,300 people, including approximately 400 Americans. The remaining 900 nationals were from over 40 different countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of the evacuees who had been taken to the Kearsarge were later taken on to Conakry, Guinea. About half of those evacuees left Conakry on a charter flight to Brussels on Sunday. A second charter is scheduled to depart Conakry today.  Additionally, there was a British charter flight which also left Conakry on Sunday, and that carried approximately 30 Americans. That flight was to London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We now have reports of somewhere between 12 and 30 American citizens still in Freetown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Are they there voluntarily?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: We believe that those Americans want to leave Sierra Leone. It is difficult to speculate on why they were not at the departure point for the first two evacuation flights, but that is beside the point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We understand that what is happening now - the Kearsarge will remain in the area pending a determination of whether another evacuation from Freetown is possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our ambassador to Sierra Leone, John Hirsch, returned to the region over the weekend and arrived on board the Kearsarge on Saturday. He is now there with Anne Wright who was the charge, now, the DCM. The two of them, particularly Ambassador Hirsch and the commander of the forces there, will make a judgment call on whether and when further evacuations can take place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We understand that there are perhaps some 200 - it's very difficult to know how many, but perhaps 200 foreigners in the Mammy Yoko Hotel, which was the evacuation site. We also understand that there has been fighting near the hotel. It is very difficult to know specifically what is going on, of course, because communications are very difficult between Freetown and Washington or the Kearsarge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, we understand that most of those foreigners are now in the basement of the Mammy Yoko Hotel. We also understand that there are some small fires in the Mammy Yoko Hotel; however, it is very difficult to know with any certainty the origin of the fires or the extent of the fires.  However, the last word that we have is that the fires were relatively small and did not pose any immediate imminent direct threat to the people who have taken shelter in the basement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States, of course, does not have a protecting power in Sierra Leone. We issued a new travel warning over the weekend warning, first of all, all Americans to defer travel to Sierra Leone; also again urging Americans who continue to remain in Sierra Leone to leave immediately. We ask everyone to be aware that there are no U.S. Government officials in Sierra Leone to assist them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, we are in close contact with the British High Commission which is still somewhat staffed in Sierra Leone. We are cooperating closely with them on security, evacuation and political issues. We understand that the British High Commission is in touch with most, if not all of the factions in Freetown, including the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also understand that there have been discussions over the last 24 hours between the Nigerian commander of the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group forces in Sierra Leone and the Armed Forces Revolutionary Counsel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also understand that the International Committee of the Red Cross is very active in Sierra Leone, and is discussing and perhaps has even established a very fragile cease-fire with the AFRC rebels. However, there is fighting. Reportedly there has been some shelling this morning between Nigerian forces, which are securing the Mammy Yoko Hotel and other locations, and the other fighters in Freetown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, on Sunday the AFRC was expanded to 26 persons.  That incorporated members of previous rebels during the civil war in Sierra Leone. The RUF leader, Foday Sankoh, was named vice chairman of the council. However, he remains under house arrest in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the United States is using all diplomatic channels available to urge the rebels to quit and restore the democratically elected government of Sierra Leone. We are also supporting, to the extent we can, the fragile cease-fire between ECOMOG and rebel forces in an effort to stabilize the situation and allow, as possible, a third evacuation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We understand as of this morning that the Nigerian forces appear to be in a defensive posture near the installations and buildings that they have been securing against attacks by the rebels. To the best of our knowledge there are currently approximately 2,000 Nigerian troops in Sierra Leone. I think that's about all I have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: On the statement that the Nigerians appear to be in a defensive position. Our reports say that their gunboats are shelling what appears to be the rebel headquarters. Do you know if that is true?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: I can't confirm that. We obviously are aware of reports that there was at least artillery fire from the Nigerian forces this morning. We are aware of those reports, but in the midst of the chaos in Freetown, we cannot verify any of those reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Do you find that the Nigerian troops are playing a useful role stabilizing the situation?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: The Nigerians have said that is their role. I would point out that my understanding is that the Nigerians have been in the vicinity of the Mammy Yoko Hotel, and they have been acting to try to defend the hotel against rebels.  Certainly, if the Nigerians are protecting Americans and other foreigners in the Mammy Yoko Hotel, we would certainly be grateful for that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: John, there were also reports just before coming in here that the Mammy Yoko Hotel was under fire. The accounts by the Nigerian forces that apparently spoke to the wire services indicated that it was a very severe battle. How is it - is the United States or is Ambassador Hirsch in touch with the British High Commission to determine the fate of the foreigners who are at the hotel? Or does he have direct links to the hotel?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: I'm not aware of any direct links between the Kearsarge and the hotel. My understanding is that there are two main means of communication. One is from the hotel to the United States or elsewhere. I understand much of the communication has been with the manager of the hotel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, as you have mentioned, I think, the British High Commission remains active there, and we are in touch, as possible, with the British High Commission. So the assessment is generally being made through those communication links, and of course to the extent possible, any observations that can be made from the Kearsarge or any of its assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: There is the hope here, then, that a cease-fire is established and then a determination made by the commander and the ambassador as to whether or not an evacuation is possible?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: We understand that there is, to some degree, a fragile cease-fire in place. I cannot confirm that there is heavy fighting at the moment near the Mammy Yoko Hotel. I understand there has been fighting. I just can't confirm either the extent of it, or whether it goes on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What will happen now in terms of a third evacuation is a judgment call by the people nearest the events, that is the commander on the Kearsarge of the Marines, and our Ambassador onboard. That is a judgment call - cost-risk evaluation - to decide when or if a third evacuation should take place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Do you have any idea who these Americans are?  They are not officials, I assume.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: I can't tell you who they are, although I did just receive a call that some are journalists. Beyond that, I can't narrow it down for you. We can't even know with any certainty what the numbers are. Our numbers for Americans is between 12 and 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: But you assume that they're not in any way connected with the embassy? That's what I was saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: There are no official Americans still in Freetown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: John, do you know where they are in town?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: Pardon me?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Do you know where they are in town?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: They are in the basement --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: They're all in the hotel?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: All that we are aware of at the present time are in the Mammy Yoko Hotel, the vast majority in the basement. Now, I cannot rule out that there may not be other Americans still in Sierra Leone, either in Freetown or elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would assume that in case, for example, of dual nationals there almost certainly are still Americans elsewhere in Sierra Leone. These individuals, both the Americans and the foreigners, for whatever reason, were not at the evacuation point for either of the evacuations that took place. We understand that they are there now in hopes of being evacuated, and, of course, every consideration will be given to doing that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: You said 12 to 30 U.S. citizens. Does that exclude dual nationals?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: No, that includes dual nationals. All American citizens are equal in our eyes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Reports this morning speak about a serious level of fighting; I mean, bombing everywhere. Do you think this is a thrust by the Nigerians to change the status quo on the ground in Freetown? And if it is, will it have the blessing of the United States?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: I cannot confirm the violence in Freetown of the scale, I think, that you are alluding to. Clearly, there has been fighting. No question about that. The degree of the fighting I can't confirm. Also I don't want to speculate on what Nigeria's actions or intentions are. We simply do not know. Of course, I have said before what the public statements have been for the Nigerian commander. I am unaware of any change in his public statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Anyone talk to the Nigerian Government at all?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DINGER: Yes, we're in touch in the Nigerian Government and I cannot contradict what they have been saying publicly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would reiterate that what we believe is essential immediately is a cease-fire, an end to the violence, the people of Sierra Leone have suffered enough violence. We believe the military clique should quit and should restore authority to elected civilian leaders. Then perhaps Sierra Leone can get back on track towards democracy and to some form of stability and prosperity for the people of that country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUSHBUCKRIDGE - The offices of the South African National Civic Organisation (SANCO), a school and a truck were torched during new violence over the Bushbuckridge border dispute this weekend, police said on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said the SANCO offices, which were next to the Mapulaneng Magistrate's Office, were burnt on Friday night, allegedly by pro-Mpumalanga demonstrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANCO chairman, Chrisjan Mokoena, last week urged all civil servants and students to go back to work and school.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ntsie Primary School in Health Centre, near Bushbuckridge was torched on Saturday morning and the damage is estimated to be more than R600 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A freight truck from Rustenburg Plant in North West Province was also ambushed and set alight on Sunday between Marite and Bushbuckridge. Police were able to put out the fire before the truck burnt out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have not arrested any arsonists yet, but we are following possible leads,&quot; said spokesperson of the Lowveld region of Northern Province, Captain Thomas Ramatseba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said some roads had been barricaded on Saturday and Sunday in Bushbuckridge and Marite, and that police were stoned but no one was injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We appeal to the people of Bushbuckridge to stop throwing stones at the police. We are there to keep peace and not to solve their border dispute,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bushbuckridge Border Committee (BBC) declared that this week would be one of mourning after a pro-Mpumalanga demonstrator, Sonto Khoza (18), was allegedly shot dead by police while toyi-toying after the Million Man March two weeks ago in Bushbuckridge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BBC spokesperson, Prince Ndlovu, said the committee wanted national Minister of Safety and Security, Sydney Mufamadi, and Northern Province MEC for Safety and Security, Seth Nthai, to explain why Khoza was killed.  A meeting planned for Thursday between the committee and MEC Nthai, to discuss the behaviour of police and the community during demonstrations, had to be postponed, however, as the committee would be attending Khoza's funeral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndlovu said an interdenominational prayer rally would be held at Paulianah Stadium on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bushbuckridge border dispute has left the Mpumalanga Environmental Affairs and Tourism Department with more than R200 000 debt after it had to pay damages to several tourists who were attacked and whose vehicles were damaged by protesters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department was forced to open the Albasini gate for visitors to the Kruger National Park, after the Kruger Gate road was barricaded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welcome Tours and Safaris spokesperson, Francois Grove, said the company lost several tourist vehicles since the start of the demonstrations, after pro-Mpumalanga demonstrators allegedly stoned the vehicles and tried to set two alight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said two American tourists were attacked at Acornhoek and had to leave their car at Hoedspruit as it was badly damaged.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Yesterday's Congress of South African Trade Unions' (Cosatu) strike cost the Western Cape's fragile clothing industry R10 million in turnover and R2 million in wages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Clothing Manufacturers' Association chairman Johann Baard said the losses were suffered when about 70% of clothing industry workers heeded Cosatu's call to strike against provisions in the Basic Conditions of Employment Draft Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosatu is demanding a 40-hour working week, to be phased in over five years, and six months' maternity leave, with four months paid, be included in the Bill.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The majority of factories have reported high levels of absenteeism,&quot; Mr Baard said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clothing, textile and leather industries are the biggest employers in the Western Cape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African Clothing and Textile Workers' Union (Sactwu) said in a statement that close to 90% or 155 000 of workers in the clothing, textile and leather industries did not report for work countrywide yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Chamber of Commerce and Industry spokesman Charl Adams said about 25% of Western Cape workers did not go to work yesterday. The building and clothing industries were the hardest hit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The strike was not as comprehensive as people said it would be. The Western Cape compared favourably with the rest of the country,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosatu's Western Cape secretary general Tony Ehrenreich, however, has challenged Mr Adams' estimate, saying that between 80% to 85% of employees in the province stayed away from work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African Chamber of Business (Sacob) labour affairs and social policy manager Janet Dickman said the strike was not supported as well as Cosatu had hoped. Support was patchy, with some industries reporting a 100% attendance figures and others 0%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mass support depended on how strong organisers were in the various industries,&quot; Mrs Dickman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She urged Cosatu to negotiate at the National Economic Development and Labour Council before embarking on actions such as calling for strike action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do not think taking to the streets is the appropriate way to achieve their aims,&quot; Mrs Dickman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sapa reported that absenteeism in KwaZulu-Natal factories ranged from 20% to 80%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durban Chamber of Commerce and Industries spokesman Neil McGregor said most workers had heeded the call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Johannesburg, council officials only reported hiccups in refuse removal and street sweeping services, Sapa said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - We need more people like Whitey Jacobs in our health system. With no formal medical training he heads a team of community health workers who offer caring and healing to the people of Brown's Farm, an informal settlement in Philippi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his work over the past 10 years, Whitey has been nominated as one of six finalists for the Soul City Health Care Worker of the Year Award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his quiet, unassuming way he passes this honour on, saying it should rather go to the people he supervises.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Explaining why, he tells the story of the community health worker called out at 2am to attend to a dying woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She spent almost 12 hours at the house, waiting for the woman's daughter to return, helping distraught family members deal with their loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community health workers, says Whitey, are respected, accepted and accountable to the people they serve and there's no such thing as &quot;off duty&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His brief is to co-ordinate 20 dedicated workers, a job which started out in a very different form when he joined the Health Care Trust 10 years ago and was trained to train others in First Aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born in Guguletu, where he still lives, Whitey joined the trust as a field worker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In 1986, I was secretary of the Emergency Services Group.  Then I was detained for two years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He doesn't elaborate, but talks rather about the challenges of setting up health services in an area where there was none.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From his work in a community in crisis, Whitey is well versed in the politics of health which includes the need for housing, sanitation and clean water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That struggle continues as does the struggle for Government recognition and remuneration for community health worker programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whitey's first major drive in the area was a door-to-door survey of 200 homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A community health worker programme was identified as top priority and workshops were held to decide what exactly this entailed. Seven community health workers were then chosen and trained by the Primary Preventative Health Care Network, an NGO with which Whitey still works closely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At that stage, there was no clinic in the area. &quot;Without medical and professional support, community health programmes cannot work. We needed a support base,&quot; Whitey says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negotiations with local councils followed and two clinics were built. But the process wasn't quite that simple, he says.  Before health committees could be formed and community health workers elected, leadership conflicts had to be sorted out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The trouble is that in a squatter community you can't work effectively if the leadership does not recognise you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whitey wears many caps: he's a problem solver, a life- skills trainer, co-ordinator and a support for his team of community health workers, the basic building blocks of primary health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their work is health education, first aid and curing basic diseases and they visit homes where they treat minor ailments and pick up problems like TB which would otherwise go untreated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People also visit them at home, and their work increasingly includes social services like counselling and advising on grants and pensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the formal primary health care clinics overflowing, community health workers offer an essential service to underserved areas, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're doing the Government's work. The CMC clinic closes at 12 and the province's day hospital, with its quota system, anything from 12 noon to 3pm. After that, people spill over to the community health worker.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ideally, there should be one community health worker for 250 homes. The reality is one for 500 to 1 200 homes. While not ideal, the system is up and running. Sadly, it faces collapse if the Government does not support it, and soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've been funded by the European Union. But then the EU said, 'look guys we're giving money to the Government, get it from them'. Right now we are operating without stationery, and that's just one example. I'm wondering if we will get paid this month.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funding for community health care workers is an issue not just for the Philippi project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Government makes public statements to say they support community health programmes, but practically they don't. They are not putting structures in place that would enable them to support CHWs. The whole question of CHWs is a reference only in the national health plan. We go to the Government for support, they say wait for the district health system to come.  That could be in 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the Brown's Farm community health worker programmes collapse, and you can't sustain people without remuneration, the Government will be sitting with a crisis,&quot; he says. &quot;Our major need is in fact a social worker to help with social problems. HIV is on the increase, so is child abuse.  Counselling is needed. People visit from the Transkei and are stranded. They don't know where to go and are sent to health workers' homes. It's a real problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whitey is working out ways to meet the challenge while he grapples with his nomination for the Soul City award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My feeling,&quot; he says, &quot;is that this award is for the community health workers, those that attend to dying people at 2am. I'm only part of that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Residents of the Gympie Street area of Woodstock are upset by what they term a return to apartheid tactics in an anti-crime raid during which police pulled down the front of a house</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police maintain that surprise is an essential element in arresting the perpetrators of crime, especially drug dealers who routinely destroy evidence when law enforcers arrive on the doorstep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one sincere about combating crime would take issue with this and it was no doubt the motivation for the weekend anti- crime raid on the Gympie Street area of Woodstock being carried out at 4am.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But where does &quot;surprise&quot; end and downright bullying begin?  Was is really necessary to attach a chain to a security gate in a wall during the raid and literally pull down the front of someone's home with a Casspir?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The picture of the wrecked facade in the Cape Argus yesterday must have sparked a sense of d ja vu among many readers, reminiscent as it was of the mayhem caused by jack- booted apartheid police storming into people's homes at all hours of the day or night in the interests of keeping a morally corrupt regime in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Memories of those days are still too fresh, the wounds too raw for police to expect support for that sort of behaviour, the paltry haul of 26 Mandrax tablets, some dagga and 18 crack crystals notwithstanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equally outrageous is the cynical remark by a police spokesman that in any case the gate and wall were &quot;not in accordance with building regulations because they were built too close to the road&quot;. Since when do the police have the right to administer jungle justice on behalf of the municipality?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While demands for action may put law enforcers between a rock and hard place in the fight against drugs, policing methods must be acceptable to society and the rights and dignity of individuals upheld regardless of who they are. Come on, George Fivaz. Where is this caring new police service about which we hear so much?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The multi-purpose sports stadium with a velodrome roof has to be finished in time for the World Junior Cycling Championships.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will also be the main venue for Olympic cycling events if Cape Town's bid to host the 2004 Games succeeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tygerberg chief executive officer Dave Wilken said good weather meant there had been no delays in construction. The roof-wetting took place last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The project is on schedule and will be completed by July 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe it will be something the Tygerberg can be very proud of,&quot; said Mr Wilken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council hopes to pay for the development with the proceeds of a 4,2ha land sale and by selling naming rights for the stadium. The Olympic Bid Company will contribute R5- million.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Cape Town's bid for the 2004 Games has earned the enthusiastic endorsement of world weightlifting boss Tamas Ajan, who says the organisation of the junior world championships here has been &quot;fantastic&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is Olympic-level organisation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">We could hold the senior event here, which is 10 times bigger, tomorrow.  Everything has been excellent - accommodation, meals, transport, security, documentation ... everything,&quot; Dr Ajan said at a briefing last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he admitted he was disappointed by the lack of spectator interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Entry to all events, continuing today and tomorrow at the Good Hope Centre, is free. A record 28 world records have been broken so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Ajan said he knew weightlifting was not particularly popular in South Africa, but hoped this would change.  Nevertheless, the high standard of organisation was a feather in the bid city's cap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you do the same for the World Fencing Championships (July 13-19) and the Junior World Cycling Championships (July 29-August 4), it will confirm that the African people and Cape Town citizens have what it takes to organise a South African Games,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Ajan predicted that Cape Town would almost certainly be in the final round of the vote for the 2004 host city when the International Olympic Committee meets on September 5 to choose the winner.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on the strength of the special supplement published in the Cape Argus last week to mark the 100-day countdown to the September 5 decision, they have had a change of heart.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After considering the arguments in the Cape Argus supplement, &quot;we have come to the conclusion that while there certainly are arguments against holding the Olympics in Cape Town, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, the wine estate is not alone. Barry and Mina Thomas of Jambo Guest House in Green Point have decked their building in bid flags and bunting and suggest all hotels, bed and breakfast establishments and guest houses should be challenged to do the same.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Police are at the centre of a row about heavy- handed &quot;flash raids&quot; on homes of suspected drug dealers.  During the raids, police demolish gates and walls to gain quick entry to houses to take the sleepy occupants by surprise and prevent them from destroying evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have defended their &quot;smash-and-grab&quot; tactics, saying the surprise element is vital for the success of the operations. &quot;It takes just a second or two to flush drugs worth thousands of rands down a toilet,&quot; said a seasoned narcotic squad detective.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police task force members backing detectives in drug raids routinely attach a heavy cable between a truck or armoured vehicle and the security gate or fence of the targeted house.  They then drive off at speed, forcing open the gates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in some cases sections of walls and even a roof have been pulled down in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the latest raid at the weekend, a house in Page Street, Woodstock, was extensively damaged when police used this method to smash their way in while the occupants were asleep.  They found 26 Mandrax tablets, a quantity of dagga and 18 crack crystals in the house, but their action caused an outcry in the community. Police spokesman Mark Romburgh said the gate and wall at the house, which were pulled down by a Casspir armoured vehicle early on Sunday, were &quot;anyway not in accordance with building regulations because it was built too close to the road&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The raid had been carried out with the necessary search warrants which empowered police to use &quot;required&quot; force, he said. &quot;Experience has taught us that if one knocks at the front door of a suspected drug dealer's house and spends 20 minutes politely requesting access, there is no surprise element and this gives the druglord time to destroy the evidence,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But notwithstanding the general air of apprehension among residents in the area as a result of intimidation by druglords, the feedback from the community was still overwhelmingly positive.&quot; Ron Paschke of the Human Rights Commission said he could not comment on the incident without having all the facts. The commission had not had any complaints about the police action, he said. In terms of the Criminal Procedure Act, there were certain circumstances under which police did not require a warrant to search premises.  These were if there was a reasonable suspicion a person in a house had committed an offence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The entire primary health system in the Western Cape, complaints about uncaring health workers and the ambulance service are to be probed by the team investigating the wheelbarrow death in Khayelitsha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was announced today by Western Cape Health Minister Ebrahim Rasool, who said he was extending the brief of the team appointed to look into the death of Thobeka Madayi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, the Cape Argus reported the death of Mrs Madayi in a wheelbarrow after she was turned away from the Nolungile community health centre in Khayelitsha.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her desperate husband, Vuyani Magazi, took his terminally ill wife to the clinic after being told no ambulance was available. When he arrived, staff told him they were closing and it might be quicker to get an ambulance from another clinic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Madayi died in the street on the way to the second clinic. The report prompted a huge response from readers, who made further allegations about the uncaring attitude of health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also highlighted the crisis at clinics and in the ambulance service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Rasool said he was giving the team more time to look into broader problems in primary health care in the Western Cape. Its report would have &quot;a profound influence&quot; on the provincial health system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had given the team until June 13 to report back and had broadened its terms of reference to enable it to identify other factors affecting primary health care delivery. The team would also investigate complaints directed at the health department.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - Namibia's ruling party, Swapo, does not have a proper list of its own members and admits to being &quot;administratively and technically weak&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is revealed in the Central Committee's report to the recently completed party Congress. The report states somewhat bluntly: &quot;No party can call itself a political party without a list of its members. The Secretariat must employ all the resources at its disposal to commence immediately with the compilation of a Party Membership register.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Central Committee urges that a computer database be used to register members efficiently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members have also been called on to pay 0,1 per cent of their salaries to the party, however the report states that &quot;few members have been paying their membership due or contributing 0,1 per cent of their salaries&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two organisations affiliated to Swapo - the National Union of Namibian Workers and Nanso (affiliated) - have also never paid their affiliation fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report recommends that in future membership fees should be collected through sections and branches and that every full-time employed member of the party pay 1 per cent of their monthly salary to the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the claims that party businesses are now worth N$150 million, the report states that &quot;today the only assured source of income for the party are newly-established companies which did not reach the break-even stage&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report paints a bleak picture of the party's finances and internal organisation stating that the party &quot;remains administratively and technically weak&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is in contrast to a rather rosy section of the report on Swapo companies which claims that they have increased the value of their assets sevenfold since independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the report holds out the hope that the party will become financially stable through the funding of political parties approved by the National Assembly .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the new funding arrangements the party is set to receive nearly N$6 million of taxpayers' money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the failure to raise funds through a paid-up membership, the report maintains that the party managed to pay its staff between 1993-1997 and fund national and regional election campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the last financial year the party spent N$2 391 971 and received N$2 555 782. No further details are given about the nature of the expenditure or income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report concedes that a high turnover of party employees has &quot;dealt a blow to the administrative efficiency of the party. The 'flight' of staff to the Government and private sector is put down to the fact that the party &quot;could not afford the most basic conditions of service such as monthly salary, medical scheme and pension ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The main reason why these committed cadres have left the party or are unavailable for the work for the party as full- time functionaries is attributable to the total absence of a scheme of employment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report says that &quot;as long as this state of affairs is allowed to continue working for the party will remain unattractive as it offers no material benefits&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a remedy the CC recommends the introduction of contracts, job descriptions, and proper conditions of employment including benefits such as pension and medical aid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - Swapo's businesses are worth an estimated N$150 million and are expected to escalate in value to N$250 million by the end of March 1998, according to a Central Committee report tabled at the Swapo Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report says that party assets assigned for business amounted to just under N$20 million in 1990. The more than sevenfold increase is attributed to the efficient management of party assets and &quot;tremendous added value&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CC report also claims that the party has created employment for more than 5 000 Namibians through its business ventures and that another 4 500 new jobs are in the pipeline.  &quot;Many foreign investors are knocking on our doors for joint ventures,&quot; the CC report adds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also revealed that Swapo has been investing in &quot;strategic economic sectors&quot; in two neighbouring states.  Although the countries are not specified it is believed that they are Zimbabwe and Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report recommends that all the party's businesses contribute monthly to a trust through which money could be disbursed to the party and to invest in &quot;healthy portfolios&quot; to ensure maximum returns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swapo has established four main business arms - Kalahari Holdings (a 100 per cent holding company of Swapo), Zebra Holdings (100 per cent of shares owned by Swapo), Guinas Investments (a non-active investing company with 100 per cent of its shares owned by Swapo) and Namib Graphics ( a printing company wholly owned by Swapo).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalahari Holdings has a number of subsidiaries which include Namib Contract Haulage and New Dawn Video.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report alludes to problems concerning the party's entry into the business world, stating that some party members perceive that &quot;the incompetent, undisciplined and lazy should find employment in the party business entities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Such people completely ignore the professional and businesses ethics and any control is construed to being victimisation, political, nepotism, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attitude often expressed is that 'since the company belongs to the Party, it belongs to nobody' and as such warrants a free for all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report complains that any achievement by the Swapo businesses is regarded as resulting more from Government favouritism rather than hard work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swapo also runs two NGOs - the Centre for Resource Transformation (CERET) and the Swapo Veterans' Trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The central committee proposed that CERET be assigned to the Swapo Youth League, while the Veterans Trust already falls under the Elders' Council.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - The environmental study on the proposed pipeline linking Namibia's central areas to the Okavango river will be submitted to the Botswanan government for review before the next stage of detailed fieldwork is carried out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Botswanan government has said it would only be able to take a stance on Namibia's plans to draw up to 20 million cubic meters of water each year from the shared river once the entire feasibility study had been completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final impact assessment statement is expected to be completed in the next three months. According to a report compiled by Water Transfer Consultants following meetings held in Botswana between Namibian Water Affairs officials and local communities, Botswana's main concern appeared to be the effect the pipeline plan would have on the Okavango Delta.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recently completed study indicated that Namibia's plans to draw water from the Okavango river would have an insignificant effect on the delta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During consultations with Namibian water authorities at Shakawe in Botswana community leaders said the delta was already drying up. They feared that if Namibia was allowed to draw water from the Okavango, the people and animals of the delta would perish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said they saw no reason why they should allow Namibia to pump water from the delta while they had rejected a similar proposal by their government earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questions also arose during the consultations over whether Namibia had exhausted all potential aquifers or even considered the desalination of sea water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Department of Water Affairs deputy permanent secretary Richard Fry explained during the meetings that getting water from the sea would be far more expensive for Namibia compared to tapping water from the Okavango.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said more details would be provided after the environmental studies had been completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has also been estimated that future water demand in Namibia will grow from about 295 million cubic meters a year in 1995 to about 600 million in the year 2020, making it imperative for Namibia to seek other alternative sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a second meeting at Gumare, similar concerns to those raised at Shakawe on the possibility of the delta drying up were raised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Maun, the consensus among the local community was that consultations should take place after the feasibility study was completed and submitted to the authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Namibian Government is expected to make a decision soon with regards its approach towards the pipeline plan after reviewing the environmental impact study.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision was originally expected to have been taken at a Board meeting scheduled for Friday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting has, however, been postponed to next week Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Air Namibia acting managing director Johannes Gawaxab said recently that the national carrier was close to finalising the acquisition of the replacement for the 747 SP which services the airline's intercontinental routes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gawaxab said the national carrier was looking at a cost- effective aircraft although he could not say what types of plane had been short-listed as possible replacements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final decision was entirely in the Board's hands, he added. However, sources have indicated that the Boeing 777-200 and Airbus 340 are among the hot favourites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Air Namibia, which is involved in negotiations with German carrier Lufthansa on a possible partnership agreement, has completed a feasibility study on the possibility of a Windhoek to New York flight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Gawaxab, all the national carrier now had to do was to find a strategic alliance partner for the route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, if all goes according to plan, Air Namibia could be flying to New York sometime between June and December next year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - The following is background information on recent developments in Sierra Leone following the military coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JUNE 2, 1997: The Sierra Leone army is still headquartered at Cockrill Defense Headquarters in the Aberdeen area.  Unconfirmed reports state that the Nigerian negotiation team offered each of the Sierra Leone coup organizers, at an 8 p.m. meeting on June 1, 1997, financial support (of US$10,000, a house) and asylum in Nigeria if they agreed to leave the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Revolutionary United Front (RUF) representative Colonel Desmond refused to accept the terms and immediately went on the air via FM 99.9 (SBLS) to announce the military's planned 27-member National Ruling Council (NRC) government comprised of military officers, six RUF members, and two civilians. The NRC includes President Tejan Kabbah's former Secretary S.A.P.  Bayoh, his former Chief of Army Staff Brigadier Hassan Conteh, and his former Chief of Defense Staff Brigadier Max Kanga.  Charles Margai, the second civilian announced on the NRC list reportedly refused to accept the position and is now in hiding. RUF leader Foday Sankoh is slated as Vice President in NRC.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately after the RUF radio announcement, the Nigerian negotiating team broke off talks and returned to their base at Bintumani Hotel giving the Sierra Leone army and RUF an ultimatum to decide by 12 am on June 2, 1997 as to whether they would accept the proposed offer. As of the deadline, no talks have taken place between the Nigierian negotiators and the coup leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extensive firing at the Mami Yoko Hotel, which is secured by United States marines and Nigerian soldiers, was reported during the evening of June 1 after a group of Sierra Leone uniformed entered the hotel premises and started threatening Nigerian soldiers and civilians. Prior to this, U.S. boats and marines were still landing at the Mami Yoko Hotel to maintain security and facilitate the evacuation of remaining U.S.  citizens. Non-governmental organization employees, citizens from neighboring African countries, and some Lebanese citizens were also being transported to Conakry, Guinea, by what is believed to be a private boat located behind Nigerian gunboats in the Lagonda area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the morning hours of June 2, Nigerian gunboats retaliated by firing from their location at the Lagonda area at the Cockril Defense Force army base. A British military advisor to the Sierra Leone army was wounded in the Lagonda shootout and as of late afternoon the death toll had reached 10 army casualties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the early afternoon of June 2, the Sierra Leone army commenced firing at the Bintumani Hotel where the ECOMOG troops and the Nigerian negotiating team are based. ECOMOG has also taken control of the OAU Village residential area, an affluent nieghborhood where Lebanese, former government ministers, and diplomats were living. ECOMOG has secured the area and is restricting access to it because there is a route through the neighborhood to the peninsula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of individuals demonstrated on June 2 in support of the army marched from Eastern Freetown starting in the Up Gun Turntable area towards the center of the city and through to the National stadium on Savage Street. It is believed that the army organized local youth and RUF soldiers in plainclothes to demonstrate and express their solidarity with the the coup organizers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Approaching from Hastings Air Field, east of Freetown, soldiers looted the Sierra Leone Port Authority after demanding that the local security force leave the area. The looted goods were loaded and transported to Hastings Air Field where it is believed soldiers could easily enter the bush if a full-scale military intervention occurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main hospital is closed because all the medical supplies have been looted and medical personnel refuse to go to work because of the security crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of early evening June 2, the Mami Yoko Hotel was on fire with occupants hiding out in the basement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International is urging African leaders -- who are meeting at an Organization of African Unity (OAU) summit in Harare -- to demand that President Laurent Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire) investigates the latest massacre in his country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As many as 123 unarmed civilians were reportedly gunned down on 26 May by members of President Kabila's new army in South-Kivu region's Uvira town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Kabila should immediately initiate an independent and impartial inquiry into the massacre and bring to justice any soldiers found responsible,&quot; Amnesty International said today. &quot;We are appealing to African leaders to show at the OAU summit that the safety and physical integrity of human beings in ex-Zaire are more important than the country's mineral wealth.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources in Uvira have informed Amnesty International that about 10 people were shot dead on the night of 25 to 26 May by gunmen believed to be members of the Alliance des forces de(/)mocratiques pour la libe(/)ration du Congo-Zaire (AFDL), Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire. On 26 May several hundred people gathered in Uvira town to demonstrate against these and other killings by the AFDL in and around Uvira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrators, apparently carrying the bodies of the people killed the previous night, came from Kasenga, Kabindula and other localities of Uvira. The demonstrators met up at Kakungwe where they were reportedly intercepted by members of the AFDL. One soldier is said to have talked to his superiors on radio and soon after, the soldiers opened fire, killing as many as 123 demonstrators. The Uvira District Commissioner (Commissaire de zone) was reportedly shot and wounded in the incident.  The circumstances are however unclear. He is reportedly hospitalized at Roi Khaled Hospital in the Burundian capital, Bujumbura.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International is concerned that many world leaders have chosen to ignore the AFDL's shameful human rights record. Most of them have pledged support to rebuild the shattered infrastructure of ex- Zaire, but virtually none have committed themselves to help the country's new leaders improve their human rights record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the wake of the military victory of Laurent Kabila and his forces, there has been an eagerness to welcome the new government and to downplay widespread human rights violations,&quot; Amnesty International said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laurent Kabila and the AFDL leadership have persistently denied reports of massacres by the AFDL, yet they have refused to accept independent and impartial inquiries. At the start of May 1997 they refused to allow a United Nations (UN) mission led by Roberto Garreton, the UN Special Rapporteur on (ex-) Zaire, to investigate reports of widespread massacres and other human rights crimes committed in eastern Zaire by the AFDL and other forces. After the UN Security Council expressed at the end of May 1997 concern at massacres of Hutu refugees by the AFDL, Kabila's government reportedly said in an official statement, &quot;These so-called continuing massacres of refugees are defamatory and invented by those who failed to prevent the fall of the dictatorial regime in our country&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kabila cannot be allowed to hide behind the dark veil of the very poor human rights record of former President Mobutu Sese Seko,&quot; Amnesty International said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gross human rights violations by Mobutu's forces cannot serve as an excuse for the AFDL and its allies to massacre thousands of unarmed refugees and ex-Zairian civilians with impunity. A population which has suffered human rights abuses for decades deserves and must expect better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This massacre is the latest in a series of deliberate and arbitrary killings by the Tutsi-dominated AFDL since October 1996 when they launched an attack against forces of former President Mobutu Sese Seko.  Thousands of unarmed civilians, mostly Rwandese Hutu refugees and (ex-) Zairian Hutu, are reported to have been deliberately and arbitrarily killed. Congolese (ex-Zairians) from other ethnic groups suspected or known to be sympathetic to the Hutu and others thought to be hostile to the Tutsi have also been targeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around Uvira, tensions between the AFDL and members of the Vira, Bembe and Fulero ethnic groups considered to be opposed to Tutsi domination have been high. The AFDL is reported to have summarily executed members of these ethnic groups in South-Kivu on suspicion of belonging to armed groups opposed to the AFDL.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - Amnesty International expressed grave concern at the use of excessive force by Kenyan security force personnel in breaking up a rally in Uhuru Park, Nairobi, earlier today, and called for the authorities to exercise restraint in dealing with any future rallies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several thousand people were peacefully being led in prayers by Bishop Njoya in the park when police and paramilitary forces fired teargas into the crowd without warning and violently dispersed those gathered. During subsequent disturbances in central Nairobi, police and General Services Unit (GSU) personnel arbitrarily beat bystanders as well as those involved in demonstrations and looting.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The teargassing and beatings meted out to peaceful protesters was unwarranted and excessive, particularly since the law under which the government declared the meeting illegal contravenes international human rights standards which Kenya has ratified,&quot; said an Amnesty spokesperson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A high level Amnesty International delegation, led by Secretary General Pierre Sane, is due to arrive in the country on Sunday to launch its Human Rights Manifesto for Kenya, and meet with representatives of the government, political parties, non-governmental organizations and religious leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The manifesto sets out reforms essential to improving human rights, including the repeal of legislation such as the Public Order Act, which was invoked by the authorities to prevent the meeting taking place, and calls on the government to bring Kenyan legislation into line with international standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kenya has ratified the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which protect the right to freedom of association denied today,&quot; the spokesperson added. &quot;This latest incident shows the importance of the reforms outlined in our manifesto in ensuring that the fundamental rights of all Kenyans are protected in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The authorities should set up a prompt and impartial investigation into today's events, ensure that those responsible for using excessive force are brought to justice, and that the security forces follow international guidelines when dealing with future rallies.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Text of questions and answers on Sierra Leone by State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns at the Department's daily briefing June 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Nick, can you bring us up to date on Sierra Leone?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I would be glad to, yes. First of all, we continue to pay a lot of attention to the situation in Freetown. It is quite worrisome.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, as you know, the United States completed a third evacuation of 12 Americans and approximately 1,220 other nationals this morning from Freetown; so, almost 1,200 - 1,232, approximate, people came out this morning from - to the Kearsarge. All evacuees were taken there. They will be flown to Conakry in Guinea today and tomorrow. That brings the combined total of individuals evacuated by the Kearsarge, by the United States since Friday, to approximately 2,530 people and that includes 440 Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, we do not anticipate any further evacuation from Freetown because we think we have got all the Americans out who want to come out.  There may be a couple of Americans left who absolutely insist on staying. We cannot force people to leave, although we strongly encourage all Americans to leave and we strongly encourage all Americans not to travel to Sierra Leone given the continued fighting there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As you know, the effort to bring about a peaceful resolution of this conflict has not succeeded. The United States is using our diplomatic skills and capacity to urge the coup leaders to quit and to restore to power the democratically elected government of Sierra Leone. We are working with a number of countries on that. We will continue to keep this situation under close review. Our ambassador, Ambassador Hirsch, and his DCM will be in Conakry in Guinea for the time being, watching out for American interests and helping those Americans who are coming out of Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: The reports we're getting seem to indicate that the Nigerians are getting the worst part of the battle and have, in fact, been beaten back. Is that what you hear?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Well, I think the official rationale -- as John has explained it to you over the last couple of days -- of the Nigerian Government is that their forces are there to restore - maintain order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, obviously, there has been some fighting between the Nigerians and the rebels. Our position is that we think there ought to be a peaceful resolution here, but the end result should be that the rebels step down and that they give up their fight to control the government by dictatorial means and they restore the democratically elected president of Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: There is at least one report that hundreds of Nigerian troops have been captured and are being used as shields by the rebels or the coup forces. Do you have any knowledge of that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Well, since we have evacuated our embassy staff and our ambassador, we are not in a position to confirm those reports, but we have seen those same reports. Betsy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Nick, do you have any knowledge of relief workers being held hostage?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I'm looking at John because John, as you know, has been here. I haven't heard either. Have not heard anything about that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: NBC had heard that some church workers were being held hostage. I don't think it was in Freetown. It was out in the countryside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Just haven't heard anything about that. Yes?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: There are reports that yesterday's attack was meant to prepare for a more comprehensive one. What is the U.S. response to that?  Do we support the more comprehensive attack?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Attack by the?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Nigerians. The firing of shells yesterday by the Nigerians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: We support a restoration of the civilian government. We hope that that can be produced by negotiations with the rebels. We have not taken a position of direct support for the Nigerians, but we do support the ambition, the objective that the rebels cannot win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They cannot succeed in overthrowing a democratically elected government and installing in its place a bunch of military officers who don't know how to run a country, who haven't been given that mandate by the people of Sierra Leone. They ought to step down. That's our position.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - When the Cape Argus team visited 15-year-old Nathan Ludick at his modest Philippi home, we found him playing outside with his younger brother and sister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He looked every bit the protective older brother looking after his siblings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Difficult to imagine, then, that only a week ago he had never before laid eyes on his younger brother and sister. He is only now beginning to get to know them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What makes this family's story different from others is that Nathan left home at the age of eight and grew up on the streets of central Cape Town. Living a life of petty crime, his situation could so easily have had disastrous consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, his life took a new turn when he returned home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Nathan, his cloud seems to have a silver lining and for this new beginning he has Linda Ntshinga and the Homestead programme to thank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Linda is a street worker on a programme called Masithethe (let us speak), aimed at rehabilitating street kids and getting them to return home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the Masithethe programme was launched on April 1, Linda has managed to get Nathan and six other children off the streets and back to their homes. He also has interviewed 69 new children.  Of these, 38 were new to the streets, 23 had been attending the Yizani Drop-Inn Centre and eight were runaways from existing Homestead programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Linda, a 24-year-old SACS matriculant, and the co-ordinator of Yizani, and Shane Egypt are entrusted with making Masithethe a success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is his job to patrol the streets, making contact with the children and establishing which ones are new arrivals. He has to gain their trust and try to refer them to Yizani, where many street kids come for meals and a little much-needed attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Linda then tries to make contact with the street kids' families to see what the home environment is, with a view to getting them off the streets and back home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a hard and thankless job, but Linda feels the reward comes when he is successful with children like Nathan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nathan's story is similar to that of many others out on the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born in De Doorns, he grew up in Belhar where he got along well with his friends and regularly attended school. Then his family moved to Philippi and he started mixing with the wrong crowd. He got caught up in petty crime, later refusing to attend school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One day, seven years ago, Nathan and some friends took the train to Mitchell's Plain. When they tried to return home to Philippi, they found they had caught an express train which took them straight to Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That day was the last time Nathan saw his home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He met up with another group of friends in Cape Town and started a life of crime on the streets, where he was influenced by other streetwise kids. He used to sleep in shop doorways and begged for food and money. To survive the cold, he sniffed glue and thinners regularly and got involved with a group who stabbed and robbed people in the city centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He continued this lifestyle for several years, but an incident two weeks ago made him change his ways and leave his life on the street - hopefully for good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leader of the group with which Nathan moved around was shot and killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Linda's help, Nathan returned home and is now back &quot;forever&quot; and about to start working with his father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says his father used to drink, but has since stopped. He feels things at home are &quot;going well&quot; and he does not want to return to the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His wish for the future is simple: &quot;I am going to work and save money. I want to be a father of the house. I feel happy here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I met Linda and Shane at the Yizani Drop-Inn Centre, bustling with destitute street kids who were looking for a hot meal and a shower. The kids do not stay at Yizani, but go there as a stopover before returning to the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the kids come to Yizani, Shane and Linda try to motivate them to attend formal programmes and get them to sleep at Homestead's shelters. They then try to establish contact with the families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Linda says: &quot;Masithethe's main objective is to return children to their communities, so that they do not get too streetwise. I keep in contact with the kids to establish which ones are new. I try to build trust between me and them and then try to refer them to formal programmes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What makes the Masithethe programme different from others is that it does not stop once the kids return home. Linda and Shane try to network with community structures, such as soccer clubs, to try and get the children to fit in. They do follow-up visits and take food parcels to the families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poverty is the umbrella cause. In some cases, there is a total breakdown of family structures and children are left to their own devices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outlook for street kids is bleak in most cases, but Linda is the perfect candidate to work with these kids, and he knows the importance of his job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I grew up in the communities they come from, I am ploughing back what I have got from the community. It is a great job,&quot; says Linda.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Six policemen accused of beating a man and blinding him five years ago were found innocent by the Nelspruit Regional Court on Monday because the man was unable to identify them in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court also found the policemen innocent after a state witness failed to testify on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Magistrate Albertus Le Roux said that because state witness, John Mashinini, did not testify, the court did not have enough evidence to sentence the suspects.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the complainant, Prince Ngomane (31) also could not identify the people who assaulted him because he was now blind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his testimony two weeks ago, Ngomane alleged that he was arrested without explanation on April 22,1992, after police mistakenly assumed that he had assaulted Constable Sydney Dibakoane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngomane testified that he was taken to Hazyview Police Station where Dibakoane allegedly beat him on the face and blinded him in his left eye. He added that Constable Anton Jan van Dort, Jakobus Petrus Mosterd, Albert Madala Msimango and Sergeant Coenraad van der Merwe had also assaulted him</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On arrival, I asked Dibakoane why I was arrested but instead he grabbed me by my clothes, slapped me on the face and punched me in my eye, which closed,&quot; Ngomane had testified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sergeant Emmanuel Banda confirmed some of Ngomane's story and told the court that he found Ngomane in a holding cell even though he was not on the prison register.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I found out that he was injured, I organised for him to be taken to hospital and also told Constable Msimango to release him at once,&quot; Sgt. Banda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six officers were also accused of stealing R75 from Ngomane but were found not-guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is hard to sentence these six people because Ngomane could not identify the people who really assaulted him&quot; said Magistrate Le Roux.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - A massive explosion On Friday rocked a Jamaican registered oil tanker undergoing repairs at the Apapa ports in Lagos resulting in three people killed, according initial reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of Lagos ports security, Navy Captain Shuaibu Amodu, blamed the explosion on a gas cylinder being used for welding job on the ship, al-Zainab, docked at the Commodore anchorage.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vessel was set alight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the blast was under investigation to determine casualty and whether safety measures were breached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ship, which was severely damaged was saved from total destruction by the timely arrival of men of the ports fire service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some terrified Lagos residents suspected the explosion was a continuation of the several bomb blasts that had rocked the city in the recent past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria has witnessed eight bomb explosions in as many months, six of which in Lagos and all but one targeted against the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military government has blamed the country's pro-democracy groups for the terrorist attacks, a charge denied by the groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sixteen people, including exiled Nigerian literature Nobel Prize laureate, Wole Soyinka, have been charged with the bombings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state-owned New Vision newspaper said Friday it has learnt that the decision has been endorsed by the German Development Agency (GTZ), which is funding the 15.5-million-U.S.-dollar project to build roads, staff houses, park headquarters, bridges and other infrastructure in the 3,840 square miles (6,144 sq Km) game park.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two-year project began last year. The paper said the UPDF and the Uganda Wildlife Authority had confirmed the new arrangement. But the GTZ representative in Uganda, Luecke Irmgard, was not available for comment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The privatization of the Pan African News Agency and the proposed setting up of a radio station for the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) will be the major issues at a conference of African information ministers to be held in Cairo from June 17 to 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAU spokesman Ibrahim Dagash told the Zimbabwe Inter-African News Agency, Ziana, in Harare on Friday the conference would be preceded by a one-day session of the Inter-governmental Council for Communication in Africa (ICC) on June 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last ICC conference was held in Sun City, South Africa, in October 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Major issues which will dominate debate will be the ICC programme of action for 1997-99, privatization of the Pan African News Agency (PANA) and the setting up of an OAU radio broadcasting station,&quot; said Dagash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OAU, which established PANA in 1979 as its print media agency, now intends to establish radio transmission to broadcast programmes that would be called &quot;Voice Of Africa&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Such a project is very important at the moment because the OAU is trying to be very relevant and to be known to the ordinary African,&quot; said Dagash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The radio, we believe, is still the most far-reaching medium accessible to the African majority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have had a recording studio in Ethiopia since 1990,&quot; said Dagash.  &quot;It is a radio recording studio which we need to upgrade into a radio broadcast station which will transmit our programmes throughout Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On PANA, Dagash said plans to privatize the cash-strapped agency by December this year have firmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said, however, that member countries had to pay off arrears totalling 40 million U.S. dollars first before the exercise could be effected. But the OAU needs only 4.7 million U.S dollars to clear the debts of the agency, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a member country paid a certain percentage of its arrears, the outstanding amount would be written off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Privatization of PANA is due by December this year,&quot; said Dagash.  &quot;After that member states will be relieved of paying contributions to the agency as it will be functioning on commercial basis without losing its African character.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the members fail to pay the required 4.7 million dollars, this will eventually lead to the death of the agency,&quot; he warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PANA, which was established in 1979 to counter negative publicity of Africa by western agencies, started operating in 1983.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry's Director-General Ibrahim Hashim, said Thursday while receiving a French delegation in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, the military government would provide adequate number of teachers for the programme.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are an estimated 9,000 French language teachers in Nigeria, but some 22,000 are needed, the education official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hashim said France have agreed to grant scholarship to Nigerians annually for intensive French language study in Paris.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political observers say nigeria's new fraternity with France could be a response to its isolation from the United States and other Western nations over democracy and human rights issues.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KINSHASA, Congo (PANA) - Congo's central bank has said that large quantities of the country's new currency, the Congolese franc, has arrived at its premises in 50 and 100 franc notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The currency, which will replace the new Zaire which circulated under the administration of Mobutu Sese Seko, will be put in circulation as soon as the 1 franc, 10 centime and 50 centime coins are minted by l'Hotel des Monnaies in Kinshasa, the Bank of Congo said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new franc will be backed by the country's gold reserve, the United States dollar and the South African rand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said Thursday that the new currency will exchange at 2.50 francs to the dollar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Introduction of the new currency was announced on May 29 by Congolese President Laurent Kabila, when he was sworn in at the Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will substitute the new zaire with a healthy and strong Congolese franc,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former Congolese franc disappeared following the monetary reform of June 24, 1967. This gave birth to the zaire which was initially valued at one zaire to two U.S. dollars. But the zaire plummeted in value leading to the new zaire in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday in Kinshasa, the new zaire was exchanging at the rate of 140,000 to the greenback.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria's Super Eagles paid dearly for, perhaps underestimating their Kenyan opponents when both countries met almost six months ago in an African group one qualification match for the World Cup in France 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that match, the Harambee Stars stunned the Olympic Champions and forced them to a goalless draw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With that bitter lesson from lowly-rated Kenya, soccer fans in Lagos warn that the Kenyans, fresh from a tour in Germany, would be no pushover in the crucial second leg match Saturday in Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerians cannot forget a 1977 nightmare, when the Eagles conceded an own goal against Tunisia in Lagos that sent their country out of the World Cup in Argentina.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, the Eagles are in a similar circumstance. They require only a win to guarantee their second World Cup appearance after an impressive performance in U.S.A. '94.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, from all indications, Nigeria's preparations for Saturday's encounter has been anything but smooth, at least not with the now familiar practice of players arriving late to camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite adequate notice not all the invited players made it to the national camp in the eastern city of Enugu by Thursday, when the team was due in Lagos for the last work out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After prolonged controversy, Enugu was literally imposed on the Eagles' new French technical adviser, Phillipe Trousier, who had preferred Cote d'Ivoire. It was to Cote d'Ivoire that he took his team to prepare for the two previous group matches against Guinea in Lagos and Burkina Faso in Ouagadougou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However Troussier, who is barely three months on the 10,000-U.S.- dollar a month job, has not known any peace for winning a scrappy 2-1 victory in both matches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, criticism has poured in from Nigerian soccer fans to sports writers and administrators. The debate has been such that there have been calls for the termination of his six-month contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Troussier did not help matters by overstaying in a foreign trip, perhaps in protest. When he finally returned, the national camp was not full enough for any full-scale training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such was the level of preparation that a disappointed sports minister, Jim Nwobodo, lambasted the players when he visited the Enugu camp to meet only about 15 of the invited 22 players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To add to the confusion, there was a report of the planned visit of Clemens Westerhof, the Eagles' erstwhile Dutch handler. He was said to be desperately keen to retrieve the job he abandoned three years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was also considerable talk that Frenchman Claude Le Roy was also gunning for the coaching job. He was interviewed before Troussier was chosen in February after Johannes Bonfrere, from the Netherlands, abandoned Nigeria for Qatar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonfrere had taken Nigeria to win Africa's first Olympic soccer gold in 1996 before quitting unceremoniously alleged disagreement with Nigerian sports authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Nigerians are not new to what sports enthusiasts here call &quot;shoddy preparations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They point to the fact that many had written off the Eagles, just before they won the Africa Nations Cup in Tunisia, 1994. The same team went on to put up a superlative performance at U.S.A. '94.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, sports commentators warn that no two matches are the same: The fact that Nigeria got away with inadequate preparation in 1994 is no guarantee it would repeat the same feat three years later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is in view of the fact that the Kenyans, bristling with confidence, have bolstered their morale with the prompt announcement of their squad for the match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Harambee Stars' German handler, Reinhardt Fabisch, has also been working quietly to transform the Kenyan squad, a feat that has earned him an extension of his contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenyan confidence also stems from the fact that they are the side that have exacted a point from the Eagles in the March to France '98.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya's victory over Guinea, which counts as an advantage to the Eagles, led to the reported disbandment of the Sylli Nationale, the Guinean squad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Players to watch in the Kenyan line-up include Musa Otieno and Mike Okoth, a hat-trick hero in their dramatic 4-3 victory over Burkina Faso in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria's four-goal hero, Daniel Amokachi has, however assured that there is no cause for alarm. He says the Kenyans won't pose a threat to the Eagles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Team skipper Uche Okechukwu also says the Eagles are aware of the importance of the match to the country's qualification for the World Cup finals. One commentator has said only an outright victory in Lagos that will make the Eagles' last group match against Guinea in Conakry a formality, would be good enough for Nigerians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will do our best,&quot; Okechukwu said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Maj. Gen. Victor Malu, commander of the West African Peace Keeping Force in Liberia (Ecomog), said Thursday that a planned military action to reverse the May 25 coup in Sierra Leone had not started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had some skirmishes which we undertook just to protect ourselves,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was speaking to journalists on arrival Thursday in Lagos for consultations with Nigerian authorities on the situation in Sierra Leone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were fired upon and we had to return fire and in the course of that we sustained some casualties,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He declined to elaborate, although other reports had put the death toll from Monday's exchange of gunfire at between 50 and 80 with several others injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malu is also in charge of a battalion of Nigerian troops and a team of military advisers in Sierra Leone under a military pact between both countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pact was in effect before the coup led by Maj. Johnny Koromah and his colleagues in the of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The putsch has been roundly condemned by the international community, including the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malu denied another report which said some 300 Nigerian soldiers were held hostage by the coup leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said there was not need to panic over the non-evacuation of Nigerians from Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the movement of troops from Liberia to Sierra Leone, Malu said: &quot;I can't afford to substantially deploy my men to Sierra Leone, very few and essential few have been moved to Sierra Leone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is in Nigeria to confer with the head of state and chairman of the 16-nation Economic Community of West African States, Sani Abacha. They will discuss action to take in restoring democracy in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malu said that Ecomog troops in Sierra Leone are consolidating after the cease-fire that followed Monday's exchange of gunfire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The battle was between Ecomog troops in Freetown and the combined team of troops loyal to the coup makers and elements of the rebel Revolutionary Unity Front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebel leader Foday Sankoh, who had been in a hotel in Nigeria since March as guest of the military government, has urged his rebels to joint forces with the coup makers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malu noted that Ecomog's strong stance had convinced the coup makers on force's resolve to sort out issues militarily if necessary.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Union of Bus Drivers and Motor Taxis Association of Zambia (UDMTA) has rejected a Lusaka City Council (LCC) order to shift from their current bus stations to an incomplete site in the light industrial area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Association chairman Haggai Mambwe said in Lusaka yesterday that the drivers would not move because the council had flouted procedure and the proposed new station was undeveloped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mambwe said the LCC should have given his association written notice through a statutory instrument and develop the area before shifting their location.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his association had, in fact, been asking the city council to allocate it the site they are now being forced to go to so that they could develop it from as far back as 1995 but to no avail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not going to the new station because it has no toilets, water, passenger shelter, security lights, police post and slab concrete nor tarmac,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LCC using police yesterday ordered drivers who had parked their vehicles at the Mandevu, Chaisa, Chelston, Matero, Lilanda, Kaunda Square, Sekelela and Chunga bus station to move to the new site off Mumbwa road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mambwe condemned the use of force as illegal saying police failed to produce a letter empowering them to move all the drivers to the new site. The LCC and United Transport and Taxis Association (UTTA) agreed to temporarily shift the station to the new site to allow contractors working on Freedom way and Lumumba road do their work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UTTA Lusaka branch administrator Harrison Mukupa emphasised that the new station was a temporary site and advised all drivers to cooperate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr Mambwe said it was time the council came up with proper plans of developing the city instead of instituting temporary measures which inconvenienced both drivers and passengers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The numbers of pregnancy-related deaths in Zambia are among the highest in the region, Health Minister Katele Kalumba has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Kalumba said the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) rose from 118 in 1982 to 940 out of 100,000 live births in 1990 and it was now estimated to be between 650 and 730 out of 100,000 live births.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pregnancy-related deaths are on the increase, we have been trying to save the children while losing the mothers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These deaths are due to moral, political and scientific problems,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Kalumba said this when he launched the National Family Planning Policy Document at Hotel Intercontinental in Lusaka on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said unless something was urgently done to arrest the loss of mothers' lives, the nation would have to take the responsibility of many orphans and the creation of more orphan institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia's population growth rate of 3.2 per cent was one of the highest in Africa which meant that the population would be too high for the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministry, through the implementing institutions, would ensure the protection of the family planning client against medical malpractices like interference by the providers' personal opinions or preconceived bias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministry would continue to review existing legislation to ensure that health personnel were not at risk, legally or otherwise, in implementing family planning strategies and standards contained in the document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Kalumba said the purpose of the policy framework strategy and guidelines was to support and guide central hospitals, especially at district level, in the planning and implementation of the family planning component of their reproductive health programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Government supported the African Charter on Human and People's Rights which stated that the state had a duty to protect and promote moral and traditional values recognised by the community and to protect and assist the family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These same values, however, are under threat today from a variety of sources among which are urbanisation, technology, poverty and the HIV/AIDS spread,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - ZAMNET managing director Shila Habeenzu was yesterday grilled by the Bobby Bwalya Unza/CBU Commission of Inquiry where he failed to explain why the two chief executives held personal shares in the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Habeenzu, 37, of Chamba Valley fumbled and gave contradictory statements over why ZAMNET shares were sold to specific individuals who among them included Health Minister Katele Kalumba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairman Justice Bwalya and other commissioners were surprised to learn that the University of Zambia released K1m to buy shares for Andrew Siwela and his deputy Jorry Mwenechanya and demanded to know whether the amount was a loan or advance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Habeenzu said he was not present at the time ZAMNET was initiated and therefore was unable to answer the questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said ZAMNET was established under a $120,000 World Bank project which among others demanded that the company be a private entity run by the university and whose shares would gradually be sold to private individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank did not want the university to have more than 51 per cent shareholding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the university paid out K1m to cover shares for the then registrar Jean Calder (750) Siwela (125) and Mwenechanya (125).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1994, shares amounting to 125 were sold to Dr Kalumba, then Health deputy minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On why the shares were not floated publicly, Mr Habeenzu claimed the shares would have been too expensive and when pressed further he said Unza would have not managed to satisfy that many subscribers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He assumed Dr Kalumba was approached to buy shares because of his commitment and dedication to electronic networking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said dividends had not been claimed by the shareholders since inception as the money was ploughed back for re- capitalisation but he could not say how much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither could he confirm whether the decision to set up ZAMNET and the shareholding was ratified by the University Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr Habeenzu, I fore-warned you that it was premature for you to come before this commission. You clearly have no answers to the pertinent questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a pity that you are not aware of what your organisation is all about. We are impaired because you have no knowledge of who gave birth to ZAMNET,&quot; Justice Bwalya said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner John Muliokela said as much as ZAMNET was a well-intentioned initiative, it was important to account for public funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier during his submission Mr Habeenzu said ZAMNET was paying Unza $340 a month in rent although the institution owed it K3m in arrears for subscription.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lecturers and union leaders earlier this week submitted to the commission that Prof Siwela and Mwenechanya had registered themselves as businessmen on the ZAMNET board and were declaring dividends.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Police are investigating whether the Kabwe building in which a suspected human skull and bones, two coffins and priestly robes were found is still the Masonic temple it used to be in the 1960s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also want to establish if the skull is truly that of a human being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Central Province police chief Sassassali Nungu said in an interview yesterday the Masons had used the building in 1967 when they were registered in Kabwe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police questioned the proprietors of the building but later freed the three men because there was no law under which they could be prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said police were yet to establish whether the activities of the Masons had continued in the same building after 1967.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We could not continue holding the three. They denied having any links with the Masonic Association and did not know where the items discovered in the building came from,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Nungu said police were medically examining the suspected human skull and bones found in the building which is widely believed to be a temple of the Masonic Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said police did not know the members of the Masonic Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Medical authorities need to ascertain whether the bones that were found in the building are human bones. It is also important for us to establish how the bones landed into the temple,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police acting on a tip-off raided the building near Kabwe Civic Centre and found two coffins, a suspected human skull and bones and church robes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Samfya villager beat to death his 72-year-old uncle after suspecting him of practising witchcraft, Luapula Province police chief Oliver Chibwe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chibwe said yesterday the incident occurred on Tuesday at 1500 hrs. Police are holding the suspect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trouble started when the suspect accused his uncle, Obina Mibenge, of bewitching a relative who had died in the village.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspect descended on his uncle hitting him with a metal object until he died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident occurred at Mabo-Kunda village in Chief Kalasa Mukoso's area.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Sweden has promised to continue to assist Zambia but urged the Government to engage in dialogue with the opposition to access balance of payment support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swedish ambassador to Zambia Kristina Svensson (above) said this in Lusaka yesterday when she officiated at the inauguration of the upgraded and rehabilitated Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (Zesco) national control centre.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Svensson said her government was pleased with the steps Government had taken on good governance but implored it to engage in dialogue with the opposition to resolve political differences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sweden, would however, continue assisting Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sweden is supporting political dialogue between Government and the opposition because in a democracy all parties must give their contribution to peaceful and prosperous development of the nation. When we see this dialogue taking place we will consider to release our balance of payment support,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She hailed Zambia for undertaking the liberalisation and privatisation exercises with great commitment. But the privatisation of the ZCCM and the civil service reform programme were cardinal in Zambia's economic recovery programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sweden is conducting extensive research on new methods of generating of hydro-power from which Zambia will benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Energy and Water Development Minister Suresh Desai said at the same function that $200m was required to overhaul plant and machinery of Zesco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Desai said Government was currently working out measures to raise the $200m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the money would come from donors. He said the existing generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure installed over 30 years ago was slowly breaking down and almost grinding to a halt.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Thinly disguised personal vendettas are a worrisome cocktail at the hearings at the Bobby Bwalya Commission into the University of Zambia and Copperbelt University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the submissions elicit reactions ranging from bewilderment to incomprehension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is just too much mud being thrown at the individuals in the Unza administration.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking the pulse of unfolding submissions, we wonder whether any administration can weather such storms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We hope with bated breath that no one is using the occasion as wanton license to vent selfish interests and petty jealousies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, there is every reason to believe that some submissions are laced with dangerously derisive tones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We appeal for submissions to be modest and seasoned with the utmost caution. Let all those making submissions guard their tongues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They must not veer off-tangent or else we shall have no Unza left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission of inquiry has been turned into a firing squad of sorts with the administration standing bound hand and foot, blindfolded and mute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, we are left wondering what is happening to the primary quest for what causes the persistent interruptions at the institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are those who appear to have turned the sittings into a hot commodity for political professionals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some rabble-rousers even in their student days, now turned lecturers, should be rowed back from their acid presentations against individuals in the administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We concur with the commission's chairman, Justice Bobby Bwalya, that submissions should not miss the boat in a big sort of way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The thorny issue which needs dealing is the endless closures of the institution. Some say there is a likelihood of tribal sentiment in the pudding; some are accusing the administration of weighing heavily towards some province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's very unfortunate coming from some lecturers who themselves are a moral epidemic in our education institutions and not otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's true some things have gone wrong at Unza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the fallacy of generalisation should be tamed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lecturers must also bridle their penchant towards the feeling of bitterness for the administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ours is an appeal for level-headedness in their submissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The submissions must therefore be tailored to save the institution from collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need to hear sober submissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bad-mouthing are only a potent symbol of small minds and failure.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - A senior civil servant has expressed concern at the wanton destruction of woodlands through charcoal burning in Central Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the World Environment Day at Munyama primary school on the periphery of Kabwe yesterday Central Province acting assistant secretary, Thomas Nkwanga, said Government was very much concerned about environmental degradation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deforestation, soil erosion and shifting cultivation should be addressed seriously because they brought about poverty among rural communities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Statistics show this every year due to charcoal production alone. If this state of affairs continues, there will be very few forests in few years to come especially in Chibombo and some parts of Mumbwa district,&quot; Mr Nkwanga lamented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He explained that deforestation led to soil erosion, then siltation of streams and rivers resulted in shortage of water for agricultural activities, animals and human beings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He attacked illegal settlements in forest reserves; settlers clearing large tracks of land for farming and charcoal production were disturbing the whole ecosystem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that there were 8000 illegal settlers in Munyama forest reserve engaged in cutting down trees for charcoal and agricultural production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Nkwanga appealed for cooperation from various ministries and departments and local communities in solving environmental problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry of Education should play a big role in disseminating information on the importance of the environment to youths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Young people are important partners and allies in raising environmental awareness and triggering environmental action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is by creating awareness today that we can hope to promote conservation and prevent future environment destruction,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He appealed to them to play an active role in environmental issues because they would next century shoulder the burden of decisions taken by today's leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Nkwanga called for good management and wise use of all natural resources to ensure sustainable development because the environment was a source of essential raw materials and inputs that support human activities with regard to food, water, shelter and wood.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The excited fans are walking the streets of Johannesburg bleary-eyed with sashes of Zambian national colours draped around their necks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday, the South African Football Association (SAFA) went to Johannesburg airport to welcome Zambia but the team never came out of the plane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a psychological ploy! The Press is shouting here. The Johannesburg's 'Star's' story on Zambia's alleged failure to arrive began &quot;Zambia yesterday fired the first salvo in the psychological war in the build-up when the visiting squad failed to arrive at the Johannesburg International Airport&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 'Star' explained how bemused and surprised SAFA officials were to find only Zambian ministers Ben Mwila, Samuel Miyanda, Sonny Mulenga, Kaunda Lembalemba, Reverend Peter Chintala and Member of Parliament Christopher Chawinga and supporters alighting from the plane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAFA spokesman Bucks Molatedi explained how the plane had got full in Lusaka forcing Zambia to re-schedule their arrival to Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The very partisan 'Sowetan' newspaper has meanwhile warned Zambian coach George Mungwa not to rate South Africa by the side beaten 1-0 in 1992.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Last Saturday in the Dutch town of Hengelo Haile Gebrselassie missed out by a whisker on a million dollar pay-out for becoming the first man to run under eight minutes for two miles. By comparison, Hendrick Ramaala's fifth place finish in the 10 000m for a new South African record of 27:36.30 was a modest effort- nearly a minute behind Salah Hissou's current world record of 26:38.08.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For local athletics, however, it was an important step forward, picking up from the renaissance of 1995 when Ramaala and Shadrack Hoff brought South African distance running out of a lengthy period in the doldrums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramaala was the revelation of the 1995 season, coming from nowhere to finish as the first South African home at the world cross country championships and reach the 10 000m final at the world championships in Gothenburg with a respectable personal best of 27:54.59.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year was fraught with injury problems that kept him out of the world cross country championships and saw him perform poorly in Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year is Ramaala's first as a full-time athlete after graduating from Wits with an LLB last year. There are not too many articulate, black sportsmen from humble rural backgrounds who have got themselves an education and been to the Olympics, but when Ramaala went looking for sponsors he received some surprising responses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One company representative told Ramaala they wouldn't get value for money out of him. He said a well known sprinter races week-in-week-out for them and if Ramaala wanted to come on board he would have to do likewise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out of necessity rather than desire Ramaala went to Europe at the end of December to race on the World Cross Challenge circuit, earning himself more than R30 000 by the time he returned at the end of January and placing him second in the rankings after five races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That money came in handy for Ramaala who rented a flat in Johannesburg's Berea's for himself and his two younger brothers whom he is helping through their studies. It was not the smartest move for his long- term plans, however, and while he was over in Europe's freezing winter he lost much of his endurance base. He could still have rescued his situation though had it not been for the ridiculous requirements of Athletics South Africa who insisted that any athlete wanting to go to the world championships in Athens should qualify at least once in the local season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only opportunity to do so at the coast this year was at Port Elizabeth on February 14. A crash course of speed sessions proved insufficient and he failed to make the mark.  His dismal performance at the world cross country championships in March further underlined what has been obvious for too long now. South Africa's elite middle- distance runners cannot run the world cross country championships and the local track season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we run the world cross country championships then my thinking is that we mustn't run on the track until April,&quot; says Ramaala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a sponsorship from Mr Price under his belt Ramaala rested after the world cross country championships and then started building up for Athens. &quot;My overall mileage was up to 200/215km a week which is the most I've ever done. I could never do that before but now I have the time to train and rest in between. I was also doing gym work three or four times a week,&quot; says Ramaala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Going back to the formula which saw him do so well in Gothenburg Ramaala built up his endurance and used cross country league races to gauge his fitness and gain confidence. &quot;I was training right up until last Friday (the day before the race in Hengelo) so I didn't have any speed but I didn't blow because I had good endurance,&quot; says Ramaala</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I heard before the race that there would be three groups and I decided to stick with the lead group who were aiming to go through 5 000m on 13:30 pace ( that's 27 minutes for 10 000m!). I went through 5 000m in 13:43 and just stayed behind the leaders. With four laps to go I went to the front to push the pace a bit,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 600m from home the sprint for the line began and Ramaala couldn't respond. &quot;My stomach began to turn and I wanted to throw up. It showed I hadn't done my speedwork so I decided to reduce my pace a little.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He eventually came fifth but clipped more than three seconds off Xolile Yawa's 10- year-old South African record and paved the way for even greater things. &quot;I wasn't tired.  It felt like any other race and I believe any of our top runners can do it with the same training.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The modest Ramaala is likely to beat them to it though because when he sharpens up with some shorter races over the next month and gets ready for Athens at the beginning of August he could find he has a lot more in reserve.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The 1997 British Lions could not be further removed from their celebrated battling ancestors. The game has moved on and the Lions are hell-bent on moving with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it's true that the Lions need to have more edge and tightness in their forward play, their primary concern as they swing towards the pressure cooker of provincial programmes - Northern Transvaal, Gauteng (Transvaal), and Natal within eight days starting on Saturday - is to harness their resources, play a wide, free-wheeling game and not stand toe to toe with any local enforcers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They'll be tough and muscular when they need to be. They know too what they can offer in that department. They are unsure yet quite what they can offer in other parts of the field. They know what they would like to offer, but we have yet to see sustained evidence that brazen theory can be translated into harmonious reality.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lions have declared their hand. They are looking to play a fast, interactive, seamless game where forwards and backs merge as one in the hope of destructuring the tightly choreographed defences of the modern era. &quot;We want to play in a way that the South Africans don't expect us to play,&quot; says their coach, Ian McGeechan. &quot;We don't want to be loose but we do want to play on the edge. We want to be ambitious and not to play in a straitjacket.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McGeechan's is a high-risk strategy in any context. With the Lions, who have existed as a team for just a few weeks, this is an audacious roll of the dice. It is also the right one. And if there is one player who convinces you of the fundamental correctness of the approach it is Jeremy Guscott.  The style of play is a perfect fit for the game's most bespoke player.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guscott scored two tries against Eastern Province. He was sharp, elusive, threatening and commanding. He shepherded the new boy, uncapped centre Will Greenwood, beautifully, with a mix of paternal care and bullish youth and confidence.  Guscott's defence was also impeccable. So little is made of Guscott's shrewd, robust tackling. He is no gilded butterfly, a precious species craving gentle handling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guscott is the all-round centre, which is precisely why he should play there and not be shunted sideways into the wings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The temptation to play him on the wings will be overpowering. The one area in which the Lions are spoilt for choice is at the centre. Any of Scott Gibbs, Allan Bateman, Alan Tait and the Tigers tyro, Greenwood, would grace a Lions side. Guscott has the pace, balance and perception to play on the wing, as he showed with devastating effect when he came on in that position for England as a half-time replacement against Wales. (Jack Rowell's decision to omit Guscott last season appears more crass by the day.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all this, the Lions would be wrong to play him out there. If their ambitious game plan is ever to come to fruition they need Guscott's withering thrust, his drifting angular runs, his probing intellect, to be in play as often as possible. To remove him from the heart of the action would be to muffle the side's creative potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The McGeechan medley of options is music to the ears of Guscott, the star turn of the cabaret who has so often been reduced to the role of bouncer, turfing out intruders and performing the menial chores of chasing kicks and harrying defenders. &quot;Yes, I do wish the new laws had arrived 10 years ago and we had played this type of rugby,&quot; said Guscott, who will be 32 two days after the final Test. &quot;It's my kind of game. In fact it's not just me who feels liberated by it; everyone does. The message is clear. We have to forget the numbers on our backs. The props have to play like centres, the centres like props. If you watch the Brazilians play football you don't know really whether they're defenders or attackers. That's the aim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no Plan A and Plan B. There is a format, and we have to fit in to it and react accordingly. I'd be disappointed if we didn't take advantage of the opportunity now. And, yes, my aim is to play centre.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lions have brought the best out of Guscott. This is his third tour and this is his natural habitat. His flickering genius finds true and more lasting expression among the more talented ranks of the Lions. The well- disguised competitive beast that is the real Jeremy Guscott the rugby player - the sardonic, laid-back persona is a mask of convenience to bemuse and distract - rises to the challenge of the Lions environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is special,&quot; says Guscott. &quot;It's hard to explain precisely why because it is like one of those warm, private family moments which sound daft when you describe them to outsiders. But when everything clicks, when it all comes together and everyone is thinking and reacting the same, then it's a great feeling. I look around the squad and I think, 'Well, why can't we come through?' The whole tour party is very lively, very positive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guscott was smiling last week. No wonder. The British game is finally heading his direction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A victory against Zambia on Sunday will go a long way towards sending Bafana Bafana to the World Cup in France, but nothing is certain in the unpredictable Group Three.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The moment of truth for World Cup hopefuls South Africa and Zambia arrives on Sunday when they clash at FNB Stadium in a match likely to determine which country visits France next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While victory and three points is the obvious goal of Bafana Bafana, even a draw will suffice provided they complete their programme on August 16 with a home win over surprise packets Congo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia, so close to reaching the finals four years ago, must win to have a realistic chance and it can only boost their confidence to know that they have never lost a competitive match against South Africa. Going into the fifth qualifying round, Congo and South Africa share top spot on seven points with the Red Devils in the driving seat because they have scored more goals. Zambia lie third with five and the Democratic Republic of Congo fourth with two.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last January, Zambia were held goalless at the Independence Stadium in Lusaka by a South African team which enjoyed two moments of good fortune in a disciplined if somewhat uninspiring performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was typical of clashes between the powerhouses of Southern Africa, a physical showdown between countries who regularly cancel each other out simply because there is so little to choose between them. A prominent South African coach, speaking on condition of anonymity this week, said he feared the day might not be too far off when South Africa were at the wrong end of a hiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What a pity England chose to omit six of their recognised first-team at Old Trafford as it would have been interesting to see how Bafana Bafana coped against the SAS (Alan Shearer and Teddy Sheringham.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While football is too strange a game to predict anything with much confidence, it would come as a major surprise if more than one goal separated the teams when dusk descends over Soccer City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the midweek Nelson Mandela Inauguration Challenge against Holland, coach Clive Barker is likely to rely largely on those players who have ensured glory for him and the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means the No 1 jersey returns to Andre Arendse; the defence revolves around captain Lucas Radebe, Sizwe Motaung, Neil Tovey and Mark Fish; Eric Tinkler, Doctor Khumalo and &quot;Shoes&quot; Moshoeu man midfield and Philemon Masinga leads the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That leaves vacancies in midfield and attack with John Moeti and Linda Buthelezi vying for the former and Mark Williams, Brendan Augustine and Jerry Sikhosana the latter.  Form, fitness and the &quot;gut&quot; feel of Barker will determine the lucky twosome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia have not been altered radically by new coach George Mungwa with young Davis Phiri still guarding the goals, Modon Malitoli, Elijah Litana and Harrison Chongo in defence, Andrew Tembo and Johnson Bwalya in midfield and Dennis the Menace (alias Lota) up front. No big match in Africa would be complete without its share of rumours and those emanating from Lusaka suggest former African Footballer of the Year Kalusha Bwalya may come out of self- imposed retirement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mungwa says Kalusha has answered the call of the nation in its hour of need, but even if the Mexican-based midfielder lines up at FNB Stadium, there is no need for South Africa to suffer a collective heart attack. Bwalya was kept under control for large spells of the Lusaka encounter and while still a potential matchwinner, he appears to have lost some of the sparkle that saw him crowned king of African football 10 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bafana Bafana hardly need to be reminded, though, just how deadly he can be from set pieces, an area where South Africa remain sadly lacking in thought and execution when these precious opportunities arise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While war is raging in Johannesburg, the battle of the Congos will unfold at the notorious Municipal Stadium in Pointe-Noire with the visitors needing a victory to keep alive their wafer-thin hopes of qualifying. Apart from taming the Devils, the former Zaireans could suffer from an identity crisis with a new blue and gold strip replacing the green, red and gold, a new national anthem, a new nickname and a new coach from Brazil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congo, exposed during the closing stages of a three-goal loss in Zambia, know a victory will take them to FNB Stadium still in contention for a place at the showpiece of international football. More than any other African section, Group 3 has proved to be unpredictable, and who can safely predict what may develop this weekend. What is certain is that unlike the other four qualifying groups, no team can book its tickets to Paris on Monday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - There is something about a Springbok side without Kobus Wiese and Hennie le Roux that brings thoughts of a hamburger without the full beefiness of the patty, sans the lip- smacking enjoyment of the relish, immediately to mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not to say that coach Carel du Plessis has done a bad job in picking his debut side for the Newlands Test against Tonga that marks the start of an extremely crowded season of internationals. And, for the most part, he has stuck to his principles in picking the players he perceives to have been the form men of the past few months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andre Joubert and James Small might skim the very edges of this definition, but then both are players of undeniable world class.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joubert, for as long as he wants to make the green and gold No 15 jersey his own, must come automatically to the mind of any selector. His recent injury and nascent return to the game surely gave rise to some second thoughts on his current abilities, but much of this doubt was instantly erased in the stirring second half he produced in the semi- final of the Super 12, as Natal fought back against impossible odds to run Auckland a lot closer than the eventual champions would have believed possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small is a different consideration. Fiery to the point of instant inferno, he has languished for a good part of the season on the Western Province bench. He remains an enigma. A loner in a sport which demands an adherence to the team ethic, Small is capable of some of the most superb running defence, the most sublime finishing, and yet still manages to embroil himself in the type of petulant exchanges that marked his shoving match with British Lion John Bentley that belies every bit of his street-smart demeanour that expects you don't get cross, you get even.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to return to the coach's decision to leave both Wiese and Le Roux languishing not just on the reserve bench, but out of the international mix altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To take the case of Wiese first, if we are to take the simile of America's favourite snack that bit further and starting with the beef, the selectors have ignored the willingness to come back - more than likely prematurely - from injury of one of the most honest forwards in the business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It smacks very much of the pressure that was put on Francois Pienaar last winter to play himself through some severe physical damage. Ultimately, the result has been the same ... Test oblivion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 33, Wiese may not be in the long-term plans of coach Du Plessis with the spectre of a World Cup championship defence looming less than two years away. But then there is the small matter of a three-Test series against the Lions, and the bruising round of tri-nations Tests against Australia and New Zealand which follow to consider. The thought of a Springbok scrum giving ground against any of these teams is too horrific to contemplate, yet it is something that looms very large and very real in the present composition of the Springbok second row.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Du Plessis has plumped for Krynauw Otto and Fritz van Heerden as locks against Tonga. It is an interesting choice.  Otto is also just back from injury and has never been known - at international level, at least - to own the resilience that a fisting from a Robin Brooke or a Warwick Waugh demands of a Test second row. In this regard, Braam Els of Free State must count himself extremely unlucky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Heerden is different. A retreaded flanker, who has - like Small - played all his rugby this season outside Super 12, he is an untried quantity at this level of lock forward play, despite his proven abilities as a lineout jumper. It reads like a very thin meat patty indeed, and one can only be thankful that the ever- dependable Hannes Strydom is there as a back-up when the grilling starts, and that Mark Andrews waits impatiently in the wings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of Le Roux's exclusion for Edrich Lubbe of Griquas, the same doubts hold sway. The overriding feeling is that Louis Luyt typification of the quicksilver three- quarter as &quot;a quitter&quot; has gained far more credence than such a gutter utterance should ever have been allowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Le Roux remains one of the world's premier broken-field runners and has forged a world class partnership in the centre with Japie Mulder that has allowed both men to feed off each other's strengths and blossom into a truly feared and respected combination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is ironic that while the Lions are looking for combinations, we are busy dismantling them. Equally interesting that league returnee and Springbok centre veteran Pieter Muller has come back into the frame against the Lions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muller represents one of the inconsistencies in the way Du Plessis has arrived at his line-up. In his insistence on form men, he has picked a load of players from the minor provinces and those who have not played Super 12, and yet he is insistent that leaving English emigrees Francois Pienaar and Joel Stransky out of the reckoning was because they were not playing a high enough level of rugby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coach's emphasis on form does not hold water in Stransky's case. Honiball has had a string of uncertain and erratic performances and surely cannot have been a sure choice on his current playing portfolio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Du Plessis has also looked toward the 1999 World Cup in Wales and chosen younger players like Percy Montgomery from Western Province, and yet stayed with the old brigade in many instances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of it really adds up, no matter how sincerely Du Plessis may espouse his cause. The sum of the parts will probably prove better than the whole - Springbok rugby tends to do that - but the recipe is a somewhat bland and tasteless one in the anticipation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Test team against Tonga: Andre Joubert, James Small, Japie Mulder, Edrich Lubbe, Andre Anyman, Henry Honiball, Joost van der Westhuizen, Gary Teichmann (captain), Ruben Kruger, Andre Venter, Krynauw Otto, Fritz van Heerden, Adrian Garvey, Naka Drotske, Os du Randt.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The standard of this year's Loerie Awards was higher than in previous years, and the competition stiffer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the advertising industry is still struggling to relate meaningfully to a multi-cultural society. This is the view of several judges and competitors at South Africa's most prestigious advertising awards extravaganza.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Held with customary pomp at the Sun City Superbowl, the highest accolades - three Grands Prix and 12 Loeries - went to Hunt Lascaris TBWA, for BMW's airbags cinema commercial, Imperial car rental's TV commercial and the magazine ad for Playtex Wonderbra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second place went to DDB SA which won three Grands Prix and nine Loeries. Unlike Hunt Lascaris, who won for above- the-line advertising, DDB was rewarded for its below- the- line campaigns for the Johannesburg Art Gallery, and in categories for promotional marketing, graphic design and direct marketing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Grands Prix went to Ogilvy &amp; Mather Rightford Searle- Tripp and Makin for Volkswagen in the outdoor category and a social services ad for the Transport Department. They also earned six Loeries. Net*work won two Grands Prix in the press/magazine and newspaper categories for the Virgin Atlantic campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet beneath the hip hype, cutting edge concepts and trendy images, overall there was an absence of South African identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the same token that we can talk about what characterises Australian movies or a British sense of humour, I think South Africa is still in the process of finding itself,&quot; said Nkwenkwe Nkomo, one of the few black judges at the awards. He believed looking for a local identity affected the advertising industry as much as any communication or arts field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His observations reinforce those of John Farquhar, editor of Advantage magazine - a respected trade publication. In the June issue, Farquhar quotes Nizan Guanaes, head of Brazilian agency, DM9, and one of the Loerie judges, as saying: &quot;The work I saw could easily have been produced in New York or London. There is nothing uniquely African about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farquhar adds: &quot;Too many of our creatives are not creative in the true sense of the word. It is easy to lift an idea for BMW created by better creative brains in Europe or the States and tweak it so that it communicates to the few international citizens living in this country. The sad thing is that the South African 'creative club' approves this style of advertsing creativity by rewarding those who practise it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But many insiders agree that there were refreshing exceptions to this internationalist rule. These included several award-winning outdoor advertisements that focused on reaching as broad a market as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was also the Virgin Atlantic Airways campaign featuring a gorilla lock commonly used to prevent car theft securing the controls of an aircraft, above the words &quot;Our latest destination, Johannesburg&quot;. Net*work creative director Mike Schalit believes the campaign &quot;hit the button at the right time&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while Schalit disagrees with the view that local agencies tend more often than not to emulate their overseas counterparts, he agrees that not enough in the industry are uniquely South African.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while Nkomo is steadfast in his belief that most local ads lack a South African identity, he admits that what he refers to as &quot;bongo-bongo&quot; ads - which feature appropriated Ndebele design or a Basotho blanket - also do &quot;not make adverts black&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Glynis O'hara speaks to veteran songbird and survivor Tandie Klaasen about the release of her new CD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's been years - 24 years, in fact - since Tandie Klaasen's face was set on fire in a senseless attack. &quot;So don't call me burnt face,&quot; she says now, &quot;just call me Tandie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People still remark on it, she adds. &quot;They still say it.  But I'm The Voice, I'm not The Face.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And to prove it, she's recorded an album of her own again, the first one since Love Is Strange, which predates her attack. It's a long time for someone like her - who started performing again a year after the incident and has never stopped since - to go without a recording. In fact, it's bizarre that it's taken so long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it's only really due to Belgian interest that it happened at all. The new CD is called Together As One (Music For Africa/HKM) and was financed by the Arts and Culture Trust, set up by the Department of Arts and Culture, Nedbank and Sun International.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Belgian connection grew through alternatiewe Afrikaans singer Johannes Kerkorrel, who has made a career for himself in the Benelux countries as well as here. Belgian star Stef Bos worked with him and came out to South Africa, where he met Tandie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their first three-way collaboration resulted in the marvellous song Awuwa, recorded in 1993, incorporated on Kerkorrel's Cyanide in the Beefcake album and a was a hit in the Benelux countries. That song is also on this album, as are a range of other co-compositions between Stef and Tandie, from two blues songs to ballads to good old-fashioned 1950s pop in the jivey Kikirikiri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Essentially though, it is a move away from her well-known blues style, although she'll always do the blues, jazz and African jazz in live shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is the music I wanted to do,&quot; Tandie, now 65, says in a shouted interview at the raucous Bassline in Melville between sets. &quot;I'm really glad Stef discovered me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been wanting for so many years to do the right music with a message to South African people. He was just the right person at the right time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now there's a message about my life on the CD and that'll help because people are always asking me about my life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We speak after the Sibikwe Players, led by Smal Ndaba, have left the stage and left the room resonating with Fifties images and music in extracts from Kwela Bafana. &quot;Aren't they great?&quot; she says, swelling with pride for the new, younger generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But like most South Africans, Tandie is having a hard time keeping her head above water these days. She may perform a lot, but she has no car, &quot;because it was stolen and it was uninsured. They've broken into my place in Eden Park nine times. Write that down, write that! Nine times! Haai. I work hard for what I get and they keep on breaking into my house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She's been the epitome of the blues in South Africa for so long though, that a move away from the style seems to mark a sea change. Is she happy now? &quot;Haai,&quot; she says, gazing into the middle distance, &quot;I don't know what happiness is. I've lost all my family (10 of her brothers and sisters have died, as well as her mother).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I should have been sharing my first CD with my family, but instead it's with friends and people in the industry who have helped me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But mention her singer daughter Lorraine, based in Canada with her husband Ignace Lumumba, nephew of the late Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba, and her face brightens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She's on tour in Louisiana right now. I performed with her in a festival in Barbados in January, along with people like Roberta Flack, Tanya Maria and Grover Washington.  Roberta dedicated The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face to me.  Imagine that ... to me. It was one of the greatest, most moving moments of my life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lorraine, 12 at the time of the attack on her mother, was the one person who stayed at her side throughout her recovery. They're still very close, and as a result, Tandie has toured Canada with her in a show called Soweto Groove.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tandie was attacked the night before she was to go to Japan to sing with Nina Simone. It happened at a &quot;friend's&quot; house as she entered, and the stereo belted out a tune from her first solo album. Two young men threw petrol over her face and set her alight. One of them subsequently got three years in jail for it, the other was never found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The story is legendary. Everybody knows it. Plastic surgeons built up her mouth again, grafted skin from her thighs to her face and reinforced her neck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It took her a year to recover and appear on stage again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What few people realise though, is that the incident and its fallout seriously harmed her career at a point when things were looking really promising. She also lost her husband as a result of the burns and for a short while turned to the bottle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Canadian friend who saw her at the Civic Theatre in Johannesburg six years ago was completely bowled over by her energy, passion and charisma. &quot;She's the only person I've seen here who I think could've made it in Europe or the Americas,&quot; he said. &quot;She's a real star.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Mira Nair, director of the controversial Kama Sutra, has moved to Cape Town. She spoke with DAVID BERESFORD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The story is told of how one of South Africa's most powerful black women was involved in a minor traffic accident with a white motorist recently. Mamphela Ramphele, vice- chancellor of the University of Cape Town, former director of Anglo American and one-time lover of Steve Biko, was ruefully contemplating the scrape on the side of her BMW when the white woman admonished her: &quot;Just wait until I tell your madam about this!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recounting the tale, Mira Nair, resplendent in a silk kurta bundi, gives a fair imitation of India's bandit queen - dark eyes flashing at the memory of a skirmish much relished, if only vicariously. For a moment there's a hint that one of India's most combative film-makers may have rested her ever- roving eyes on a new battlefield and that South Africa might add another illustrious name to a pantheon of social activists who have fought the good fight on the tip of this benighted continent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But her attention is on the world's biggest democracy, rather than its youngest. As she leans over her laptop computer in anxious search of e-mail on the progress of her struggle with the Indian censors, it's apparent that Nair's heart is not where her latest home is - set gloriously, though it is in the shadows of Table Mountain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The director who has brought Indian cinema out of the backwaters of Bollywood to world attention, with the likes of Salaam Bombay! and Mississippi Masala, seems to have done it again with her latest, Kama Sutra. Subtitled &quot;a tale of love&quot;, it might be better described as a tale of Asian sexuality - and one seemingly much appreciated by audiences as it chalks up box-office records from America to Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town seems an unlikely location in which to discover Nair and she herself appears mildly surprised to find herself in the land of recent apartheid. A film-maker who, cinematically at least, has one foot determinedly planted in the United States and the other on her home continent, the choice of Africa to set up house offers geographical compromise as the only apparent rationalisation. But it is a passion discovered in Uganda which brought her by a roundabout route to Francis Drake's &quot;fairest Cape in the entire circumference of the world&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have this odd, deep connection to Kampala,&quot; she says dreamily. &quot;It's funny. I am not from there, had never been there, went there in 1989 to research Mississippi Masala, met Mahmood, fell in love and my life changed.&quot; Professor Mahmood Mamdani, distinguished Ugandan political scientist with the looks to set a Bollywood producer scrambling for contract forms, became Nair's second husband after her break-up with the New York photographer, Mitch Epstein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Kampala shared the passion. &quot;It reminded me of the small town I grew up in in India. We bought the house that is in the beginning of Mississippi Masala - that little house that has that amazing view. I planted my first garden there and I became a gardener, sort of ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have kept the house in Kampala, but moved to South Africa at the beginning of this year with their five-year-old son, Zohran, when Mahmood took up a post as director of African studies at the University of Cape Town. So now home is an imposing three-storey house set on the lower slopes of Table Mountain with panoramic views over the &quot;mother city&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa has to some extent found Mira Nair - she is fast becoming a feature on the local artistic landscape - but she has yet to return the compliment. Gesturing out the window she says: &quot;It pretends to be the Riviera ... It clicked into place when someone said that here even the vegetation is imported. Then I understood why it felt weird.  It is not itself, it has many-times borrowed cultures and as a result it does not stay within me - it sort of washes away when I leave it ...&quot; The same cannot be said of India, where Nair's battle with the censors, which has already become something of a cause c'l bre on the sub-continent, is her current pre-occupation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has always been provocative edge to Nair, from her childhood. Her father was something of a grandee, albeit in the ranks of bureaucracy - one of the first cadre of Indian civil servants who filled the administrative vacuum left by the departure of the British Raj. His only daughter was born in Bhubaneswer on the south-east coast of India some 300 miles south of Calcutta. An outstanding student, her temperament was ill-suited to the provincial school in Orissa, an all-girl establishment which was more of an ante- room to the marriage chamber than a forcing ground for the intellect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her complaints to her father were met with an invitation to identify the school's shortcomings. Nair did so with the dramatic flair which was later to drive her career - submitting several essays written in gibberish. When she presented these - complete with the &quot;A's&quot; awarded for the nonsense by her admiring, but sadly uncritical teachers - she won herself an instant transfer to a convent in the Himalayas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There the Irish nuns proved her equal and she moved on, via university in Delhi, to Harvard. Studying drama, she graduated summa cum laude with a documentary for her thesis - made by walking a camera through the streets of the Moslem community of Old Delhi, recording their reaction to a woman behind a lens, instead of a veil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a stint of waitressing between scraps of film work she raised the funds for her first documentary, So far from India. An account of an Indian immigrant working at a subway news-stand in New York, it was an exploration of the bleaker side of the American dream for latter-day Columbuses. She followed it up with her favourite, the documentary India Cabaret - a portrait of two strippers in Bombay with whom she lived for four months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then came fame with Salaam Bombay! - which won her an Oscar nomination and the Camera d'Or at Cannes in 1988 - and Mississippi Masala, her widely acclaimed account of a love affair between an Indian woman and a black man. Now she has done it again, seizing on the 2 000-year-old Sanskrit sex manual to produce a film challenging Indian sexual taboos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kafkaesque battle with India's censors over the film - which at one point was fought over a half-second flash of nudity - is expected to come to a climax in the Bombay High Court later this month, when Nair is suing for harassment and loss of revenue. If she wins it will go on nation- wide release and, she hopes, will teach the Indian film industry some of the joys of sex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sexuality in Indian cinema is always cloaked in rape and violence,&quot; she laments, &quot;the women as whores, or virgins, and never the twain shall meet.&quot; She blames it on a colonial heritage, of Victorian hypocrisy, compounded by Indian male defensiveness in the face of the foreigners. &quot;Male and female politics were affected - the whole notion of sharam (shame) and izzat (honour) became very important to protect their women from the men outside,&quot; Nair says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The irony is that we come from a culture which had regarded love and sexuality as a link to the divine. It was an art to be learned and yet to be completely matter-of- fact about. Kama Sutra is very straight- forward and non-didactic.  'If you wish to have sex without love, this is the art of pretence, this is how to be a courtesan. If you wish to have sex with love, then if you handle yourself in this manner there is the possibility of something sacred',&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you read any of the literature up to the 13th to 14th century there is an unabashed embrace of the erotic in a very radical way. And we have gone so far from that, not just in a repressed way, but in a twisted way. I wanted to address that. And I wanted to make a film in an ancient- modern style - not a museum piece on India, not a culturally correct work.  Just what moved me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It ended up more of a film of sexual politics than sexual positions; a game of chess between the sexes. &quot;It is essentially the journey of a woman who goes from a level of innocence to a state of person- hood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nair is jubilant about the impact the film is having. She recounts how she met an Indian woman in Trinidad who had seen the film, in a black working-class neighbourhood, and told how it became the subject of intense discussion in the community. &quot;Indian male virility has become something to contend with,&quot; Nair said with joyous peals of laughter &quot;...  in Trinidad!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - This year's Kora All-African Music Awards nominations again raise uncomfortable questions about how the industry in South Africa defines African popular music - and maybe how the world outside sees our scene. At last year's major glitzfest, South Africa was represented by, among others, Lucky Dube, who was f ted by the South African media and the organisers, and Bheki Mseleku, who was largely ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A conservative local industry preferred to hype successful pop over creative originality, although the international judging panel compensated by naming Bayete's Jabu Khanyile Best Southern African Artist.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That conservatism persists in a much more depressing South African finalists' line-up this year. In various categories, we find The Soweto String Quartet (twice), Chicco, Sabela, Mzwakhe Mbuli and Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Those names come from the record companies. They send a longer list of names plus CDs and a video to the Paris pre- selection committee.  According to organiser Suzaan Marais, a representative from Radio Metro was supposed to sit on the Paris committee, but had &quot;other commitments&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the South African names have a solid pedigree; all are accomplished performers; most sell well. And these awards are about the profitability of the industry. In his Paris speech last week, Kora's executive producer, Ernest Adjovi made the role of private enterprise and profit in cultural development a key theme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet what does the selection say about South African popular music today? These are names who had their heyday as performers in the Eighties or early Nineties, or who laboured long in the vineyard before their talent was noticed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African record companies were slow to record their output in the CD and video form that allows them to qualify for Kora. And while it would be churlish to deny them this late recognition, they do provide a predominantly backward- looking view of South Africa. Chicco's current fame, not as a performer but as a producer of Africa's most sophisticated homegrown house music, kwaito, doesn't feature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Set South Africa's nominees beside the rest of Africa and you see the problem. There's nothing as creatively innovative as Africando's village/Latin fusion; none of the contemporary social comment of Tarika or Khaled; nothing quite as rootsy as Granmoun' Lele; no virtuoso vocalist like Cesaria Evoria; no real young-generation stylist like Cheikh Lo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The selection appears to have been made by music industry executives wholly out of contact with our live performance scene. Our real innovators and virtuosi - from Phillip Tabane and Mabi Thobejane to Tananas, Robbie Jansen, M'Du, Gloria Bosman and Busi Mhlongo - are, once more, rendered invisible.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Janet Suzman's production of The Cherry Orchard, featuring an SA cast, is a huge critical success in Britain. Hazel Friedman reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is firmly rooted in South African soil. But Janet Suzman's production of Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard has received rave reviews after it opened last weekend in Britain.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The production - the Russian playwright's masterpiece on life in a run-down provincial Russian estate adapted to suit the South African situation - has been hailed by critics countrywide. Incorporating a cast of British and South African actors, the play - now showing at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre - has been described by British critics as &quot;a theatrical breakthrough&quot;, &quot;a sensitive contemporary adaptation of a classic drama&quot;, and &quot;an accurate depiction of the contradictions in post-apartheid South Africa&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is Suzman's directorial debut at the Birmingham Rep and the first play co- produced with the Market Theatre to be staged there. And it is the first predominantly South African production - six of the nine actors are South African - to have been given special permission by the normally sticky British Equity for its actors to perform in Britain. The production opens in South Africa in 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suzman first thought of staging a contemporary South African version of The Cherry Orchard seven years ago with Barney Simon, co-founder of the Market Theatre in Johannesburg. Simon - the man who is credited as being partly responsible for making the Market Theatre the unofficial national theatre of South Africa - died shortly after South Africa's 1994 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late 1995, Roger Martin, an English actor, showed Suzman his &quot;South African&quot; version of The Cherry Orchard. It is around this framework that Suzman has built her own production. Retaining the theme of the original - a psychological journey in which the characters learn painfully about relinquishing the old way of life - the play has been meticulously transposed from Tsarist Russia to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also exposes some of the most difficult issues facing the country: liberal guilt, the problem of &quot;coloureds&quot; who were not white enough for the old South Africa and are not black enough for the new, and the restoration of tribal homelands. &quot;There is no doubt that the real root of this play is in South Africa,&quot; says marketing director of the Birmingham Rep, Katie Anderson. &quot;It puts an authentic voice into the mix.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Analysts believe the new shareholding structure is a blow for black economic empowerment at JCI, reports Madeleine Wackernagel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's biggest black economic empowerment initiative is turning sour, say industry analysts. The confusion surrounding JCI's new shareholding structure is a deliberate attempt at masking the fact that real control of JCI is still largely in white hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African Mining Group (AMG), the original bidder for Anglo American's 34,9% stake, has come out with only 6,5%, indirectly through a stake in Saflife, with an option over another 4,9% to be exercised next April. Mzi Khumalo holds 34,9%, once again through Saflife, with another 6% through NK Properties (NKP), a R3-billion mining holding company headed by Brett Kebble. NKP owns 34,9% of Saflife, while Khumalo's interests hold 20% of NKP.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts question the complicated pyramid structure of this deal, suggesting a more sinister motive. &quot;This is just one paper transaction after another, and goes against all international trends of unbundling and refocusing. It looks like Kebble is trying to take control via the back door,&quot; says one analyst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Controversy has surrounded the JCI stake sale right from the beginning. First the share price at which the sale was agreed was wildly overpriced - R54,50 against a prevailing R49. It has since fallen to R38 and is now trading at R39.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then AMG couldn't raise the necessary capital, leaving Khumalo to call on Saflife, the major shareholder in his Capital Alliance Group, to find the money. The rights issues flopped, and SBC Warburg, the underwriter, is now left holding R600-million worth of shares, which will be unloaded on to various institutions, further diluting the black shareholder base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representatives of Saflife and NKP vigorously dispute this argument. Says one: &quot;AMG simply couldn't raise the necessary finance. Plus circumstances worked against them - the gold price fell, in turn pushing down the share price and consequently putting off potential investors. The reality is that there isn't that much black capital floating around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This view was echoed by a JCI insider: &quot;The fact that Khumalo and other black investors have put up so much of their own capital flies in the face of the argument that this is not a black empowerment deal. There is black capital involved; just not enough of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Khumalo and other black investors have taken a significant risk and stand to lose their shirts if the share price doesn't recover. So it's in their interests to make this deal work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But AMG members are not as easily convinced. Said one: &quot;We've worked so long and hard for this and ended up with next to nothing; it's a scandal.&quot; While another said: &quot;It is disappointing but the slump in the share price made a greater and more significant participation by black business almost impossible. Khumalo could raise the required funds through Saflife, but others didn't have the appropriate vehicle so they couldn't take part. The price was certainly too high but despite that bad price Khumalo found backing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even those in the industry who support the JCI deal concede that AMG has been marginalised, and its role reduced to a nominal one at best. The question now is what happens to the black empowerment element if the ongoing talks with Lonrho result in a merger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Selling JCI in its present state cannot be easy although the company is adamant it is developing a strategy to put it among the top mining houses in the world within the next three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The opportunities opening up are enormous,&quot; says a JCI insider. &quot;The uncertainty surrounding the shareholder structure has hampered our ability to refocus and devise new strategies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that's out of the way, we must get down to business, of which a large part is persuading investors that the group is undervalued. The intrinsic value of JCI is as good as that of our North American counterparts but our share price doesn't reflect that; we have to get that across to the market. And we can't look to the gold price alone to add value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Certainly, Khumalo is very keen to unlock the company's potential.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of going to press, Khumalo was back in London for more talks with Lonrho executives. But no decision is expected soon, say sources in London.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Grant funding will help to safeguard the flora of Table Mountain while also benefiting the community, writes Aspasia Karras</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cape Floral Kingdom project, which aims to establish a single national park of 30 000ha on the Cape Peninsula and Table Mountain, is a prime example of the new approach the World Bank is taking to environmental management. The days when it would finance large-scale projects with disastrous environmental results appear to be over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least that is what the bank's president James Wolfensohn announced at the Rio Environmental Summit this year. The bank is certainly trying to clean up its image, so much so that it has appointed a task team comprising its traditional critics to evaluate the impact of its much maligned structural-adjustment programmes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Francois Falloux, senior environmental adviser with the bank, explains that the transformation was grandiose in its execution. A small office of four fringe environmental lobbyists at the Washington head office has become a mammoth operation with more than 400 environmental specialists on tap at any given moment. They also have veto power and impose strict procedures of assessment on each project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank is currently financing environmental operations worldwide to the tune of $10-billion. In sub-Saharan Africa alone it has dedicated capacity of 70 to 80 specialists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It now runs a constantly updated watch-list of &quot;hot potatoes&quot;, including past projects that are still environmentally challenging. It seems to be getting a more positive response on this level at least. In an open letter to Wolfensohn on May 30 1997, international non-governmental organisations (NGOs) applauded the president for &quot;his vision for improving the World Bank's development effectiveness&quot;.  But they went on to say Wolfensohn had been &quot;less successful at implementing bankwide changes with respect to improving accountability, project quality, public participation and providing significant debt relief&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is no wonder, then, that the bank is making sure its interventions in the Western Cape are up to scratch. The Cape Floral Kingdom (CFK) project is about conservation, and was proposed by the National Parks Board and the World Wildlife Fund, and aims to rescue the globally significant biodiversity of the Western Cape. This is not a simple &quot;save the fynbos campaign&quot;. The scope of the project is huge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank aims to launch a major conservation initiative to create a unified management structure in the form of a national park on the Cape Peninsula, while structuring its actions to bring social benefits to the surrounding communities. The project will initially draw on a grant from the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) in the order of $10- million. The GEF was established to provide lump-sum grants to countries in support of the &quot;green and brown agenda&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Daitz, project manager for the National Parks Board, explains that only a country's government can apply for a grant by presenting a project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the rest of the global set the bank thinks that the Western Cape is a good place to put money. Deitz feels that while there is a lot of suspicion in Africa about the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, because of the conditionality attached to some projects, there is no reason to suspect this one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This funding is not a loan but a grant; the only conditionality lies in the use of the money. It comes with no strings attached. Phase one of the project involves establishing a national park on the Cape Peninsula, which will integrate the conservation of the areas under a single management authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sixty percent of the GEF funding will for the first six years be dedicated to activities integrally associated with the effective management of the park; this will only constitute 10% of project costs during these years. The success of the project team's initiatives depends on its ability to successfully integrate the 14 different management authorities into one. The most important conservation activity will be the eradication of invasive alien woody plants - the single most significant threat to the terrestrial biodiversity. These operations also offer the greatest opportunity for the delivery of social benefits to local disadvantaged communities through capacity building and job-creation programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second activity involves the Table Mountain Fund established by World Wide Fund for Nature SA, in 1993. Since inception, this fund has successfully mobilised significant private sector capital inside South Africa for the support of conservation activities in the Cape Peninsula and now more widely, in the CFK. The project plan envisages using the remaining 40% of the external funding component to top up this fund to a level where it will generate sufficient interest on an annual basis in perpetuity to support NGO and other conservation activities on the Cape Peninsula and further afield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final cluster of activities which will be undertaken during the first 18 months involves the compilation of a strategic plan for the conservation of the biodiversity of the CFK. This will require extensive mapping of the western extent of the range of the CFK where the greatest concentrations of threatened plant exist. This essential base data will be followed by extensive modelling of invasive alien plant spread, an analysis of threats and opportunities and the compilation of a strategic and financial plan to save the biodiversity of the CFK. It is an explicit intention to be in a position to mobilise additional domestic and foreign funding as soon as this activity ends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Satisfactory progress with the funding requirements will allow the project to initiate phase two of the project, intended to support activities outside the Cape Peninsula.  Falloux and the bank have a clear reason to get involved.  They see it as a win-win situation: we eradicate alien plants, restore the ecosystem, while creating opportunities for micro- enterprise, because the process is very labour intensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the long run it will consolidate international tourism.  It also helps to improve the bank's constantly wavering image in environmental circles.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Industrial participation, in the form of offset deals, is being negotiated to help strengthen South Africa's industrial base. The government wants multinationals to invest in projects that will fill the technological gaps or meet the training needs to make industry more competitive.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Offset deals for all government contracts worth more than $10-million are now obligatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin and Department of Trade and Industry industrial participation director Vassie Ponsamy last week told the parliamentary trade and industry committee they were working on 13 projects they hoped would be implemented by 2000, generating 1000 jobs directly and 500 indirectly, and $1-billion in revenue, of which $780-million would be exports and $200-million investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most advanced was a proposal from Rolls-Royce to invest $16-million in an industrial park comprising mini- factories with a central service operation that will handle shipping, financing and other commercial transactions. The factories would manufacture components that would be exported directly to Rolls-Royce. The industrial park would earn $116- million in foreign exchange over seven years. It could be built either in Atlantis, Western Cape, or at Coega, Eastern Cape. But the deal depends on whether South African Airways buys seven new Rolls-Royce-powered Boeing 777s. &quot;It all hinges on SAA, which is deciding whether it is the right time to buy,&quot; Ponsamy said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Widows of the Vaal Reefs mine locomotive accident are destitute despite compensation, reports Ferial Haffajee</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) is to claim additional compensation from Anglo American for the families of miners who died in the Vaal Reefs disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If successful, the multi-million-rand claim must be paid out by Rand Mutual, the industry insurance house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union's decision follows last year's Leon Commission of Inquiry into the 1995 accident - one of the worst in South Africa's mining history, which left 104 miners dead and scores more injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers for the NUM submitted their claim to the compensation commissioner this month. &quot;He will now decide how much extra to award,&quot; says the union's attorney Prince Mafojane. The Leon commission stated that the company and several employees had been negligent - thus paving the way for the added compensation claim.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late on the night of May 12 1995, a mine locomotive used to haul gold underground fell down a mine shaft, crushing a cage carrying the miners who were about to start the night- shift.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Workers stuck in the bottom of the double- decker cage were trapped and died there.  Many were crushed beyond recognition. The horror of the accident, the helplessness of the men and the number of dependents left destitute saw collective grief grip the land. For once, a mining accident grabbed national headlines as all the media gathered to count every dead miner brought to the surface.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The glare of publicity galvanised the industry and government into action: a victims' trust was established with Walter Sisulu and Helen Suzman at its helm. Millions of rands were poured into the fund and compensation claims were quickly settled. The trust is now concentrating on education and skills training for the dependents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years later the going is still tough for the widows and children of the miners killed at Vaal Reefs. On a visit to Mozambique to collect information to bolster their claim for added compensation, the NUM found that many families are struggling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many spent the lump-sum payments, which averaged at about R62 000 a miner, on building a house. &quot;Now many of them don't have any source of income,&quot; says NUM official Edward Ramaila, adding that the women should have been advised more wisely to make their money last longer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worse off were the contract workers who died in the accident. Because they were not employed by Anglo but by independent contractors, they were not eligible for compensation. Antonio Dangane, for example, had a wife and three children. Flora Dangane received a lump-sum payment of R2 170, while she's also entitled to a monthly pension of R1 085, but it arrives sporadically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is difficult in rural Mozambique to distinguish between general hardship in the world's poorest country and that occasioned by the deaths of those who kept the homefires burning with the earnings from South Africa's mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no infrastructure, no electricity, no water and no roads. There's not even postal delivery,&quot; says Ramaila.  The widows visit the offices of The Employment Bureau of Africa (Teba), which is responsible for paying out compensation cheques. It is an arduous undertaking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They get to Teba by borrowing money from next door. The trip can take hours,&quot; says Ramaila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To survive, many of the women travel to plots of land where they plant mitsombola, a sweet-potato-like plant and other vegetables. According to information collected by the NUM, many children do not attend school; those who do are behind for their age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While compensation pay-outs remain very low, the plight of women in polygamous marriages has been exacerbated as they have had to share compensation payment among themselves.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Even the best strategy for employment creation and poverty reduction will fail without a suitable macroeconomic framework.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An appropriate framework needs to anchor the economy's growth and development in a more equal distribution of social outputs between social classes; a developed home market with a gradual and careful approach to integration into the world economy; and an economically active government that sharply extends its provision of social services and infrastructure investment in disadvantaged communities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of an overall macroeconomic strategy, special consideration must be given to a strategy for tackling labour market constraints and developing appropriate and implementable policies for job creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the labour demand side, the strategy must encourage effective demand and in this regard pay particular attention to the expansion of the domestic market. A developed domestic market is not only a necessary condition for achieving sustainable growth, empirical studies show that more jobs are created in production for the domestic market than in production for exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incentives must be provided to employers to introduce appropriate technology to increase labour-intensive production where possible. This strategy is particularly important for domestic and even regional production to stimulate local jobs and local labour markets that directly target the unemployed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation of work is critically in need of overhaul. Employers must be actively encouraged to shift the processes of production to permit new job grading structures as well as labour-management control of work. Greater co- operation must start in the workplace wherein employees take part in decision-making, especially where it directly affects the quality of their working lives. Authoritarian control undermines workers' responsibility at work as well as their job opportunities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The government's growth strategy envisages substantial job creation but without drastic intervention the unemployment problem will not be overcome, writes Asghar Adelzadeh of the NIEP in the last in the series of articles on economic policy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two questions are fundamental to overcoming the problems of high unemployment and poverty: what are the main macro- economic and labour market factors that constrain job creation and poverty reduction, and what are the main elements of a strategy for employment creation and poverty reduction?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three broad issues come into play: the structure of the economy, the macro-economic framework and its policies, and the structure of the labour market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The structural issues constraining employment creation and poverty reduction include persistent low economic growth; high concentration of wealth and decision- making in the real and financial sectors of the economy; substantial increases in the capital-labour ratio in all sectors of the economy since the 1970s, especially in mining and manufacturing; the relatively small increase in labour productivity and, in the case of mining, relative decline; a significant decline in capital productivities in mining, manufacturing and services; a high propensity to import; an underdeveloped home market; and a lack of historical investment in human resource development and social services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These structural characteristics of South Africa's economy have directly and indirectly contributed to the overall decline in total employment, with unemployment surpassing 30% of the labour force.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Added to this is the government's macro-economic strategy and policy framework. Its fiscal austerity programme, tight monetary policy, rapid trade liberalisation approach and dual labour market policy proposals will impose further constraints on growth, job creation and poverty reduction without bringing about the necessary restructuring of the economy that will alleviate our greatest problems: job creation and poverty reduction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fiscal policy contained in the growth, employment and redistribution (Gear) strategy has already led to substantial cuts in public spending on social services and infrastructural investment, two important elements in poverty reduction and employment creation (see Business Mail, May 2 to 8). Its disinflationary tight monetary policy will continue to constrain economic growth, job creation and transformation of the financial market (see Business Mail, May 30 to June 5); its accelerated trade liberalisation proposals can potentially lead to de-industrialisation, loss of manufacturing jobs and increased dependence on imports (see Business Mail, April 4 to 10); and its labour market deregulation proposal can end the aspiration of a living wage for the majority of the population, perpetuating high inequality and low economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two-headed hydra of unemployment and underemployment is also intrinsically linked to the racial, gender and spatial inequalities, which are directly linked to the characteristics of poverty in South Africa. Notwithstanding the removal of political inequalities, the majority of South Africans continue to feel the economic inequalities in their working lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly, the current difficulties of the labour market cannot be divorced from the policies of apartheid that succeeded in dispossessing the majority black population from a self-sustaining economic base while actively undermining its ability to develop a new one. The policies of apartheid consciously created the type, structure and persistence of unemployment and underemployment that we must grapple with today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While employment creation is not solely a labour-market phenomenon, without a thorough understanding of labour-market factors that currently limit employment, sound and effective policy choices will be fleeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a basic level, the demand for labour is a positive function of the general aggregate demand for the goods and services produced in the economy. The overall stagnation of the economy since the mid- 1980s has severely undermined its ability to create jobs through growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour demand is further affected by the structure of production, which encompasses at least two crucial aspects, the production technique (the mix of capital and labour) and the organisation of work. Between 1970 and 1996, the capital- labour ratio for the economy as a whole has gradually doubled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The capitalisation of the production processes has been most dramatic in the mining sector, where capital expenditure as a unit of labour has increased by 230% in constant rand terms. The rise in the mining sector's capital-labour ratio is followed by the manufacturing sector (up 120%), services (70% up) and agriculture (30% up).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current organisation of work is part of the legacy of apartheid's job reservation laws, which created long chains of command, authoritarian control, limited opportunities for black mobility, and limited training for black workers. The consequence is the overabundance of underskilled workers for whom demand is low compared with skilled workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demand for labour also has a very regional aspect, as the largest labour-attracting centres are in metropolitan areas.  Others, like the highly capitalised mining areas, provide regional employment, while the rural areas offer fewer and less diverse employment opportunities than anywhere else in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supply of labour is another factor. In South Africa, significant differences are found in labour-force participation rates across race and gender. White participation rates are higher than those for non-whites, while female participation is significantly lower than males in all racial groups. Additionally, participation is affected by availability, quality, locality and cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Availability is largely influenced by the amount of time people spend in informal sector employment (for example domestics and hawkers). However, it is also influenced by the time spent on essential non-working activities. In the absence of infrastructural support, rural women spend a large portion of their day gathering wood and fetching water.  Consequently, they have very low participation rates in the formal labour market due parly to this &quot;time poverty&quot; phenomenon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participation in the labour market is also determined by the quality of the labour being offered. That is, education, training and skills levels are real barriers to entry in the labour market as well as to duration of labour market participation. Not surprisingly, the incidence of unemployment is skewed towards those with little formal education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Considering the lack of attention paid to education and training of the black labour force by the apartheid government and the private sector, it is not surprising that despite significant mechanisation of the production process in the past 27 years, production as a unit of capital has declined for all sectors of the economy except agriculture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spatial constraints - the disjunction between where potential workers and potential jobs are located - also affect labour force participation rates, especially of blacks and women. Internal migration from rural to urban areas as well as long-term separation and long-distance travel are vivid examples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, in addition to demand and supply factors, the institutional framework provides a backdrop upon which the labour market operates. The segmented and dual labour market is an institutional reality. The statutory and non-statutory regulation of the labour market (or absence thereof) can assist in changing (or maintaining) this reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour market regulation affects the level of unemployment as well. For example, the absence of reliable, stable and secure employment greatly affects the need for households to engage in additional activities to meet basic needs. In the absence of important employment benefits (such as health benefits) unnecessary burdens are placed on households to withstand calamity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scarcity and inadequacy of training combined with institutionalised racism creates barriers to upward mobility, thus reproducing the cycle of low-wage employment and poverty. Finally, the existence and operation of a dual labour market effectively forces many of the poorest into poverty wages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article is based on a National Institute for Economic Policy paper written by Asghar Adelzadeh and Cynthia Alvillar, a labour economist and the NUM's legal council</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - There is good news on the cards for teachers, nurses and police officers in this year's wage negotiations - they're likely to get better increases than other public sector employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the government has proposed a wage freeze for all public servants from chief director level upwards - these categories comprise 0,2% of the public service.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The largest union in the sector, the National Education Health and Allied Workers' Union (Nehawu), has said an even greater number of public servants should not get increases.  It proposed in this week's wage round that everybody from director level upwards not take increases this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government this week offered an increase averaging about 9,5%, but it works out higher for &quot;service-providers&quot; in the civil service. In effect the raise for police officers, teachers and the like works out at about 11% - an inflation- busting increase. The state has offered 20% more for the three lowest grades in the police service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major trade unions gave talks in the civil service a thumbs-up. &quot;There's a decided change in the way government presented things. There's more openness and there's a sense that government's really taking charge,&quot; said Nehawu president Vusi Nhlapo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nehawu wants a minimum wage of R2 100, while government is offering a minimum of R1 900 a month. The Public Servants Association's (PSA) representative Caspar van Rensburg said the union &quot;was not miles apart&quot; from government, though it objected to the wage freeze.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But negotiations could come unstuck on the extra amount the government has set aside for increases in savings it made from slimming down the civil service. Government says there is R323-million available in addition to the R6,5-billion budgeted for increases. The PSA says much more should have been saved.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - South Africa's leprosy hospital, which dates from the Victorian era, will close next month, writes Dawn Blalock</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monica Mazibuko, a beautiful young woman with a shy smile, sits knitting in a patch of sunshine next to her hospital bed. Though she doesn't appear sick, decades ago she would have been a virtual prisoner in this hospital and denied any contact with the outside world. Her letters would have been passed through an autoclave. At her death, she would have been buried in a lead coffin.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mazibuko is a leper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mention of leprosy evokes biblical images of disfigurement and exclusion, not the afflictions of a woman like Mazibuko, a 29-year-old waitress from Mpumalanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first bacterium ever identified is by no means dead.  There are an estimated two million lepers in the world.  According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), leprosy is &quot;an insidious, slowly developing disease&quot;, which still flourishes in the globe's poverty belt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leprosy lore is rife with myths. To answer a few: leprosy is not a skin disease, it's not very contagious, it will not make limbs fall off and, most importantly, it's curable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In basic lay terms, leprosy is a bacillus, which is keen on the human nervous system. It spreads like a cold, but a cold that takes three to five years for the symptoms to show up. As it attacks the nerves, the sufferer gradually loses sensation. At first one would just feel a few numb patches on the arms or the face. Treated then, with a multiple-drug therapy cocktail, it's easily and cheaply curable in about six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Left alone, however, the patient's immune system responds to the bug and causes irreparable nerve damage. The first symptoms are skin lesions and numb patches. As sufferers completely lose sensation, their faces become flaccid, eyes don't blink and they can eventually go blind. Hands and feet curl into gnarled claws and become senseless. Since they feel no pain, they unknowingly and constantly injure themselves.  Their bones fracture microscopically, and fragment over many years. Bit by bit, battered and broken fingers and toes are &quot;re-absorbed&quot; into the body, giving the impression that they have fallen off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lepers, using railway vouchers issued to them by health services, make the trek from all over the country to the West Fort Hospital leprosy clinic outside Pretoria where Mazibuko is a patient. Dr Mari' Beyers, the clinic's only doctor, lives on the grounds of the Victorian-era hospital where she has worked for seven years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She points out a wheelchair-bound old man, his nose and facial features sunken into his face, and much of his legs missing. She takes a stump that used to be his hand and runs her fingers along it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;See that there,&quot; she says, pointing out a small protrusion where one would expect to see a pinkie finger.  &quot;That's actually his fingernail. His body has re-absorbed his fingers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leprosy clinic will close next month as part of the government's plan to decentralise the health-care system. The 125-year-old hospital is outdated, both physically and in its way of treating people, the Health Department says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;ostrich&quot; mentality of a bygone era when lepers were locked away from the rest of society is no longer tenable, says Dr Adriaan Myburgh, a representative of the Gauteng Department of Health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You take all the lepers out of the community and hide them behind big walls and say we don't have a problem with leprosy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not everyone exposed to the disease will become lepers: it is impossible to contract leprosy without a genetically determined immune deficiency. &quot;Most people are completely unaware of the fact that it's not very contagious,&quot; says Myburgh. Many nurses being trained to treat the disease in community clinics said their knowledge of it came from what they had read in the Bible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leprosy cases have been declining in South Africa, but officials expect a slight increase as immigrants from neighbouring countries plagued by war and instability such as Zaire and Mozambique bring it with them across the borders.  These countries are among the 10 that have the most cases of leprosy internationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though it's now scientifically possible, complete eradication of one of the world's most ancient diseases is not likely any time soon. According to a WHO report on leprosy, the disease is not a priority. Aids, other more deadly tropical diseases, poor health infrastructure, wars and social instability &quot;make leprosy elimination seem like a luxury, an impracticable one at that&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - What are the prospects for the ban on the trade in ivory from the African elephant being lifted at next month's Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prospects would seem to rest on the following possibilities: a majority of African states and other parties to the convention agreeing that the ban should be lifted; whether the convention can agree on split-listing of elephant groups; the major consumer countries entering reservations against the ban; and most of all, whether North American and European animal rights groups feel that the world should officially resume trade in ivory again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently most African states and other parties to the convention are still opposed to lifting the ban. Fears about the slaughter of elephants for ivory have been intensified by the discovery last year of more than 250 elephants massacred in the northern part of the Congo, whose tusks had been removed. It is feared that people have started collecting ivory in anticipation of the ban being lifted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Split-listing of elephant groups, into appendix II for those from Southern African countries proposing lifting the ban, and appendix I for the rest, is not likely to receive much sympathy, as the reason it was previously rejected (the problem of distinguishing between legal and illegal ivory) is still valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report of the panel of experts sent to investigate the population status, enforcement capabilities and trade controls of the three countries proposing lifting the ban does not augur well for the prospects either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The panel's report on Zimbabwe states that ivory shipments totalling as much as 10 tons had been illegally exported from Zimbabwe in 1996. There is doubt, therefore, whether customs arrangements in these countries would be adequate to control the illegal traffic in ivory. The United States and Japan were the major consumer countries until the ban. Apparently both governments sympathise with the position of the Southern African states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if this is true, it is doubtful whether the two governments would be willing openly to support lifting the ban. For one thing, the price of ivory products in the West has apparently decreased precipitously in recent years due to changing values. Western countries have no domestic reason, therefore, to resume the importation of ivory. In fact, they are under pressure from animal rights groups to maintain the ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The price for taking on animal rights groups can be very high, because of these groups' influence on public opinion.  Western governments thus tend to be wary of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Japan especially has been fighting a bruising battle since 1982, without much success, to have the moratorium on whaling lifted. Its principal opponents have been the same Western animal rights groups that are ardent supporters of the ivory trade ban. It is unlikely that Japan would want to risk opening another battle-front on the ivory issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western governments are unlikely to risk losing political capital over the ivory issue. The balance of power seems to be with animal rights and environmental groups. In developed countries, environmental awareness has become a major concern in public life. Driving this change in perception are many ardent, committed, direct action environmental groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On issues which the groups feel strongly about, they can be adamant and intolerant. They are usually willing to take any action to reach their goal. They lobby to change the positions of their governments. They do not trust governments to do the right thing alone. Thus they take direct action with foreign governments, non-governmental organisations, corporations, individual citizens and by attending the conventions and actively lobbying the delegates. To them, killing elephants is a moral issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It cannot be economically or scientifically justified.  Allied to the African range states opposing the lifting of the ban are a coalition of US and European animal rights and environmental groups called the &quot;species survival network&quot;, who have so far persuaded the convention parties that the conditions for lifting the ban have not yet been met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his latest book on the subject, John Hoyt, president of Humane Society International, concludes that &quot;after all that has happened to the elephant, the ivory trade must be kept closed no matter what the cost&quot;. If his views are anything to go by, then the Southern African states fighting to have the ban lifted face a daunting task.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Yunus Carrim, an ANC MP in the National Assembly, jumps into the debate on Africanism which has recently surfaced again</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current debates about &quot;Africanism&quot; in the African National Congress cannot be separated from wider debates about the &quot;national question&quot; in South Africa today. And debates about the &quot;national question&quot; are crucially linked to debates about the nature of our overall transition; the one mirrors the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What does non-racialism mean in practice today? What is the value of the notion of a &quot;rainbow nation&quot;? How do class and gender relate to nation-building? How does affirmative action fit into nation- building?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what senses is it still useful to link coloureds and Indians with Africans collectively as &quot;blacks&quot;, and in what senses is it useful to understand coloureds and Indians as &quot;minorities&quot;? How does provincialism impact on nation- building? What about the increasing xenophobia among South Africans?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These questions are being addressed against a background of understanding that the ethnic and racial identities of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the apartheid era cannot be attributed solely to the state's social engineering</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and that their resilience in new forms poses enormous challenges to the emergence of a broader South African national identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the ANC's &quot;broad church&quot; character - including its range of ethnic, racial and class groupings, and differences in historical tradition - it is inevitable that there will be differences on the nature of the national question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also understandable, in view of the legacy of the past and complexities of the present, that competition for positions, turf, material reward and hegemony of ideas will also, at times, assume ethnic and racial forms. Can one expect otherwise?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within the ANC there are both abstract non-racialists who do not sufficiently acknowledge cultural identities, and those who tend to over-emphasise these identities. In between is a middle ground that seeks to ask: how can we provide space for the expression of people's multiple identities in a way that fosters national unity?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of this approach there is nothing inherently conflictual between asserting African leadership and non- racialism. And while affirmative action is for all blacks, since Africans constitute the vast majority and are, in general, the most deprived, it is inevitably mainly Africans who will be its prime beneficiaries - in a way that also includes poor coloureds and Indians, and eventually whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is recognised that ultimately affirmative action is not about race, but about need - and the rich of whatever colour will have to contribute to the development of the poor, regardless of colour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the nation-building process must reflect the culture, values and interests of all our people, it must, in the long term, reflect primarily that of the African working class and its allies - in a way that provides space for the expression of a multiplicity of identities that are reconcilable with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this context, to focus on the numbers of non-Africans in leadership positions in the ANC, the government and other areas of society is useful but not enough. It can be misleading. Non-Africans are prominent in the ANC and government, not dominant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This prominence is transitory. Most non-Africans serve primarily African constituencies. Those in key leadership positions are often there because of their contribution to the struggle as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, Minister of Communications Jay Naidoo emerges from a trade union background and Minister of Transport Mac Maharaj from the armed and underground political struggles.  They are not specifically representing the Indian community of Chatsworth. (This does not mean that they should not do more to win this community over to the ANC.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not just a question of focusing on the racial composition of ANC MPs, but more fundamentally, the direct accountability of MPs to voters. Through multi-party consensus, an appropriate combination of a constituency and list system of elections can, in future, be devised that will partly address any undue racial and ethnic imbalances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, the legitimate concerns of those identified as Africanists can be addressed without challenging the ANC's non-racialism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An approach that emphasises mainly African and working- class leadership and content to nation-building can serve to enrich non- racialism, and has to be distinguished from a narrow exclusivist Africanism that does not serve the cause of fundamental transformation in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even this latter approach, fuelled by the limited pace of the transition, is a legitimate current within the ANC. It must be engaged with, rather than denied. The answer to it is certainly not an abstract non-racialism that obscures the racial and class realities of the present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national question must rather be given a content that serves to transform South Africa in the interests of primarily the poor and disadvantaged, of all South Africans.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The decision by the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) to clear the way for a Nigerian military invasion of Sierra Leone is like seconding the Mafia to raid dope smokers at a high school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria's corrupt and brutal military regime has had an enormous destabilising role in West Africa. Ordinary Liberians and Sierra Leoneans blame the Nigerian military junta and its ambitions for hegemony in West Africa for assisting the warlords and 20-something military captains in the ruination of their countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The popularity of the Nigerian military did not improve when they shelled Freetown from a gunboat last week. Nor did their generally inept performance, resulting in the capture of hundreds of Nigerian troops, inspire confidence. Ecowas - the Nigerian- controlled West African &quot;peace-keeping&quot; force that the OAU is relying on to restore stability - has been an unmitigated disaster in whichever unfortunate country it has been imposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African decision to back the OAU position, presumably in the interests of a phoney African solidarity, is as short-sighted as those nations that sought to reward Zairean dictator Mobuto Sese Seko in 1994 for providing refugee camps for Hutus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the OAU was really serious about standing up to the forces that impede democracy on the continent - as that great democrat and now OAU chairman Robert Mugabe claims it is - it should be assembling an intervention force to go into Nigeria and overthrow Sani Abacha who illegally came to power in a coup in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It should be lobbying for the accession to power of Moshood Abiola, whose election victory in 1992 was suspended by the military, and who languishes in prison. It should go for the big guys because, as in the case of Mobutu, they have the capacity to corrupt entire regions. But there is not a whisper even about economic sanctions against Abacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is because restoring democracy is not what this &quot;trade union of criminals&quot; - as Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni described them so succinctly last week - is seeking to achieve. Many of the current OAU leaders themselves came to power through military coups. The principle involved is not preventing military take-overs, but self- preservation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again South Africa, one of the few members of the club that has real democratic credentials, has flunked the test of leadership. We should not be party to this farce.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - FW De Klerk has obviously decided his golf game is more important than his place in history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How else does one explain the desertion of the political wisdom that was so manifest on February 2 1990, when he seemed to have the world at his feet?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surely this petty politician railing against the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is not a Nobel Peace Prize laureate? With each whining attempt to evade responsibility for the appalling history of his party, De Klerk grows more and more diminished, a sad figure out of touch with his country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth commission's mandate comes from Parliament, where the National Party helped draft and ratify the legislation that gave it birth. And now that the commission does precisely what it was created to do - drill De Klerk on his culpability as apartheid's last president - he bleats that the body is biased towards the African National Congress and demands an apology from it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite being confronted with State Security Council minutes at the commission's political party hearings, De Klerk continued to refuse to take responsibility for human rights abuses committed by his former security forces. Faced with this amnesiac and stubborn response from a lifelong member of the party that brought such misery, mayhem and murder to this country, it is perfectly understandable that even the oft-forgiving commission chair Desmond Tutu would lose his cool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Klerk appears to be trapped in a lie. He began rewriting history in the run-up to the 1994 elections, claiming that he had personally liberated South Africa from apartheid. And he has consistently stuck to this story ever since, abrogating all responsibility for the atrocities committed by the NP before and after 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His real problem is that to the vast majority of South Africans the NP is synonomous with a racist and murderous system. Each week the revelations at the truth commission drive this home. The NP's response - a transparent state of denial - shows the party is an anachronism. Judging by the numbers of supporters and office- bearers deserting the sinking ship and following Roelf Meyer out of the party, this view is shared by many of those who supported De Klerk in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NP failed in government and now they are failing in opposition. Its only logical path is to disband. Unable to face up to the past, it has no future. The sooner it makes way for a real opposition, the better the prospects for real democracy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Toil and trouble in the cauldron of the University of the North. Ann Eveleth reports on the issues</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University of the North students returned to classes last week after a three-week boycott over an issue directly affecting about 300 of the 14 500 students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a tangled web of conflicting views over transformation remains - and further conflict looms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transformation may mean different things to different people, but a common goal in South Africa is the reform of apartheid-era institutions to reflect democracy and non- racialism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the road to transformation has been turbulent for the University of the North, it is not alone: other campuses, including Wits, the University of Durban-Westville, the University of Cape Town, Fort Hare and many others are, or have been, experiencing similar problems.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the University of the North, discord between students and the management of vice-chancellor Njabulo Ndebele - who lost out in last year's contest to lead Wits - over the withdrawal of a Higher Education Diploma course for students still completing their primary degrees has been brewing for some time. Last month this relatively minor dispute mushroomed into full-scale confrontation complete with demonstrations, sit-ins and suspensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminal charges are threatened against the strike's alleged &quot;ringleaders&quot;, and relations between management and most of the campus's constituencies are in a shambles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shutdown was the second incident this year in which Turfloop campus - once at the forefront of transformation in university education - has been brought to a halt by a relatively minor issue. In February, the dispute was about financial exclusions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students have lost more than five weeks of instruction in the first five months of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four issues are behind the dispute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Transformation: Students and the Broad Transformation Committee (BTC) - now generally known as Broad Transformation Forums - accuse Ndebele of stalling transformation. This is at the heart of the troubles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February, the committee ousted Ndebele as its convenor, claiming he failed to call meetings and relied instead on the senate - a body they say is dominated by &quot;old-guard academics&quot; and whose powers are inflated by the 1969 Act still governing the university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we talk about transformation, management tries to stall things on the grounds of this 1969 Act,&quot; says Students' Representative Council (SRC) president Gilbert Kganyago. &quot;The first thing that needs to happen is the democratisation of structures of governance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That started in 1991 when the university led the country in forming its BTC, which in 1992 appointed a new council. In 1993, there was wide involvement, albeit not agreement, in Ndebele's selection. However, the committee has now set its sights on the senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndebele denies the senate is conservative: &quot;Significant numbers of senate members are committed to this institution and to transformation. The senate composition does need to change, but this can only be done when the Act is amended.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndebele, who also leads the Committee of University Principals, says he supports government recommendations on Broad Transformation Forums, but warns they are not a substitute for &quot;professional leadership&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says: &quot;The BTC is only an advisory body. It is not a statutory body on academic matters - these decisions still belong to the faculty boards and the senate and the management must be allowed to manage the university.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BTC convenor Arnold Msimeki disagrees: &quot;It appears the senate is dragged in when council takes a decision that is not favoured by management. We still need to transform governing structures from the top.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The BTC should lead this transformation. It should be a policy-formulation body, a troubleshooter and a forum for reconciliation between different constituencies. The BTC is the university Parliament where all stakeholders can speak to one another.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Curriculum: The next issue likely to inflame the transformation debate is the long-awaited curriculum reform.  Students say this should reflect the &quot;new national ethos&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should be involved in discussions on what kind of courses we want to take, what kind of material we want to learn and even how many lecture rooms we have,&quot; says SRC secretary general Ishmail Malale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndebele agrees the curriculum &quot;needs to be totally revamped&quot;, discussions are already taking place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he and senior academics might again anger students and the BTC. &quot;Stakeholders will have ample opportunity to interject their views when the recommendations are fed back into the faculties,&quot; says Ndebele, but argues that this responsibility lies with the faculty boards and the senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After (proposals) are drawn up there would be no harm in asking for the views of the BTC, but decisions like how many lecture halls to have require a high degree of professionalism. I doubt that any of the students has the capacity to take such decisions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Staff: The BTC traces the lag in curriculum development to another simmering conflict - between management, the senate and the Concerned Lecturers and Academic Support Services Group. This group of junior lecturers claims to carry more than its share of academic responsibilities, but lacks recognition or senate representation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a tendency to ignore that this campus was created to produce people to run the bantustans,&quot; Msimeki says. &quot;Most of the course offerings are from the old order and the people who are supposed to lead the curriculum changes - the doctors and professors - are just not there. It is their juniors coming up who are pushing for transformation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group's vice-chair Tsitso Moalusi, a junior industrial psychology lecturer, says its demands centre on staff development, senate representation and faster transformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although we are called junior lecturers, many of us have higher qualifications than those who are called senior lecturers. We teach most of the classes, and while the professors are supposed to mentor junior lecturers, masters and PhD students and publish articles, they do very little of it,&quot; says Moalusi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndebele concedes the mentoring process has fallen behind, but blames this - and many other campus shortcomings - on lack of capacity. &quot;We have changed the promotion requirements so it is virtually impossible to get promoted without proving you have done mentoring, but our departments still lack the capacity to monitor the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the old system, many of the basic procedures and processes of the university came to a halt, so we are virtually rebuilding a university from nothing. That's why transformation is such a long process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Higher Education Diploma: The diploma saga demonstrates the practical level on which these ideological differences play out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndebele says the senate resolved in 1995 to drop the diploma course for non-graduate students, because: &quot;The students couldn't cope. Only 40% were passing and there were logistical problems around scheduling. The SRC agreed to this decision in 1995, but this year the SRC has been campaigning for the students to be registered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the SRC's Malale says the diploma issue is hardest on poor students with one degree course to complete: &quot;We come from working- class backgrounds and we cannot afford to study for a whole year if we're not taking a full load.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The matter is still unresolved: though the council last week overruled the senate's refusal to allow students to register for the course, a senate meeting this week asked the council to reconsider its position. If the council agrees, the issue will go back to square one with possible implications for further conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The BTC feels the diploma issue is not a matter that should have brought the university to a halt if proper lines of communication were open ... It just shows we have a long way to go to transform this university,&quot; says the BTC's Msimeki.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kinshasa - Breakfasts will never be the same at Kinshasa's Intercontinental hotel. First the rebels' arrival heralded the end of the almond croissants. Then came the business with the grenade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just about the only person not disturbed by the little metal ball clattering on to the tiled floor and wandering its way laboriously under the breakfast tables was the young soldier who dropped it. The sun was just up and he was more interested in opening his first beer of the day.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regular clientele of local businessmen and foreign diplomats sat frozen and incredulous until their liberator finally slouched his way over to recover his misplaced explosive and made off to blitz the buffet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the leaders of the revolution which revived Zaire as the re-christened Congo are now basking in Kinshasa's top hotel. With them have come young soldiers from the rural interior who have seen nothing like it. And, for all the decrepit state of Mobutu Sese Seko's defeated troops, the hotel has never seen anything quite like their conquerors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One regular guest at the breakfast table specialises in the Mexican bandit look, with wads of ammunition strung across his chest while humping a machine-gun almost as tall as himself which he refuses to let go of, even as he loads up his bowl with tinned fruit. It could wipe out most of the clientele in a matter of seconds. They tend to wait their turn at a distance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laden under an array of weaponry, rebels wander around the lobby wide-eyed at the fine suits and electronic gadgets decorating the opulent shops. The lifts are a particular source of fascination and confusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prostitutes have left some rebels close to apoplectic at the sight of mini-skirts and make-up - so much so that soldiers in other parts of Kinshasa have ordered women in short skirts or trousers to strip before burning the offending articles and giving the distressed victims stern lectures on African morality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Inter&quot; - as the hotel is universally known in Kinshasa - had not filled more than a few dozen rooms at a time in years. It used to be the most profitable in the international hotel chain, but business dropped off with Zaire's economic collapse about the same time the company spent millions on a new tower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The end of the war has brought a new boom, if filling the hundreds of rooms is what matters. Quite who is paying is something else. Half the hotel is owned by the government, which used to mean Mobutu. His much-despised son, Kongulu - nicknamed &quot;Saddam Hussein&quot; for his ruthlessness - found it a favourite hangout for entertaining whoever took his fancy at someone else's cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The encounters were not always happy. The previous manager, a German, was pursued by a gun-waving Mobutu junior when the casino refused to accept a freshly printed batch of worthless money. The manager had to spend the night hiding in an empty room. The hotel nightclub was closed after one of Kongulu's friends shot at the barman and drunkenly missed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kongulu's final visit to the Inter began at 3am the morning the rebels moved into Kinshasa. He jumped from an armoured car and stormed into the hotel with a group of soldiers in search of an errant army captain and the prime minister's family to settle old scores. He found neither, and a few hours later bolted across the river to Brazzaville. He left behind a $1-million hotel bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hotel's Palestinian-Jordanian manager is uncertain if the new order is any more creditworthy as it does its best to compete with Kongulu's spending. The rebels even got the hotel to arrange Laurent Kabila's inauguration last week, in the absence of anyone in Kinshasa with recent first-hand experience of swearing in presidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Inter may come to regret its breakfast buffet in particular. After ordering their first beers, soldiers sweep the platters clean before making full use of the numerous baggy pockets on their uniforms to stock up for the rest of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside, a growing crowd of Kinshasans makes its way to the hotel each morning to offer invaluable advice to the new regime on how the country should be run. Young men carrying the ubiquitous briefcases which signal self-declared membership of the &quot;intellectual class&quot; are often offended to discover Kabila can do without them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security outside the hotel is tight, if you don't have a gun. While men dripping in weapons wander in and out unhindered, everyone else is searched, with the exception of some of Mobutu's former associates. The security guards are having a hard time shedding old habits, so they dutifully salute and wave them through the doors untroubled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the bar toilets overflowed, the plumbers discovered they were blocked with ripped-up documents discarded by a few of the deposed despot's cronies who stayed on in the hope of finding a role in the new regime. One of Mobutu's generals is living in the hotel, hoping to ingratiate himself. It is not clear if he has been successful or is on his way to a prison cell.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Ministry of Defence has been asked to stop cutting jobs, reports Rehana Rossouw</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliament has asked the Ministry of Defence to freeze its job-cutting until plans are in place to prevent thousands of unemployed troops being forced on to the streets and into crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) has already warned that close to 6 000 personnel could go this year, following hefty cuts in defence spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The axe will fall on troops on short-term contracts - those employed for less than four years -which means none is entitled to the cushion of retrenchment packages.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, hundreds of young men trained in the use of arms during the struggle against apartheid - especially members of former self-defence units - are said to have swelled the ranks of South Africa's crime syndicates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chair of Parliament's portfolio committee on defence, Tony Yengeni, said this week the committee wants a strategy to ease the hardship of unemployment, and to calm fears that those axed will gravitate to crime when their paypackets stop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have asked the Department of Defence to stop interfering with people on two-year short-term contracts until a clear and agreed policy of rationalisation is in place,&quot; Yengeni said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unless we have clear guidelines, we are all going to suffer the consequences of abruptly severing them from the SANDF.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yengeni said the committee is also concerned that the burden of the staff cuts would fall primarily on people on short- term contracts, many of whom are members of non- statutory armed forces - Umkhonto weSizwe (MK) and the Azanian People's Liberation Army (Apla).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defence budget was slashed by a further R700-million in February - an unplanned cut which took the total cut in the 1996/97 allocation to R1,47-billion. This has forced the Defence Ministry to review personnel numbers and planned military hardware acquisitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Figures provided by the SANDF this week show that of the 27 198 soldiers on two- year contracts, 11 745 are members or former members of MK and Apla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A defence representative said those on such contracts had less than seven years' experience in their former armed forces and were younger than 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The maximum term of service in this system is six years.  But most soldiers are put on medium-term contracts after the short-term contracts expire, in which they serve between five and 10 years in the SANDF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yengeni said the staff cuts have to start soon, and the defence committee is hoping to work out severance guidelines within the next month.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Jonathan Paton, son of the writer Alan Paton, is unhappy with aspects of a television series about his father. The Principal, the story of the author's years as a warden at Diepkloof Reformatory, is currently airing on SABC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Paton junior has also received retractions from the Mail &amp; Guardian and the Sunday Times for unfounded rumours in these newspapers in reviews of the programme.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My father's history,&quot; he says, &quot;is like public property.  I'm around, my brother's around but no one seems to bother consulting us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is fairly impressed by the outward qualities of the TV show: &quot;I think it's very well mounted.&quot; But his quarrel is the portrayal of his parents: &quot;The characters are fanciful creatures, not the parents I recognise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a common qualm about biographies of the writer's life. When Australian Peter Alexander penned his warts-and- all Paton biography, the publishers, Oxford University Press, selected the most salacious parts of the book for their press release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I remember seeing a British tabloid that had picked up on the press release with the headlines 'Sex, Adultery and Violence in a haunted liberal soul',&quot; says Paton, who is a Wits University English lecturer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes The Principal's problem is that writer/director Roy Sargeant integrated several of Paton's short stories with elements of Alexander's biography - based on third-hand accounts of Paton's wife, Dorrie. &quot;She comes across as frigid, which she never was. She was very outgoing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other inaccuracies, he says, include scenes where his father is seen swearing, drinking whisky and smoking. &quot;My father came from a very restricted family and he took a long time to rebel against it. He never swore. In the series he says 'bastard' and 'bullshit' ... the most he would drink in his early days was a ginger square yet they have him swigging down scotch ... they also have him smoking a cigarette like it's a Gunston ad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another moment that irks is a scene where the mother of an inmate is invited to dinner at the Paton's home, notices a serviette ring with the initial B on it, and discovers it stands for Dorrie's late first husband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paton junior says he actually discovered the serviette ring when he was 32 - the first time he knew that his mother had married before. &quot;The important thing is that my parents suppressed the whole thing. To have it exposed so early in the story is to take things completely out of context. The artistic licence they've taken is personally very irritating.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An incident where Paton allegedly tried to pick up a black prostitute remains shrouded in speculation. (Paton was mugged late at night by a hitchhiker who alleged that he had been asked to procure the services of a woman.) The Sunday Times magazine recently reported that Paton had &quot;a penchant for black prostitutes&quot; - a claim the paper has since retracted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe the incident was true, we'll never know. But to say 'penchant' implies he was out looking for black women every other week,&quot; Paton says. &quot;I'm really rather tired of the Paton industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Experts say new bail laws will paper over the cracks, writes Marion Edmunds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government is promising stricter bail laws - despite little evidence that current laws are at fault. Legal experts argue that the decision will merely paper over failures in the criminal justice system and the bad decisions of inexperienced magistrates. They also warn that it might infringe human rights.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Minister Dullah Omar was this week unable to provide any direct research to prove that the law was at fault - when the accused in serious cases obtained bail easily - rather than the officers of the criminal justice system. Nor was he able to pinpoint the legal loopholes through which accused are apparently escaping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The current law is working well and in the main is adequate, but for whatever reason, there are cases of extreme instances where people are granted bail in circumstances where it should not have been granted,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amendments - which Omar flagged in Parliament last week - will make it difficult for anybody accused of serious offences such as rape, murder, drug-dealing and car-hijacking to get bail at all. It is also expected that night courts will be stopped, so that bail cannot be applied for after hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lack of research about the effectiveness of these measures appears to confirm the fears of human rights organisations that the amendments have been made to appease the public and pre- empt criticism from opposition parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Human Rights Commission believes the current law is more than adequate and the debate around legal amendments only shifts attention away from the real problems on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we amend bail laws tomorrow, the inefficient system will throw up a host of new problems in two months' time. We can't carry on amending laws to deal with structural inefficiencies,&quot; said commissioner Jody Kollapen this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the bail law was tightened in 1995, the number of awaiting-trial prisoners has increased by 50%, indicating that the law is putting enormous pressure on the prison system. A quarter of all prisoners are awaiting trial.  Correctional Services cannot cope with greater numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most commentators agree that neither magistrates nor prosecutors are adequately trained in existing bail laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a pilot project by a New York organisation, Vera, and the Justice Department, will create the position of bail officer in the Mitchells Plain and Johannesburg magistrates' courts. The officer will interview accused, take photographs for the record, brief the court, watch possible witness intimidation and monitor compliance with bail conditions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luanda - As the peace process drags on, the overthrow of Mobutu has handed the government in Luanda an opportunity to move in on Unita's rich diamond fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Fortnight of fighting in Angola's diamond-rich, north- eastern province of Lunda Norte has raised renewed doubts about the stability of the peace-keeping process - just two months before United Nations peacekeeping troops are due to complete their withdrawal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Angolan armed forces (FAA), using the town of Dundo as a base, have pushed into territory held by the former rebel Unita movement. Although the UN has been denied access to the area, about 2 500 people have fled into government-held towns, and local residents report mortar and Katyusha rocket fire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also reports of dead and wounded FAA soldiers being brought back to Dundo. &quot;This is the worst fighting since the 1994 Lusaka peace accord,&quot; says one diplomat in the capital Luanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unita has complained to the UN about what it describes as government aggression, and a Unita representative in Luanda has warned that the former rebels &quot;will take appropriate measures if the offensive continues&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite much bluster, Unita has decided to live with its losses around Dundo, knowing that in its present weakened condition it can scarcely risk a return to all-out conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The diamond reserves of Lunda Norte are an essential source of income to Unita, worth an estimated $500-million a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while diamond experts say that the recent fighting may have cost Unita between 10 to 15% of that total, the richest mining areas remain firmly under the movement's control.  These areas are in the Cuango valley, further to the west, where Unita claims there has been a build-up of FAA military strength in recent weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government officials deny a decision has been taken to remove forcibly Unita from the areas it controls. They claim instead that the operation is designed to secure the northern border with the Democratic Republic of Congo, snaring troops loyal to ousted Mobuto Seke Seko who are trying to flee the forces of Laurent Kabila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the fighting around Dundo reflects the government's increasing lack of tolerance with what it perceives as foot- dragging by the Unita leader, Jonas Savimbi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the root of this impatience is the fact that Unita still controls about 70% of Angolan territory. At the beginning of April, Unita accepted a junior role in a power- sharing Government of Unity and National Reconciliation, still dominated by the ruling MPLA party, but there has been little progress since then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But events in Congo confirm Unita's growing international isolation, and may now encourage the government to take a more bellicose attitude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten years ago Unita had important friends in Washington, Pretoria and Kinshasa; now it is distinctly unpopular in all three of those capitals. &quot;With the fall of President Mobutu, Unita have lost their last important foreign friend,&quot; says Angola's Deputy Foreign Minister Jorge Chikoti.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu was indeed a vital ally to Savimbi, allowing him to send out diamonds through Zaire, while bringing in weapons and fuel, in clear violation of UN sanctions. In contrast, Kabila is a close ally of the Angolan government, which provided support to him during the Zairean civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the assistance of Lebanese traders, Unita will doubtless continue exporting diamonds from its airfields across Angola, but the scale of the trade is likely to be severely curtailed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, speculation is growing of a split between Unita moderates who have already arrived in Luanda, and those hardline generals who remain with Savimbi in his central highlands headquarters of Bailundo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those who are in Luanda are seeing they can work with their MPLA counterparts and the idea of returning to the bush becomes less and less attractive,&quot; says one diplomat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The differences of opinion within Unita were graphically illustrated in an ugly incident last week in the central province of Kwanza Sul, when a gang of Unita supporters beat up and nearly killed a leading Unita moderate, Isaias Samakuva. He says he believes the attack was carried out by local hotheads, but his interpretation sits oddly with Unita's reputation for discipline and centralised decision- making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN and Western diplomats are now urging Savimbi finally to embrace the peace process, and move to Luanda. Until now, he has refused to do so, arguing that his personal safety cannot be guaranteed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But these are critical times for the man who launched Unita back in 1966. &quot;If he comes to Luanda, he plays his last card, but if he stays in Bailundo, he risks seeing his authority gradually being eroded,&quot; says one government minister.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - A witness this week told the Zambian Supreme Court that presidential security personnel threatened to shoot her if she told anyone she had known President Frederick Chiluba by a different name 30 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anna Chilekwa, a 52-year-old widow, told the court she was driven from Lusaka to Luanshya by Simon Mumba, in the company of two other State House security men. At Luanshya, she said Mumba told her: &quot;They know your place now. These are the president's people, they will just come and shoot you.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chilekwa testified she had known Chiluba in 1955 as Titus Mpundu. She said Chiluba's family and hers were neighbours.  On the origin of Chiluba's father, she said: &quot;Jim Zherare Nkhonde never used to hide his origins. He used to say he came from Mozambique.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Constitution, a person of foreign parentage cannot be state president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chilekwa said that in those days, Chiluba fancied people calling him &quot;Titus Mpundu Zherare Nkhonde as he wanted people to know he was the son of the famous herbalist&quot;. She did not see him after 1960 for 25 years. By then he had dropped his childhood name, for unexplained reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her evidence contradicts that of an earlier witness, Luka Chabala Kafupi, who claims to be Chiluba's real father and who offered body samples for a secret DNA test carried out in unnamed laboratories in Johannesburg and London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafupi told the supreme court that he made Chiluba's mother, Daina Kaimbe, pregnant, but her relatives had rejected marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sakwiba Sikota, one of the six lawyers for the petitioners, said they were using this testimony to seal a possible loophole should the supreme court decide that for legal purposes Nkhonde was Chiluba's father. This possibility is real: in Chiluba's election nomination papers last year he named his father as Jim Nkhonde Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, a European human rights body wrote to the supreme court saying the Zambian government intends to interfere with the petitioners' case against Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the state-owned Times of Zambia newspaper, Guslavo Joaquin, president of Human Rights in Germany, sent a fax to each of the seven judges urging them to resist government interference. The supreme court has not released the fax. Phillip Musonda, acting chief administrator of the Zambian judiciary, has written to Joaquin saying the faxed letter amounted to contempt of the supreme court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fax comes hard on the heels of an election monitoring report compiled by the National Committee for Clean Campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report says prior to Chiluba becoming president the judiciary exhibited hard- edged independence. But &quot;after five years of democracy, the judiciary seems to be losing credibility. Members of the public and opposition political parties seem to have lost faith in the judiciary.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Peace moves are being likened to the secret negotiations between the NP and ANC, write Eddie Koch and Enoch Mthembu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slowly, agonisingly, Kwa-Zulu-Natal may be heading for peace. The most recent sign that centripetal forces are beginning to dominate the politics of South Africa's most turbulent region was a report this week that Mangosuthu Buthelezi was willing to entertain a merger with his arch- enemies in the African National Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unity between the rival nationalist movements in KwaZulu- Natal &quot;would be an ideal thing&quot;, Buthelezi was quoted as saying in the Sunday Times. &quot;I do not see why it should not happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The front-page story was followed by a flurry of &quot;corrections and clarifications&quot;. Lasting peace in the province would depend on the ANC recognising the &quot;paramount role&quot; of the Inkatha Freedom Party, said Buthelezi in a statement the next day. The ANC had to &quot;take into account that our kingdom of KwaZulu-Natal had to be recognised&quot;, he added.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traditional leaders still want to discuss a range of grievances about their &quot;maltreatment&quot; at the hands of the central government. The question of amnesty for warlords on both sides is still unresolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, significantly, the hardline IFP leader did not deny he had spoken positively about the possibility of a merger. A powerful caucus from each of the rival political parties, led by IFP Premier Ben Ngubane and ANC provincial leader Jacob Zuma, has been meeting behind closed doors for nearly a year to discuss a peace pact for the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the last round took place three weeks ago, all the participants knew the attitude of the Inkatha leader, who has consistently defied efforts by the ANC's centrists to cultivate support from moderates in his party, was critical for success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A quick trip around the corridors of the grand colonial building that houses the legislature in Pietermaritzburg this week revealed only one certainty about the provincial parley: talks have reached such a sensitive stage that everyone involved is resolutely sticking to an agreement that the contents be kept secret. Which is another reason why Buthelezi's public comments have created such a stir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was with some senior IFP people on Sunday and they were quite surprised when they read the paper,&quot; said Amichand Rajbansi of the Minority Front. &quot;Buthelezi made some qualifications on Monday, but there is still a heavy emphasis on peace. It is quite clear that inside the IFP there is no longer any support for the idea of working with the Nats to win the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ANC also realises its chances of running the province alone are remote. They know the only chance is for both of them to work together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both parties liken the situation to the secret negotiations which took place in exile between the National Party and the ANC, which prepared the way for a breakthrough in efforts to end apartheid peacefully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IFP parliamentarian Philip Powell, who sat in on the last round of peace talks, told the Mail &amp; Guardian both parties are adhering to a strict confidentiality agreement. &quot;What I can say is both sides have tabled position papers. We are in the process of studying these and exchanging views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are just the opening salvos in the debate. At this stage, there is no formal discussion about one party merging into the other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Powell added the main objective is to &quot;reach an accord&quot; on the right of each party to exist, and to ensure &quot;a normalisation of relations&quot; between the two. A key item on the agenda of the recent round of talks was a new mechanism to provide amnesty for people on each side involved in the violence which has claimed up to 18 000 lives over the past four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is now a structured approach to the question of a special amnesty arrangement for this province. It is far more conservative than the earlier suggestions that there be a blanket amnesty in the region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC leaders were reluctant to explore details of the peace talks in the corridors of the parliamentary building. Some confirmed, however, that a new set of amnesty proposals is being prepared for discussion within their party's provincial structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others stressed a core component of the talks is a &quot;memorandum of understanding&quot; that there be a concerted effort to ensure economic development, especially in violence-prone rural areas, without one party trying to compete with the other for the kudos of delivery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is probably the most vital element of the peace process taking place,&quot; said Rajbansi. &quot;Each party has realised the basic support of the other cannot be shaken.  They know debates about who achieved effective delivery or is responsible for non-delivery will not affect how each of them fare at the elections in 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a tendency, which I would like to see strengthened, which says let's work together during a phase of development and fight about politics after it has been delivered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 60km south of the Howick Falls, just off the highway between Durban and Pietermaritzburg, is a ghetto called Tintown, because its people live in houses of silver corrugated iron built for refugees from a mini civil war which was fought in nearby Hammarsdale during the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tintown reflects signs that the centrist tendencies taking shape in the provincial capital are beginning to spread into some of the rural flashpoints of the province. It is one of those places where intrigue and convoluted local politics can escalate, in a flash, into murder and mayhem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, Tintown's young football team beat the boys from a neighbouring settlement called Panekeni in a two-day tournament. The losers added to their grumbles complaints that there were people in Tintown who secretly supported the IFP. A series of night attacks was launched from ANC support bases on homes in the shantytown, and in December these culminated in the gruesome massacre of nine Inkatha supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moderates in the provincial leadership of both parties saw the place as an emblem of the centrifugal forces that threaten to tear their peace process apart. The ANC suspended officials in its local branch accused of complicity in the murders. A subcommittee of the Portfolio Committee on Safety and Security was set up to deal with the violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of Safety and Security Sydney Mufamadi, along with Nyanga Ngubane, the provincial MEC for traditional affairs, have made high-profile visits. And top police teams have set up camp near the shantytown to control violence and broker civic co-operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result? Violent skirmishes have been curtailed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week provincial leaders from both parties met at the makeshift police station to work out joint security arrangements for an IFP rally on Saturday, an event that would have been unthinkable in no-go zones like this six months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Ntombekayisa Msomi: &quot;We wish to see the ANC and IFP joining hands. We were never IFP members, but we were forced by the attacks that came after the soccer match to join the IFP for protection. I feel bad that today I am meeting the ANC leaders as enemies when we were once part of them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in the old town of Pietermaritzburg are reminders that politics in this unpredictable province can wheel into any number of destructive spirals. One of these is Sifiso Nkabinde, a menacing figure who is standing outside a car filled with bodyguards in the parking lot of the building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkabinde, a warlord who effectively rules the Richmond area near Pietermaritzburg with the help of his armed thugs, was expelled from the ANC earlier this year on grounds that he was a police spy and was implicated in a series of political murders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a sign that the province still lacks a culture of law and order, a man who is known to conduct a reign of terror on his home turf is able to rent offices for his new political movement next to the Department of Land Affairs without fear of being arrested on any of the killings his group is reputed to have carried out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today Nkabinde is polite but too busy to talk to the press. He is on the way to Durban with his men to attend a series of meetings ahead of his plans to launch a new political party with fellow ANC dissident General Bantu Holomisa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two men, whose relationship is alleged to have begun in the apartheid era when Nkabinde travelled to the Transkei homeland (then ruled by Holomisa) to collect weapons for ANC paramilitary units in the Pietermaritzburg area, have been drawing large crowds of late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are picking up support from militant youth, concerned about the growing moderation of their leaders and the secrecy that surrounds the peace talks. And Holomisa is capable of winning ethnic support in the shantytowns of Dambuza, where there are large populations of Xhosa migrants, as well as the southern parts of KwaZulu-Natal, where some Xhosa-speakers are loyal to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But most of the politicians we spoke to in Pietermaritzburg are not overly concerned about the power of a Holomisa-Nkabinde alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps more worrying to both parties is a new and top- secret report which was produced in the headquarters of the National Intelligence Agency in the province this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It shows armed groups are active in many parts of the province as a number of warlords who mobilised around political issues in the past have now turned to various forms of underground crime to retain their power and privilege.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - When Nigeria bombarded Freetown this week in an attempt to dislodge Sierra Leone's new coup leaders, the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and United Nations secretary general Kofi Annan applauded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when signs of trouble became apparent some time before, the world was not so quick off the mark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After then-president Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's civilian government --- Sierra Leone's first in three decades --- signed a peace treaty with Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels in November, Annan asked the UN Security Council to approve a modest peace-keeping force to ensure both sides stuck to the agreement, which included an integrated army and the demobilisation of some rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the council failed to act on his request, made in January. Annan was backed by Britain, Sierra Leone's former colonial master, but the United States reportedly delayed a decision.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the months before the coup it became clear initial optimism about the treaty was misplaced. The RUF, racked by internal disputes, failed to adhere to treaty conditions, while elements of the notoriously ill-disciplined army were alleged to have launched pseudo-rebel attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sierra Leone has a history of instability, fuelled by a multiplicity of military groupings. The main players include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The government of ousted president Kabbah was elected in March last year amid popular dissatisfaction with military rule --- after two earlier coups and widespread civilian casualties in the preceding five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the May 25 coup led by Major Johnny Paul Koroma, Kabbah took refuge in neighbouring Guinea (according to one unconfirmed report, with a 62-carat diamond in his possession pending the resolution of an ownership dispute), while some members of his government were detained by the putschists.  Yet others joined Koroma's Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The RUF took up arms in March 1991 under its leader Foday Sankoh, leading to a conflict which killed more than 10 000 people. In mid-1995 the RUF fought to the outskirts of Freetown, but was beaten back largely due to the intervention of South Africa's Executive Outcomes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seriously weakened by the mercenary outfit and plagued by defections to the government side, the RUF signed the peace agreement with Kabbah in November. But not the entire RUF fell in line. After Sankoh was detained in Nigeria in March on charges of munitions smuggling, a breakaway faction of the RUF announced he was no longer leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in April, two members of the Commission for the Consolidation of Peace set up to manage the November peace accord were abducted by the Sankoh faction of the RUF. The apparent reason: they were accused by Sankoh, from his confinement in Nigeria, of having led the attempt to oust him. The Sankoh faction gained the upper hand. Demobilisation of RUF soldiers fell behind schedule and skirmishes with the army continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The AFRC, set up by Koroma after his coup, is composed largely of junior officers. It came to power aided by prisoners (some of them officers awaiting trial after earlier alleged coup attempts, but mostly common criminals) who were sprung from Freetown's Pademba Road Prison in one of the first acts of Koroma's men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commentators have pointed out the AFRC's apparent closeness to the former National Provisional Ruling Council, the military council that handed power to Kabbah's civilian government last year. Members of the council's top brass, mostly studying overseas, were rumoured to be planning a comeback in the wake of the coup. There was no immediate indication that former head of state Captain Valentine Strasser, at university in Britain, also intended to return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AFRC's pact with the RUF rebels --- they amassed in Freetown shortly after the coup, and Koroma named Sankoh his deputy - -- may have surprised outsiders, but there has been a history of co-operation between the rebels and the army that it fought during the preceding five years. Sierra Leone gave the English language the word &quot;sobel&quot; in apt description of the blurred distinction between soldiers and rebels.  Often, they interchanged their roles, mostly to maximise looting opportunities: soldier by day, rebel by night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The South African mercenary firm Executive Outcomes (EO) was contracted by the ruling council in May 1995 to put an end to the RUF war. Replacing the British Gurkhas, which possibly could not match EO's fierce reputation, the South Africans soon beat the RUF back from the outskirts of Freetown, and from rebel-held diamond areas. While it was not clear exactly how the beleaguered ruling council was able to pay the mercenary firm for its services, it was noticeable how mining interests allied to EO soon controlled prime concessions. EO left Sierra Leone in February after Sankoh had set their departure as one of his conditions for signing the November peace deal with Kabbah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Apart from EO, the Kamajor traditional hunters, said to possess magic powers, made up the strongest fighting force against the RUF. The Kamajors were co-opted as a civilian militia on the government side during the early stages of the war, and remained an effective, if brutal, complement to the army until the peace settlement and afterwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Koroma justified his ousting of Kabbah on the grounds that the civilian president had nurtured &quot;tribal and sectional conflict&quot; - -- apparent reference to Kabbah's continued reliance on the Kamajors. In one of his first acts, Koroma ordered the Kamajors to disband. By midweek there were reports thousands of Kamajors were preparing to march on Freetown against Koroma's AFRC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Jombolas (&quot;removers of pubic hair&quot;) emerged early this year as another group opposed to the Kamajors. Also vested with magic powers, they mesmerised victims, who were either raped (by Jombola men) or seduced (by Jombola women).  It is not clear how this contributed to the Jombola's stated aim of ousting the Kamajors and ultimately staging a coup of its own. The Jombolas left entire communities traumatised in their wake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Nigeria had troops stationed in Sierra Leone, at the time of the coup, as part of a defence agreement between Kabbah and Ecowas, the Nigerian-dominated grouping of West African states. The Nigerian troops did little to prevent Koroma's men from taking power, but now count as the most serious threat to his continued rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the OAU has &quot;authorised&quot; Nigeria to oust Koroma, reports from Freetown suggest many locals view the intervention as an invasion. Indiscriminate shelling of Freetown from a Nigerian gunboat, which led to scores of civilian casualties, did not help change that perception.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Northern Province is witnessing an extraordinary fight between two of it's provincial officials, writes Marion Edmonds</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two senior ANC officebearers in the Northern Province are publicly trading accusations over alleged irregularities linked to the Semenya investigation into corruption in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The speaker of the provincial legislature, Robert Mathavi, claims the finance MEC, Edgar Mushwana, attempted to bribe him to withhold evidence from the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mushwana denies the charge, suggesting instead that Mathavi has abused his position and taken funds under the legislature's control for his personal use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fight comes as political players in the province try to cushion themselves against the imminent release of advocate Ismail Semenya's findings. The investigation was established to probe plans to build a</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">R97-million luxury parliamentary village and government complex in Pietersburg, and the acquisition of expensive property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its report, understood to be damning of senior officials in the provincial government, is due to be released later this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mathavi claimed this week that Mushwana had approached him prior to the Semenya hearings, accused him of misusing funds in the legislature's care, and suggested the two should co- operate in a cover up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I said to him, 'I am not interested in any problems --- I am not going to succumb to you because if I do, than you will blackmail me for the rest of my life,'&quot; Mathavi said. &quot;I knew he did not want me to go before the commission.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mathavi's submission to Semenya panned Mushwana's handling of the project, alleging that he illegally appointed developers to build the complex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I approached him about this inconsistent application of Treasury instructions and when I showed him the letter ...  disproving the virement (transfer) of similar committed funds he immediately saw that they have committed the worst blunder in their handling of financial management control systems. There was no room for backpeddling,&quot; Mathavi's submission said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mushwana denies Mathavi's bribery accusation, saying Mathavi refused to cooperate when he tried to probe alleged irregularities relating to the speaker's administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his submission to the hearing this week, Mushwana insinuated that Mathavi abused his position, after an insurance pay-out of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">R929 000 was banked by the legislature following the death of an MPL last August. He also accused Mathavi of borrowing R15 000 illegally from the legislature without intending to pay it back, and claiming expenses that he ought not have done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In dealing with colleagues, I don't look at faces, I look at rules,&quot; Mushwana said. &quot;I try to manage things with my head and not my heart. It's regrettable that instead of answering to our inquiry, he raises these things before the Semenya commission which was not even within the terms of reference of the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Against my will, I was forced to respond to the allegations made against me, and that is why I gave details of the administrative problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mathavi says he is paying back the loan, albeit a little late. The matter has been referred to the auditor general's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had also instructed a legal firm to set up a trust fund for the two children of the deceased MPL with the permission of the courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mushwana has not yet adequately explained how the money for the complex was shifted without the legislature's approval. &quot;On whether the R97-million has been approved or not, I would prefer not to deal with this matter in detail, save to say that in my opinion the said virement has been done in accordance with applicable rules and procedures,&quot; he said in his submission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fight appears to be exacerbated by personality differences: Mushwana, a former businessman, is flamboyant and easy-going, Mathavi, a former public servant from Gazankulu, is said to take his position seriously and lord it over his colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Premier Ngoako Ramathlodi will have to act swiftly and decisively to stop the rot and defuse growing tension among ANC provincial leaders once Semenya delivers the findings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The national wine co-op has been implicated in trying to sell fake champagne to Europe and the US, report David Beresford and Mungo Soggot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national co-operative which controls South Africa's wine industry, KWV, has been implicated in a major swindle involving the attempted sale of fake champagne to Europe and the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documents obtained by the Mail &amp; Guardian indicate senior KWV officials were party to the fraud, which involved counterfeiting and the attempted sale of 240 000 bottles of bogus champagne into the international wine market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alleged fraud revolves around attempts to market two brands of fake champagne - &quot;Paul Lambert&quot; and &quot;Charles Lemond&quot; - in the early 1990s. It appears to tie in with other international scandals involving attempts to market fake versions of two of France's most famous brands of champagne, Mo&quot;t &amp; Chandon and Dom Perignon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior officials at KWV named in the documents have flatly denied any knowledge of the Paul Lambert and Charles Lemond operation. They say they have never heard of the two brands of &quot;champagne&quot; and have no knowledge of the documents themselves, which include memos and faxes on KWV letterheads.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KWV (Kooperatiewe Wijnbouwers Vereeniging), the national wine co-operative, has various statutory obligations to maintain standards in the industry. It also has a joint controlling interest in the country's two largest liquor producers, with a combined turnover totalling at least 70% of wine and liquor sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hugely wealthy, KWV is currently the subject of a battle for control of its assets, totalling an estimated R1,6- billion. Its 4 751 members - almost all of them white farmers and producers - are demanding that the co-op be privatised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of Agriculture Derek Hanekom - who is arguing that the assets are profits from apartheid and that KWV should be treated as a national asset - is trying to block the move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been suspicions of South African involvement in international champagne frauds since the late 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1991, three fraudsters - Jean-Claude R'maury, Charley Delmare and Marc Proux- Delrouyre - were arrested in Paris in connection with a champagne-counterfeiting scam involving operations in Cuba and South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proux-Delrouyre was stabbed to death in his home before he could be brought to trial - a murder which has never been solved. Delmare and Remaury were convicted of counterfeiting and fraud, and were sentenced to 18 months in jail and a fine of 100 000 francs. In a separate civil claim, Mo&quot;t &amp; Chandon were awarded damages of Fr5-million against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1993 there was more hard evidence of South African involvement in a champagne swindle when police seized 900 000 fake Mo&quot;t &amp; Chandon and Dom Perignon labels which had been printed in Stellenbosch and were awaiting shipment to Panama.  Panama and Cuba have figured prominently in champagne frauds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, after a lengthy police investigation, the attorney general's office in the Cape announced there was insufficient evidence to justify any prosecutions in connection with the fake labels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was reported that, during their investigations, police seized documents showing KWV had exported nearly one million litres of Chenin Blanc and Columbard wines to Cuba in 1990 which had been ordered by &quot;two foreigners&quot;. The attorney general's office said there was no evidence of bad faith on the part of KWV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The use of the term &quot;champagne&quot; is strictly controlled by international law and treaty. To qualify for the description, the wine must be produced from grapes grown in the Champagne district in north-eastern France; the entire production process - including a secondary fermentation process which must take place in the bottle in which it is finally sold - has to be carried out in the demarcated area; and the final product requires a certificate of authenticity issued by the Comit' Interprofesssionel des Vins de Champagne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The documents obtained by the M&amp;G indicate the Paul Lambert and Charles Lemond &quot;champagnes&quot; were made with South African wines and bottled in South Africa with counterfeit labels complete with fake French coding. The Comit' Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne, the champagne regulatory body in France, has confirmed neither brand exists. A representative said Paul Lambert was on its blacklist of counterfeit brands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KWV apparently imported 240 000 premier- grade champagne bottles from one of France's major manufacturers, St Gobain, for the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior officials with KWV International named by the documents as being involved in the operation - codenamed &quot;Project Spark&quot; - include Niel van Staden, currently divisional executive with responsibility for overseas markets, including the US; Dr Danie Retief, an executive director; and J &quot;Kobus&quot; van Niekerk, managing director. Van Niekerk was out of the country this week and not contactable.  Retief and Van Staden emphatically denied any knowledge of the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fax on a KWV letterhead dated August 28 1990 records that on June 27 1990 Van Staden met Marc Reyes (an alleged accomplice in the 1991 Mo&quot;t &amp; Chandon case), Fritz Coetzer (a Stellenbosch export agent) and a Mr Hartman (believed to have been an American agent) to discuss Project Spark.  &quot;Discussions reached an advanced stage and in fact the Design Services Dept were briefed on label designs,&quot; it states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fax says the label designs were presented to the four men by July 6. &quot;The product was tasted and approved. Dr Retief approved the project in principle on June 29 1990, and in his absence Mr J van Niekerk obtained approval on July 23 1990 for the project to proceed provided that orders were received for the full 20 000 cases and acceptable guarantees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Retief approved the ordering of the bottles on August 3 and &quot;KWV proceeded to order 252 000 bottles from France, 240 000 corks from Portugal, printed with the word Champagne, as well as 240 000 gold foil capsules. The value of these goods is R663 000.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An internal memorandum dated September 6 under Van Staden's name gives detailed instructions to another member of KWV for the ordering of labels for the bottles of Paul Lambert and Charles Lemond, and stickers for their cartons.  The memo concludes in Afrikaans: &quot;Remember South Africa must not appear anywhere on any of the packaging materials and neither must the name of the suppliers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not clear from the documents what happened to the fake champagne. But in 1991 America's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) discovered fake champagne was circulating in the US under the Charles Lemond and Paul Lambert labels. The wine was traced back to an import agency, California Clearing, in the town of Tustin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently several thousand cases of Charles Lemond materialised at a Customs auction in Cape Town. Customs officials told local traders the wine had been returned to South Africa after it had been refused entry into the US, and was being sold to defray storage costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A condition of sale was that it could not be resold.  Customs said no guarantee could be given that it had been made by the &quot;Methode Champenoise&quot; method. This was despite the fact that labels described the wine as champagne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G submitted a series of questions to Customs on Wednesday morning regarding the auction, including the circumstances in which the wine was seized; details regarding its previous ownership; whether it was aware its claim to be champagne was fraudulent; whether potential bidders were warned of its fraudulent nature; and whether a fraud inquiry was carried out. Customs had still not replied by the time the M&amp;G went to press.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Department of Water Affairs and Forestry announced on Monday that it had awarded contracts to the value of R700 million to four consortiums to implement community water supply and sanitation projects in areas which have never had these services before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tenders, awarded on the basis of the Build, Operate, Train and Transfer (BOTT) concept, have many positive aspects such as community empowerment through consultation; using local labour; an emphasis on the private company training the local authority and building their capacity to operate the water system; and a mentor programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These aspects, however, must be seen in the broader context of the bottom line, and that is profit. There is no way the private sector would have undertaken these contracts if there was no chance of making a profit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore SAMWU is of the opinion that these contracts do not differ fundamentally from the privatisation that has already taken place in Queenstown, Fort Beaufort and Stutterheim, and which is being planned for Nelspruit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Muller, Director General of DWAF, told SAMWU on Monday that &quot;we were barking up the wrong tree&quot; as SAMWU workers would not be affected by these new BOTT schemes. What Mr Muller fails to realise is that all the other arguments that SAMWU has made against privatisation still apply.  SAMWU's anti-privatisation campaign is largely community based - our research showed that the rest of the world has suffered under privatisation, especially of water services.  SAMWU maintains a strong desire to prevent all South African communities from this suffering, whether our workers are involved or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The way these particular BOTT schemes will work is that DWAF has paid the winning consortiums a fixed rate to build, operate and manage the service - in other words, the consortiums won't be paid out of the tariffs they collect.  Given that this is in the rural areas where tariff collection will be very low or even non-existent, it means that the government must bear the full cost of paying for the private sector to build, operate and maintain. In effect, the private sector, hailed as being a saviour to waterless citizens, is bearing no risk whatsoever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Muller was quoted as saying &quot;We (DWAF) do not have the capacity and need assistance from the private sector&quot;. As it is SAMWU's view that the government didn't even attempt to build capacity within DWAF and the Water Boards to do what they have now brought the private sector in to do; we find this statement invalid! SAWMU holds strong positions on the role that Water Boards can play in the delivery of water services where the local authority does not have a capacity.  Why has DWAF not exploited the potential of the Water Boards instead of throwing in the proverbial towel in favour of the private sector?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike Muller told SAMWU over the phone that the four consortiums were awarded two year contracts. However, upon examining the tender documents, SAMWU has found that the length of the contracts have not been specified. As part of their bid, the private companies are meant to draw up business plans for providing water in particular areas, and that business plan must specify the length of the contract.  We feel strongly that the bid documents of the winning companies should be made open to the public, so that can see how long the contract is for, as well as how the consortiums intend to handle the project. So far, SAMWU has had difficulty in gaining access to the final contracts.  ./more</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DWAF was also hesitant when asked by SAMWU how these BOTT schemes differed from privatisation. In terms of BOTT principles, once the system is built, and the local authority has the capacity to operate the system, the private company must hand over (transfer) the system to the local authority.  After that, the private company must provide a three year mentor programme. While this is obviously intended to strengthen the ability of the local authority to operate the system on their own in the future there is nothing to actually prevent the local authority putting the water services out to tender again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is particularly relevant in this case - this particular programme only caters for the provision of water and sanitation up the basic RDP level of 25 litres per person per day within 200 m and VIPs. This means that if the local authority wants to upgrade the facilities (which will they will want to do if they want to be able to properly meter the water that households use and bill them accordingly) they are likely to again turn to the private sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that privatisation of water delivery (in the form of public-private partnerships, and contracting out) is seemingly imminent in South Africa, who would be better to win the tender than the company which build and operated the system in the first place?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAMWU also has a grave problem with the companies that make up the consortiums. WSSA, a subsidiary of Lyonnaise Des Eaux (one of the major world water controllers) is there as part of two consortiums, as well as Aquafund. In other words, this programme that DWAF has initiated is perpetuating the international trend where very few companies will dominate water service sector in South Africa.  /ends</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sweden says that it will give balance of payment aid to Zambia only if political dialogue between political parties is effected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sweden's ambassador to Zambia, Kristina Svensen, said that in the absence of political dialogue in the country, Sweden cannot support the country with aid because economic development must involve all political forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INQUIRY INTO UNIVERSITY OF ZAMBIA PROBLEMS REVEALS ALLEGED &quot;SHADY&quot; DEALS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An on-going Commission of Inquiry into the problems at the University of Zambia (UNZA), and the Copperbelt University (CBU), has brought to the fore accusations of &quot;shady&quot; deals by the university authorities and a deputy minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A head of department at UNZA charged that deputy health minister Professor Nkandu Luo was lecturing at the institution contrary to a recently effected code of conduct that bars political leaders from lecturing at the university.  Another witness charged that UNZA had 48 bank accounts, some of which were allegedly used for siphoning money out of the institution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WORKERS' UNIONS DEMAND PROMPT PAYMENT OF SALARIES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil servants have called on the government to honour its collective agreement obligation of paying the public service workers on time to avert strikes and to boost production. The call was made after a work stoppage by about 200 general workers at Zambia's major hospital, the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka. The workers abandoned work for two days before being persuaded to return to their tasks by union leaders. They were protesting a delay in being paid their salaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some teachers around the country have also been threatening to stop work because of a delay in paying them their salaries. Government has promised that the money will soon be available. But some teachers have vowed to boycott this year's supervising of examinations and the marking of examination papers because government has in the past failed to honour its promise to pay them on time. Government recently awarded public service workers a salary increase of K40,000 (about US$35) and new conditions of service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LIQUIDATED BANK WORKERS PROTEST</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scores of former workers of the liquidated Lima Bank, a lending institution for farmers, recently staged a protest at the Ministry of Agriculture to demand payment of their terminal benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workers, who were joined by their wives and children., demanded that they be paid their dues promptly because they and their families have been starving since the firm was closed about a month ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOVERNMENT NOT TO INTERFERE IN MAIZE PRODUCTION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government has announced that it will not interfere or take part in the production and supply of maize, Zambia's staple food, during the 1997/98 farming season. And, despite a forecast that the country could have a deficit of its annual requirement of maize, government will not restrict the exportation of the grain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision is in line with the government policy of letting market forces determine prices and distribution of any farm produce. However, some observers, including those in the farming community, say that government's pull out of the agriculture sector should have been more gradual and that they now fear that because of the forecast shortage, prices of the commodity could rise beyond the reach of many Zambians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EASTERN PROVINCE APPEALS FOR FOOD AID</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Paramount Chief of the Eastern Province has requested an immediate supply of relief food to the region because he said people in the area are starving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paramount Chief Mpezeni said that some people were leaving the area because they had been unable to grow enough food to last them until the next farming season. He attributed the food deficit to an inadequate supply of seed and fertiliser.  The province usually has a food surplus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some other parts of the province, farmers have appealed to government to repair roads and bridges that were washed away by rains for them to be able to deliver their produce to markets. Works and Supply deputy minister, Celestino Chibamba, has promised to have the bridges repaired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZAMBIANS FACE INCREASE OF ELECTRICITY TARIFFS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Electricity consumers could soon be paying more for the commodity, following Energy Minister Suresh Desai's advice that supply cannot be increased sufficiently unless more income is generated through increased tariffs. The veiled proposal to the Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO) could, however, trigger renewed opposition from consumers, many of whom already contend that the current tariffs are too high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister's advice follows a warning by Zesco's consumer relations manager Louis Changula that Zambia risked becoming deficient in electricity by the year 2001 unless new energy generating stations are constructed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CALLS FOR ABOLITION OF DEATH PENALTY CONTINUE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pressure on government to abolish the death penalty continues to grow with an added voice coming from a seminar recently held by the Zambia Prison Fellowship Association.  Participants at the seminar resolved that government should discontinue the death penalty and have life-imprisonment as the maximum penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The participants noted that with Zambia being declared a Christian nation soon after the MMD came into power in 1991, it was only logical that the death penalty too be abolished.  Eight condemned prisoners have been executed by hanging since 1991.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - As some parties called for dialogue between the political parties, conflicts within some of these parties have increased in recent weeks. Most hit by the internal squabbling are the ruling MMD and the Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the MMD, several middle-rank members have been suspended on charges of defying a ban on campaigning for the party presidency. The party national secretary, Michael Sata, recently undertook a tour of Luapula Province, President Chiluba's home region, where some party members charged that a cabinet minister had been campaigning in the area for the presidential elections due in the year 2001. Shortly after his trip, provincial party leaders announced the suspension of the provincial minister Norman Chibamba and a few other leaders from the party for allegedly disorganising the party.  The next day, Sata nullified the suspensions and instead suspended the leaders who endorsed the suspension of Chibamba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the ZDC, internal wranglings have increased following the suspension of three senior members accused of going against collective responsibility. Party vice-presidents Kasuka Mutukwa (for policy), and Susan Jere (for gender), along with treasurer, Dante Saunders, were suspended after they disagreed with party president Dean Mung'omba's call to remove the MMD government &quot;by whatever means&quot;. Several other party members have condemned the call and some of them have since resigned from the party. The three leaders have rejected their suspensions and have instead called for a national party convention at which party differences could be resolved.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - When President Chiluba endorsed Zambia as a Christian nation soon after the MMD came to power in 1991, some people voiced their opposition to such a declaration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon, however, the criticism died out and the Christian community in Zambia went full throttle in its efforts to spreads the faith. Recent developments in the country, however, point to the Christians facing a new form of resistance - Satanism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early this year, a couple of youths in the densely populated province of the Copperbelt claimed that a group of Satanists was operating under-ground and recruiting members at a rate that called for concern. They said they had been part of the group but decided to pull out of it because they realised that devil worshipping was wrong. No one paid much attention to the two youths' revelation but three months on, another confession was made by another young woman in Lusaka who disclosed that faith in Satan was growing in the capital and that the Satanists were on an aggressive campaign to outwit the spread of Christianity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More revelations as to the existence of devil-worship have been made over recent weeks and now Christians are beginning to take the issue more seriously, calling for concerted efforts to counter Satanism. Some of those who have broken away from the Satanist groups contend that there is a deliberate plan by the Satanists to take over the country by infiltrating various key organisations, business, the judiciary, the political field and even the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This message first came in February,&quot; says Christian Unity Ministries (CUMI), national secretary Timothy Situmbeko of the alleged plot by Satanists to take over Zambia and destroy Christian institutions in Zambia. &quot;We hesitated to tell the people about it, but continued to pray. Then early this month it was repeated.&quot; He added that there had been at least one Satanist planted in some of the many born-again churches in an effort to derail the Christian faith and cause divisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa Church of God leader, Bishop John Mambo agrees that there is a plot to destroy Christianity in Zambia. He contends that many cults have been formed in the disguise of churches and already deep divisions are beginning to show among the Christians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police spokesman Standwell Lungu says that there is no law that would bar Satanists from practising their faith, but the concern of many Christians is that the devil's faith is said to include human sacrifices. Some reformed devil worshipers have claimed that the drinking of human blood is part of a major ritual that Satanists have to practice. For now, however, no one has come out in the open yet to confess that he or she practices Satanism. And those that claim to have belonged to the faith have not quite been able to expose those still practising the faith. For many Christians, however, this is not an assurance that Satanism is not a serious threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Christians must be ready for attacks from the devil,&quot; Zambia Episcopal Conference Secretary General, Father Ignatius Mwebe says. &quot;The Church as a body has to fight the prince of darkness. We are his first target. Goodness is always the target of evil.&quot; Bishop Mambo also said that the mushrooming of cults was getting out of hand he wanted government to scrutinise all the churches to prevent church wars that could destroy Christianity in the country. Recent months has seen an increased number of divisions in various churches, resulting in splinter groups forming up to follow their own methods of prayer. Bishop Mambo fears that if such divisions were allowed to continue, cults could emerge and Christianity could become vulnerable to devil worshipers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Satanists are said to be very selective in their recruitment of members. According to a young woman who recently broke away from the devil's faith, some Satanists operate from Christian churches from which they recruit their members. She said that those in social or financial problems were often the main targets for recruitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some political parties too are concerned about the increased reports of Satanism. The National Democratic Party (NDP) recently stated that the MMD government was not doing enough to curb the spread of Satanism. NDP Copperbelt Province chairman Isaac Chileshe said that government should investigate increasing reports of Satanism taking root in Zambia. The party contends that the seeds of Satanism were being planted by foreigners and it demands that the government deports those involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police spokesman Lungu says action against Satanists can only be taken if there is evidence that some of their practices were, by Zambian laws, illegal. He said that investigations had been instituted on some of the charges made by reformed Satanists but that no evidence had yet come to light on which the police could base a prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some Christians, the solution to curb the spread of Satanism is in prayer. The Baptist Church in Lusaka, for instance, has embarked on special prayers for those who may have drifted into Satanism. It is hoped that the power of prayer will help redirect them to Christianity. But with the Zambian constitution categorical that Zambia would be tolerant of other religions, there is little much else Christians can do but pray that the Christian faith will overshadow Satanism.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Text of questions and answers on Sierra Leone by State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns at the Department's daily briefing June 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: My announcement is that Ambassador Bill Richardson leaves tonight for the Congo. He leaves as head of an interagency delegation at the request of Secretary Albright. That delegation will include Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney of Georgia. They plan to meet with President Laurent Kabila in Lubumbashi on Saturday. They will be meeting with other government officials of the Congo. I expect Ambassador Richardson will want to talk to the UNHCR and the International Committee on the Red Cross on humanitarian questions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, let me tell you why he is going and what he hopes to do. He is going to engage the new leadership of the Congo to see if we can make our views known to that government very directly and at a very senior level -- he is a member of the Cabinet -- and to press the following points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, the United States believes that the new government ought to aim itself at an inclusive political system. That means a political system that will produce democratic institutions, that will be broad-based; a government that will include members of the opposition, which the current government does; a government that will be devoted to heading the country and orienting it towards elections; and a government that will respect the civil liberties of the people, press freedoms and religious freedoms, that will be tolerant of other ethnic minorities. In Zaire, there are several hundred of them -- ethnic minorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, a government that will be devoted to a liberal economy, a free economy, and an economy that will be open to Western investment, including, we hope, American investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, a government that will put human rights at the forefront of its agenda. There have been many very serious allegations made about reported alleged human rights abuses, massacres of Rwandan Hutu refugees near Kisangani. We believe very strongly that the United Nations should be let into Kisangani to interview the refugees, to interview the rebel forces that were there, and to try to find out what happened and to try to help the government of the Congo bring those people to justice who were responsible for the massacres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourth, we hope that the new government will be open to continued humanitarian assistance by the United Nations, the International Committee on the Red Cross, American and European and African non-governmental organizations. The people of the Congo are desperately poor. They are in need of medical assistance and food assistance and development assistance. We would like to see the new government of the Congo open to a cooperative relationship with the international humanitarian organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those are some of the issues that Bill Richardson will be raising on this very important trip. Now, he may go on to other countries in the region. He does not have an endpoint to the trip yet. I will keep you informed as soon as he makes those decisions. He hasn't made them yet. But the focus will be on meeting with Laurent Kabila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Are the promises of assistance conditional on meeting the other criteria?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I think we have always said, the United States, and I know that other countries, are quite willing to help the government of the Congo. However, we are going to need to be assured that it is a government that is interested in a democratic evolution for the Congo and economic reform, a government that will pay attention to the human rights problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we can be assured of that, then I think that the United States will be ready to extend economic assistance to the Congo. We have not yet communicated any specific numbers to them, and will not be making any ironclad promises, until we have a greater perspective to see the performance of this particular government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Remember the dangling of promises of help with the elections which, it was a rather large figure that he said was insufficient, according to some accounts within the government. Are you going to whisper an amount in his ear that won't be an ironclad guarantee but give him an idea of the proportions of aid that he might expect?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I think it will certainly be put before him the clear understanding that the United States, the international development institutions and other countries are going to be ready to help the Congo. But we need to see the establishment of some of these broad-based, democratic, economic goals that are very important. We don't want to put money into a country that will go backwards. We want to put money into a country that is going to go forward on a democratic basis. Laura.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Is Ambassador Richardson going to try to go to Kisangani or attempt to get access to any of these areas while he is on this trip?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: He has already been to Kisangani. He went up on his last trip. He interviewed some of the refugees, including a woman who had just lost her child that day. He interviewed some of the people who have been subjected to some of these brutal attacks by the rebel forces. Now, Mr. Kabila has said since then that he will hold those who perpetrated the injustices accountable, and we hope very much that that will be the case. I don't believe we have seen any of that yet, any action. We need to see the action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So I don't believe that Bill Richardson will be going to Kisangani, having been there before to interview the refugees. Now, most of the refugees who were subject to the attacks and who have survived the attacks have moved on back to Rwanda as part of the UN-sponsored and US-financed evacuation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Do you have any interim assessment of how close or how far Kabila is coming along the lines you would like him to travel?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: It is quite hard to answer that question because the track record is not very long. The one good thing I can point to is that he has taken into his government some members of other political parties who are not part of the rebel alliance. That is positive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the negative side, as you know, he has not allowed expressions of different political views to be made public.  He has shut down the ability of some of the opposition parties to demonstrate. I don't believe one can say that there is freedom of the media in the Congo. These are important criteria that we have to measure him by. You know, we have to hold people to high standards because the people of the Congo deserve that.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Yesterday's announcement by President Daniel Arap Moi that the Kenyan government intends to amend the Public Order Act is a welcome recognition of the need for improvements in human rights protection, an Amnesty International delegation visiting Kenya said today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We welcome this recognition of the necessity of constitutional and legal reform -- which is a key message of Amnesty International's Human Rights Manifesto for Kenya,&quot; said Pierre Sane, Secretary General of the worldwide human rights organization. &quot;However, the Public Order Act is just one of a range of laws which require repeal or amendment to guarantee the basic human rights of all Kenyans.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even with the proposed amendment of this Act, the President would retain wide powers to limit the human rights stipulated in the constitution, such as those included in the Preservation of Public Security Act. By invoking these powers, the government can continue to restrict freedom of association, expression and personal liberty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is needed is a strengthening of the constitution to bring it in line with Kenya's obligations under international law, including the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, adopted in Nairobi in 1981&quot; Mr Sane added, reiterating his request to meet with President Moi to discuss the organization's manifesto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Public Order Act has been widely used to restrict any activity the government regards as opposition to the state, including the peaceful rally planned for Uhuru Park last Saturday, which was violently broken up by police and General Service Unit personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Moi announced the amendment of the Public Order Act and its replacement with a proposed Peaceful Assemblies Bill to cover public gatherings. However, Mr Sane argued that there are provisions in the act apart from those relating to public gatherings which need to be reformed, such as those relating to curfews and the prohibition of flags and emblems of political organizations. There must also be effective remedies for breaches of fundamental human rights, including the authority for the courts to scrutinize legislation and comment upon its constitutionality, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's about time that Kenya breaks with its colonial legacy by repealing oppressive laws enacted at the time to deprive Kenyans from the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights,&quot; Mr Sane added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - United States of America: Amnesty International outraged about possible death sentence against South African teenager in Mississippi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International is urgently calling on John Kitchens, the District Attorney of Madison County, not to impose a death sentence against Azikiwe Kambule, a 17-year- old black South African, who goes on trial for his life in Mississippi on 16 June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Almost the entire world has now recognised that the execution of juvenile offenders is unacceptable. It is shocking that the United States of America (USA) is still one of the few nations willing to put children to death,&quot; Amnesty International said today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The execution of juvenile offenders is an extremely grave human rights violation and, by executing juveniles, the USA finds itself in the company of some of the worlds' worst violators of human rights.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1990, only five countries are known to have executed people who were under 18 at the time of the crime -- Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and the USA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kambule's co-defendant, Santonio Berry, an adult, who has admitted that he murdered Pam McGill and has also stated that Kambule was not present during the killing, has accepted a plea-bargain of life imprisonment without parole in return for his testimony against Kambule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That the juvenile, who may well have been under the control of the older offender and who did not actually commit the murder, is the one facing a death sentence, shows the inequalities in the administration of the death penalty in the USA,&quot; the human rights organization said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to information received by Amnesty International, Kambule was travelling in a car with Santonio Berry, aged 21, on 25 January 1997, when Berry spotted Pam McGill in a red sports car and decided to follow her in order to steal the car. When McGill stopped outside her home Berry forced her at gunpoint to get back into the car and told Kambule to get in the back seat. He then drove to a secluded wood, told Kambule to wait, and forced McGill to walk into the woods where he shot her. Kambule claims that he was unaware that Berry intended to steal a car until it happened and was also unaware that Berry intended to murder McGill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the event of a guilty verdict the jury's options for sentencing are limited to death or life imprisonment without parole. Both sentences violate the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Rights of the Child, which states: &quot;Neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without the possibility of parole shall be imposed for crimes committed by persons below 18 years of age.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kambule has no criminal record or history of violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The execution of people aged 18 and under at the time of the crime is expressly forbidden under international human rights law, in recognition of the fact that the death penalty is wholly inappropriate for individuals who have not yet attained full physical or emotional maturity. Such treaties and standards include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the American Convention on Human Rights (ACHR), the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the Safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty, adopted by the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in 1984 (resolution 1984/50).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US signed the ICCPR in 1977 and ratified it in April 1992. However, the US government reserved its right &quot;subject to its Constitutional constraints&quot; to impose capital punishment on persons below 18 years of age. The USA remains one of the few countries that has not ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-five of the 38 US States that have the death penalty permit the execution of juvenile offenders. There are currently more than 45 juvenile offenders under sentence of death in 14 States. The majority of known executions of juvenile offenders worldwide take place in the USA (nine since 1985). The last known execution of a juvenile offender worldwide was that of Christopher Burger in the USA (Georgia) on 9 December 1993.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) resolution to give the go ahead to the West African Peacekeeping Force to restore the democratically elected government of Sierra Leone marks a new beginning in African politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a clear message that Africa will not tolerate undemocratic, dictatorial and militaristic regimes and no one must hide behind the OAU Charter in order to impose unpopular regimes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The significance of this decision is that once and for all Africa is shedding its image of being a continent which deals with its political problems through militaristic solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC therefore fully supports this resolution by the OAU. It is time now that such problems are resolved politically and through peaceful and political means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC takes this opportunity to congratulate President Robert Mugabe on his election as chairperson of the OAU. This is indicative of the increasing role that Southern Africa is playing in the affairs of Africa as a whole.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - On a bright shiny autumn day in Cape Town this week, the leader of Inkatha, Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi met Democratic Party leader Tony Leon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They met to discuss finding ways of greater co-operation.  They were not the only ones who have sought new forms of co- operation over the past few days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a small parliamentary lounge where members sip their afternoon tea, National Party leader F W de Klerk met Freedom Front leader General Constand Viljoen.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Gauteng, the deputy-chairman of the National Party's fundraising committee, Mr Jan Bredenkamp, announced that he was to join the Roelf Meyer initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in Parliament, the Pan Africanist Congress finally said goodbye to former leader Clarence Makwetu when Mr Michael Meundane took his place in the National Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week has seen an ongoing flurry of activity as opposition parties seek out new allies in an attempt to strengthen their hand at the next election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Meyer's sudden departure from the National Party has attracted considerable attention. The broader question, however, is whether these opposition initiatives will constitute for the electorate a real check on political power in 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A viable opposition is an essential ingredient for a healthy democracy, hence the excitement when there are signs of political realignment. Roelf Meyer is right when he says democracy has to be extended beyond the adoption of the new constitution. It will be hard to find a politician who disagrees with him on that score. However, how meaningful are these signs of realignment?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the excitement among opposition politicians, it is necessary to examine the outcome of this week's &quot;toenaderings&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting in Sea Point between Dr Buthelezi and Mr Leon ended with a statement that &quot;there will be enhanced co- operation between the parties in Parliament, provincial legislatures and local government&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After his meeting with Mr De Klerk, General Viljoen said the two parties would meet again, but that there existed fundamental differences in approach between them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Meyer told the Press Gallery Association he would know after two months of consultation how his new party would look. At a lunch held with journalists at Parliament, he was his usual affable self, smiling broadly and completely likeable. &quot;We now have a new situation and I see tremendous opportunities,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he was unable to point to the support base from which he expected to launch his new party. &quot;The support base I would like to see has to be representative of all communities in South Africa,&quot; he said. &quot;The work now has to start and we must work full out for the new objectives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where will he get his financial support? &quot;Money-wise, it is still too early to say now exactly where it will come from,&quot; he said, squeezing together the palms of his hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe if I look at the responses of the business community locally, it looks like they are responsive to this idea of creating a new political home in South Africa,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any seasoned politician knows that it takes time and resources to build a party. The ANC was established in 1912 and came to power in 1994. But those were different circumstances. A more appropriate analogy would be the birth of the old Progressive Party in 1961.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Racked by differences over issues of land in 1959, the United Party split and some of its members went on to form the Progressive Party. Two years later, Mrs Helen Suzman became the first elected member of the new party. Thirteen years later, the Progressive Party was able to win four seats in Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Building a new party is not a simple matter as most of the 26 parties in the last election discovered. Shortly before the elections in 1994, a host of parties emerged. Perhaps there are some of us who still remember KISS, Keep It Straight and Simple. Seven of the parties made it to Parliament. The ACDP, one of the new parties, won two seats.  The majority of new parties won negligible votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viable opposition means being able to pose a threat to the re-election of politicians. The present opposition parties, when closely questioned, acknowledged that they did not represent a serious threat to the ANC in 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The principal guarantee of meaningful opposition from now until 1999, lies within the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The December conference of the party will provide an indication of the extent to which real curbs on power exist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mandela has made a clear statement encouraging criticism within the ANC. He is, however, not a contender at the December conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When ANC members gather this year, many will be conscious of the fact that their political careers depend on the public positions they take. But there are also a large number of ANC members who have little personal stake in the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Human Sciences Research Council, those of them who are completely disillusioned will not join other parties, but will withdraw from the political process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, those who continue to take part, if organised effectively, will represent the only guarantee that the leadership of the movement remains on track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Meyer says he wants to restructure the South African political scene. The &quot;two months of consultation around the country&quot; to which he has committed himself, will be only the beginning of such restructuring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor does the announcement that Jan Bredenkamp has joined Mr Meyer tell of a major realignment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr Bredenkamp is an ordinary member of the NP,&quot; said NP spokesman Jan Bosman. &quot;He is deputy-chair of a committee and comes from a West Rand branch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An assessment of meaningful opposition requires a closer look at the present dynamics within the ANC which play themselves out in branches and provinces and the national executive committee of the ANC - and will be on display at the December conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those with real concern about immediately viable opposition would do well to watch the run-up to the conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the interplay of the balance of forces within the ANC which will provide a sharp indication of the existence of viable opposition in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All other initiatives are unlikely to produce a real challenge to determining which politicians will be public representatives after the elections in 1999.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1547 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - You could say that Steve Biddulph of Australia is on a mission to save the much-troubled male species from itself. For trouble is what men and fathers are in and what they face in the future - unless they change and change soon, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then again, mild-mannered and refreshingly atypical male that he is, Biddulph stresses that he is not simply a proselytiser, and thinks that when it comes to the subject of parenting, all expert advice should be treated with extreme caution and circumspection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a miserably cold and wet Tuesday night, about 500 parents packed a school hall to listen to what Biddulph had to say on the subject of parenting and, specifically, fathering.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A family psychologist, he has written several books on the subject (his first was The Secret of Happy Children and his most recent is called Manhood), which have sold half a million copies and have been translated into five languages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But first let me tell you about Biddulph himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tall and lean, looking almost like an overgrown teenager, with warm, expressive hazel eyes, he is unusually self- effacing yet also exudes a quiet self-confidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good evening everyone, I'm Steve ...,&quot; is how he starts his talk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon, with his easy-going, relaxed manner and a natural ability for storytelling, he has the audience eating out of his hands - and sometimes in fits of laughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a chat at a city hotel, Biddulph tells me why he uses humour in talking about what is, after all, a very serious subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We give that talk to around 20 000 people every year,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that a fair proportion of those who come are very reluctant to be there, expecting to be preached to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So what I did was to study people like Scottish comedian Billy Connelly and Robin Williams because I think they are wonderful storytellers. I used to work a lot with people who had severe trauma, and what you realise is that humour is so important in life and it enables you to move through uncomfortable things like nothing else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you analyse last night's talk, there were some very confronting messages in the talk but because they came among so much humour, it enabled them to get past people's defences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I ask Biddulph about his own childhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was a very shy child ... I barely spoke when I was a child at school ... I think there was a frustrated wish to be social and my kids have both got that. (He has two - a son aged 11 and a daughter, 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Manhood, Steve has written about the need for men to liberate themselves, partly by being more expressive and more &quot;emotionally free&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I started off as quite a basket case as a young man ...  my life wasn't looking all that good, but I wanted to develop and to grow and I'm relaxed now because I have undergone a liberation process. I'm now comfortable with feelings and with tears and pain - I'm comfortable with myself,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I may be funny-looking - I'm tall, my voice is unusual and my manner very animated ... the opposite of a suit and tie corporate man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But what I think is that inside the corporate man is a poet and a storyteller wanting to come out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And as the men's movement spreads around the world, more men are becoming freer and more colourful and warmer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there is one thing for which Biddulph is known to crusade, then it is for what he sees as the last and &quot;possibly most essential&quot; liberation movement of the century - the men's movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stresses that it aims to produce not effeminate and effete men - a kind of &quot;new age sensitive man&quot; with a stronger feminine psyche than male - but rather fully masculine men who are still male in every sense of the word but who, at the same time, are able to express and to share their feelings and to communicate with their wives and with other men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes people say that men have to get in touch with their feminine side to be nurturing or kind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that's a terrible thing to say because it suggests that masculine doesn't go with being caring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if I'm cuddling a baby or listening to a friend who is a bit distressed, then that's a masculine activity ...  it's masculine to care for children and it's masculine to prepare food and there's a masculine way of doing that - I am not an imitation mother.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bidduplh feels confident that the corner has been turned, that boys and men are changing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon, he says, &quot;we will raise a boy who is in touch with his feelings&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his talk Biddulph tells the audience, &quot;there are probably 100 things to know about fathering but I know five and will share them with you&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a nutshell, his five golden rules are: &quot;Spend time with your son.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve is known to have said that &quot;if a father works more than 55 hours a week he will fail as a parent&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you work long hours you will damage your daughters - and you will cripple your sons,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only by spending time - and lots of it - with children, are parents able to enjoy what Bidduplh calls &quot;those magic moments&quot; (One never knows when they will happen).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rule two: &quot;Play rough and tumble games with sons&quot;.  (Because little boys love to wrestle).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three: &quot;Teach sons to respect women&quot;. (&quot;At age 14, a young boy notices that he is bigger than his mother. The thought crosses his mind - 'she cannot make me do it'&quot;.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rule Four: &quot;Honour their tender feelings.&quot; (Allow children to be sad and to be scared.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bidduplh's fifth rule is one that he regards as important and often overlooked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Teach sons to do housework.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you ask your son 'How was school?' you will probably get a one word 'Fine',&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if you spend time with him and, say, teach him how to cook a souffle, you will find he will talk more easily to you.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Police and the defence force confiscated drugs, a stolen gun, and other stolen property in a huge pre- dawn raid on Boys Town in Old Crossroads today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police spokesman Mark Romburgh said the operation, by at least 400 police and soldiers, was launched at 4am after a tip-off that criminals were operating from the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police from the Public Order Policing Services Unit sealed off the area with barbed wire and manned a control point while members of other units, including the Dog Unit and the Gang Unit, did door-to-door searches.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police arrested seven people for possession of an illegal firearm and a stolen cellphone and dealing in dagga. A stolen car, three drums of dagga, a 7.65 calibre revolver, and a new roll-up garage door were confiscated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simon Mpembe, chief of Pro-Active Policing in the West Metropole division, who led the raid said the operation went smoothly and he was delighted that the Boys Town community had openly welcomed the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police would conduct similar raids in Crossroads and other areas more regularly in future, Director Mpembe added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Police have ordered a clampdown on the release of all current crime statistics - forcing the media and the public to rely on officially audited quarterly reports which will only be made public several months later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg police spokesman Mark Reynolds confirmed that police commissioner George Fivaz had issued the order. Mr Fivaz's order confirmed an earlier directive issued in January, Inspector Reynolds said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Originally, the order applied only to area headquarters.  Now it has been extended to local police station level.  Previously stations had been allowed to release &quot;operational statistics&quot;, a term which had never been clearly defined, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Head of police communications, Director Joseph Ngobeni, said the clampdown had been ordered by the ministry of safety and security. Only quarterly reports could be released because the information would be &quot;audited, accurate and credible&quot;. The report for the period January-March 1997 would only be released next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi's spokesman, Maxwell Malaudzi, last night denied the clampdown had been ordered by the minister, saying &quot;it was a recommendation from police management&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - An Olympic flame was to have been lit in St George's Mall, but the idea has been doused by Cape Town's fire chief as a danger to public safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unlit copy of the Olympic torch has been standing in the mall outside Nedbank, one of the official sponsors of Cape Town's 2004 Bid, for several months.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fire chief Don Sparks told Cape Town municipality's engineering services committee yesterday it would be &quot;irresponsible&quot; of him to allow the flame, because of the risk of a gas explosion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Sparks said the fire service was guided by South African Bureau of Standards rules that gas cylinders be in locked cages, usually on private premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gas needed for the Olympic torch would amount to &quot;a bomb&quot; in the mall, said Mr Sparks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman said that Nedcor accepted the fire department's decision, and a new home would be found for the torch.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - It must be the rugby season. It's early June, the Lions are here, the slanging matches and the controversies have intensified</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rugby tours to a country as obsessed with the game as ours is are more than mere visits by international sports teams.  What happens off the field often takes on a life of its own and becomes as significant as what transpires on it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not a uniquely South African phenomenon. It's the same in New Zealand, a similarly rugby-crazy country. It is definitely the case when England and Australia come to grips in an Ashes series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who can say how much Mark Waugh motivated England with his disparaging remarks about English cricket shortly before the present series? His contempt for the England team must have been one reason why the English bowlers were so charged up, and so successful, against Australia's batsmen yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mind game is as vital in sport as the physical effort.  That is why the psychological sparring is often more than just hype. The propaganda war between the touring British Lions and their hosts started long before our rugby visitors arrived; it has only become more intense since they landed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever their skills on the field - and these have been impressive - the Lions have shown themselves to be masters in the art of psyching their opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already they have reduced to ridicule a principal antagonist, James Small, and exposed some of our players - second-stringers admittedly - as vicious brutes, while deflecting perceptions of weaknesses on their part. They have emerged from the squabble with Small and the assault in Witbank as men of iron discipline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All this while our rugby is again embroiled in internecine war, this time between the national coach and the WP one. The Lions must be laughing. If we can't get our off the field act together, let's hope we can do it on the field. It would be sad if we lost both battles.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - One in five cases referred to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) during its first two months of operation came from the Western Cape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 2 917 disputes referred to it, Gauteng province accounted for 31%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CCMA director Charles Nupen told a news conference that the commercial and distributive sector accounted for 19% of cases.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A surprising trend was that domestic workers and the agricultural sector accounted for 4% each of cases the CCMA handled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the commission was established, domestic workers and farm labourers seldom resorted to mediation to resolve disputes with their employers, Mr Nupen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CCMA was established in November to resolving disputes between employers and employees in the quickest possible time. Previously complainants had to wait for months before their cases were resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Nupen yesterday presented the commission's first annual report to Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It contained few surprises, with the bulk of issues mediated involving unfair dismissal disputes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CCMA had conducted 1 244 conciliations between November and December and had settled 86% of these, the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng province, the industrial hub of South Africa, had 382 cases and the Western Cape 245.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Nupen said Labour Minister Tito Mboweni had appointed an Essential Services Committee which would operate under the auspices of the CCMA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee was established to investigate which sectors performed essential services, that if interrupted, could harm the South African population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mboweni, who was also at the news conference, said the CCMA had done magnificent work in a short space of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission had resolved labour disputes that could have been harmful to the economy, Mr Mboweni said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year, the CCMA was reported to be drowning in a sea of cases, with workers referring the smallest disputes to the body commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Nupen said at the time that some of the disputes could have been solved without the CCMA's intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of the workload, the Government granted the CCMA an increased annual budget of R120 million, which enabled it to hire an additional 40 commissioners, Mr Nupen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are in the process of interviewing people throughout the country,&quot; Mr Nupen said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The hunt is on for Cape Town's most wanted &quot;parking criminals&quot;, who owe thousands of rands in fines.  Their cars will be impounded if they don't declare themselves to the traffic department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A &quot;hot-list&quot; of the vehicles with the highest number of outstanding parking fines has been released by the department.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public parking enemy No 1 is a BMW, last seen in Queen Victoria Street, which has accumulated R5 400 in parking tickets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All 43 vehicles on the May list owe more than R1 000 in fines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town traffic chief Mark Sangster describes the offenders as &quot;professional parking criminals who play cat- and-mouse with the traffic department&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the owners often did not register changes of address or notify the authorities when their vehicles changed hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hot list details makes of cars, registration numbers, how much money is owed, and where the vehicles were last seen. This has been the practice of the traffic department for several years, but has not been publicised until now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Councillor Ian Iversen suggested the list be published so Cape Town citizens could &quot;spot the criminal&quot; and inform the traffic department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the vehicles are found, they may be towed to the traffic headquarters at Gallows Hill, Green Point, in terms of a section of the Road Traffic Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When an owner arrives to collect a vehicle, the name and address of the responsible person will be verified and any summonses or warrants will be served.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The traffic department is not able to keep vehicles until the fines have been paid, but draft regulations to decriminalise road traffic offences authorise officials to immobilise vehicles until outstanding fines, plus a 20 percent surcharge, are paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The draft legislation also states that no vehicle will be licensed unless all outstanding fines, costs and levies are paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, a sub-committee of councillors is formulating an action plan based on &quot;equal justice and equal service&quot; to deal with outstanding warrants of arrest for traffic offences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another move aimed at improving parking control, the council's engineering services committee has authorised a pilot scratch-card system for parking at the Rondebosch Fountain lot. Drivers will buy cards to display and scratch out the relevant window for date and time of parking.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MBABANE (Swaziland) - Swaziland faces crippling strikes by both teachers and civil servants after their unions abandoned salary negotiations with the small kingdom's Government on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Swaziland National Association of Teachers (SNAT) and Swaziland National Association of Civil Servants (SNACS) withdrew from the talks after the government refused to budge on paying civil servants for the month they were on strike in 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1996 strike was called by Swaziland's Federation of Trade Unions (SFTU) to press government to democratize.  Teachers and civil servants joined it to press government to pay them an 18 percent salary increment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government refused however, offering only a 12 percent increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February, the SFTU called another national strike, which collapsed because both teachers and civil servants refused to support it. SNAT subsequently led a teachers mass meeting in March to approach King Mswati lll directly with their grievances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The King instructed Government to refund them the money withheld for the strike, because they had compensated by working during holidays to make up for &quot;lost time&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SNAT's success however soured relations with SNACS which claimed that they had been betrayed and therefore started separate negotiations with government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, SNACS and SNACS patched up their differences and presented a joint negotiating team to Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the meeting with Government representatives, SNAT president Meshack Masuku said teachers have also pulled out from the talks in solidarity with the claim for refund by civil servants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said they cannot continue with negotiations when their colleagues have an outstanding grievance. He said they have given government until Monday to pay the outstanding money, failing which, they will consider other options.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - The head of South Africa's most powerful investigation unit, Judge Wilem Heath slammed former Transkei military leader Bantu Holomisa on Monday for questioning the motives of his probe into possible irregular salary increases just before the 1994 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa charged two weeks ago that the unit was conducting a malicious and unsubstantiated vendetta against him for suggesting that he and his military council had irregularly increased their salaries by 20 percent just days before the 1994 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increase is allegedly costing the government R342 000 per month, indicating a potential R500-million loss over the past three years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charge, first printed in the Mail &amp; Guardian two weeks ago, follows an investigation by Heath's special unit which has reputedly already recovered or saved the government R10- billion through what it terms &quot;search and seizure&quot; operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heath told the M&amp;G on Wednesday that the unit, which has the same executive powers as a high court in civil matters, has also just uncovered additional information indicating that similar increases were approved for Transkei's public service commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not certain how much the additional increases is costing the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa emphatically denies the charges and insists that that Heath is serving &quot;political masters&quot; in an attempt to smear his name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the second time you have rushed into corespondence and make wild allegations without first establishing the facts ... I am far too busy to waste time on such an allegation,&quot; Heath said in a four page letter to Holomisa on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dismissing Holomisa's allegations as completely without foundation and of being highly insulting to both the unit and Heath in person, the letter accuses Holomisa of relying on &quot;negative views&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa in turn insists that his last promotion, from the rank of brigadier to major-general, had been in 1987 by former Transkei leader George Matanzima. Holomisa challenged Heath to publish documentation proving otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The issue is not really about a promotion as such, in the sense that he was not given a higher rank but rather a 20 percent salary increase just before the elections,&quot; said special investigation unit member, advocate Gerhart Visagie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The documentation we have, including an internal Transkei memorandum, indicates that Holomisa's salary, as the military council chairman, increased from R250 158 to R303 789.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The documentation also indicates that other Transkei leaders, including the president, twelve ministers, the auditor general, public service commission chairman and a number of paramount chiefs all received the same 20 percent increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have this proof but every time we investigate anything connected to Holomisa, he immediately reacts strongly,&quot; adds Visagie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Heath confirmed that the unit's investigation into Holomisa was not yet complete but stressed that he only needed one or two more statements and a couple of weeks before initiating civil action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Holomisa's response to this whole thing is once again very derogatory of both me and the unit. It is not the first time that he has reacted like this. In January of last year, he wrote me a letter out of the blue accusing us of being biased for investigating a house he bought in the Transkei,&quot; said Heath</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa insists that he retained his salary as a commander of the Transkei Defense Force, which includes standard tax deductible allowances, and that he has still not received his &quot;long overdue&quot; early retirement pension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa reportedly qualifies for the pension in terms of the 1978 Defence Act but the government still has to process and approve his application.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Mpumalanga Housing Board members continued to insist this week that they were never briefed about Motheo's R185-million housing project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amongst those questioning the scheme's approval is National Party representative, Jakkie van Heerden, who told Mail &amp; Guardian that the board was not informed about the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conceding that he had missed one board meeting in January, where Moodley claims that the scheme was discussed and approved by the board, Van Heerden said that according to the minutes of the meeting there had not been a quorum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minutes indicate that there were only six members at the meeting while a quorum would consist of at least eight members, he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only thing contained in the minutes of that meeting is that the executive committee wanted approval to allocate various stands to a rural developer. There was a description of the stands but no detail on Motheo or the scheme itself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Explaining the granting of rural housing had previously been prohibited because rural applicants seldom had a legal title deed to the land they wanted to build on, Van Heerden said he doubted that the necessary regulations and other ordinances had been drafted to allow for the scheme to be launched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I mean, there are loads of town councils and other bodies in the province just itching to provide housing for their rural or tribal trust residents. If these regulations existed, why has no-one else jumped in to take advantage,&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why have there been no public adverts or education campaigns to explain to rural residents how to qualify?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insisting that the council had never been fully briefed on Motheo, Van Heerden added that even when news of the &quot;massive&quot; scheme reached board members through other channels they had been unable to ask question about it because not enough members arrive at the board's last three meetings to constitute a quorum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only time we heard anything about rural housing was when Moodley gave a generalised verbal report to the board in November last year but no mention was ever made of Motheo of any similar scheme,&quot; said Van Heerden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The minutes of the meeting confirm this and in fact also prove that we ruled that while we are not against rural housing in any way, we felt it was important that any potential schemes be brought back to the board for full discussion before implementation or approval.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Heerden accused Moodley of &quot;talking nonsense&quot; for insisting otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the chairman of Mpumalanga's standing select committee on housing, Hein Mentz this week accused housing MEC Craig Padayachee of misinforming the committee about Motheo last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't know whether he consciously lied to us, whether he was misinformed or whether he simply did not know what was goring on in his department, but he definitely didn't give us the true facts on Motheo,&quot; Mentz told M&amp;G on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amongst the &quot;errors&quot; Padayachee made while testifying before the committee was his insistence that the Motheo scheme had been formally approved by the board on February 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was never a meeting on February 20 so it couldn't have been approved as he insisted, but this was just one of a string of such errors. There were just too many questions put to the department's heads that could not be answered,&quot; added Mentz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These included an annual report which did not balance by R4,5-million. According to Mentz, officials had to scramble for days before discovering that the funds were in a developer's trust account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we' hadn't noticed that the report didn't balance and hadn't asked about the figure, no-one would have known about this money just sitting there,&quot; explained Mentz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the amount of queries on both the department's annual report and proposed 1997/ 98 budget, a second standing select committee session will be held later this month. No date has yet been set for the hearing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MANZINI (Swaziland) - Royal Swazi Police have found slightly over three kilogrammes of dagga and 18 dagga 'trees' on a farm owned by Swaziland's puritan Prime Minister Sibusiso Dlamini.  The police confirmed on Thursday that they have arrested a 27-year-old labourer in connection with the find at the farm, which is about 20km north east of the commercial hub of the kingdom.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dagga is said to have been reported to the Prime Minister by workers who found the well developed shrubs growing on an isolated portion of the farm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to police, the &quot;furious&quot; Prime Minister immediately called the them and ordered a team to stake the area out and arrest those responsible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We swooped on the farm over the weekend and arrested the man who planted the trees after finding dagga on him He is expected to appear in court soon,&quot; said police spokesman, Sergeant Victor Dlamini.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dagga is often called Swaziland's gold because it is held in high esteem among international abusers who claim that it is one of the more potent varieties grown around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Growers are increasingly turning to modern farming technology and now use irrigation, fertiliser and pesticides to ensure rich harvests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since winter is the normal harvest season for the drug, police have been busy raising remote areas of the country and destroying the crop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sergeant Dlamini added that police raided five farms and destroyed huge quantities of dagga in May alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said police are intensifying their fight against both drug abuse, peddling and smuggling.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MBABANE (Swaziland) - An international friendly game between Swaziland's National team, Sihlangu, and Malawi next month will be scrapped if two influential Swaziland senators have their way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two, former Prime Minister Senator Prince Bhekimpi and Senator Walter Bennet insist that spending money on the national soccer team is &quot;investing in embarrassment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The senators point out that the Swazi national team has established a &quot;proud&quot; tradition of never making it beyond the preliminaries in international tournaments but stress that it is not only the ability of the team that irks them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swaziland's soccer administration they say, is in such a shambles it does not deserve public funds. The administration has been criticised for failing to collect gate takings properly.  Swaziland's once illustrious football industry, which produced the likes of Scara Thindwa, now Wits University Coach, Abel Shongwe, and Chief's long-time goalie William &quot;Cool Cat&quot; Shongwe as well as a host of others who graced the South African professional soccer league in the Eighties has lost most of its shine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a soccer country, the Kingdom was ranked 106th in the world by FIFA. Now it is number 163, well behind Namibia, Lesotho and even Botswana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not only the politicians who are voting with their feet. Even coaches are keeping a respectful distance these days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year, Thindwa, one of the celebrated soccer greats here, returned with great fanfare to coach Sihlangu against Mozambique. The squad started off playing a in polished style but disintegrated into a panic and were soundly thrashed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of the game, it was Thindwa who departed the Somhlolo stadium in a hurry, with unsportsmanly fans baying for his blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They blamed his game-style for the loss. He did not bother to stay long enough to explain but quit and returned to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His successor has not lasted either. Bizzah Mkhonta, a veteran of the national team has also quit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, the fund raising committee for the team also quit en-masse, complaining of poor management by the National Football Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cure from the Senators, is to switch off government funds for soccer. Maybe then, they say, things will cool down enough to find a solution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MBABANE (Swaziland) - Swaziland's former anti-corruption finance minister, Derek von Wissell, is poised to take the kingdom's top agricultural job as chief executive of the powerful Swaziland Sugar Association (SSA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Von Wissell, who recently resigned in protest from the government after he was transferred from finance to tourism, will take over from Andy Colhoun who left the Association at the end of his contract in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Von Wissell's transfer was linked at the time to his uncompromising stance on corruption and his exposure of leading royalty and politicians in the Swazi Bank scandal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sugar is the second largest revenue earner in Swaziland's economy after customs union receipts and the SSA plays an important role in both the government and private sector's economic policy process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An acknowledged successful businessman in the sugar business, Von Wissell became the chief of Natie Kirshs Swaki Group of companies before he was drafted into the Swaziland cabinet in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He served as minister for health, then finance before he quit in protest to his transfer to the relatively junior post of tourism - an act which soured his relationship with the Swaziland royal family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past few weeks, the Swaziland Sugar Association sought a replacement for long serving CEO Andy Coulhoun who retired last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Von Wissell was the preferred choice, he faced a huge hurdle - mending his relations with the King who was angered with his resignation from the cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Palace insiders however report that he has approached the King and apologised, which has cleared the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite having the sugar industry's full backing, Von Wissell still needed the King's blessing for the job because the Royal conglomerate Tibiyo TakaNgwane holds 40 percent in the sugar industry. Tibiyo reports directly to the King.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr von Wissell is a very popular figure in Swaziland, after exposing a free loan racket where prominent public figures in Swaziland gave themselves free loans from the Swaziland Development and Savings Bank, known as the Swazi Bank - thus leading to its collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As CEO of the sugar association, Von Wissell will be faced with the challenge of repairing relations between the South African Sugar Association which canceled links with Swaziland over market wars.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pretoria - The Reverend Frank Chikane, the Director-General in the Office of the Deputy President, Mr Thabo Mbeki, and Vice President and Pastor of the Apostolic Faith Mission of South Africa, has written a letter to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) inquiring as to whether or not anyone has applied for indemnity in respect of gross human rights violations perpetrated against him between January 1977 and June 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Revd Frank Chikane also wants to know whether or not anyone has made any disclosures relating to the issue raised above.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between January 1977 and June 1989 the Rev. Frank Chikane was detained several times without trial, brutally beaten and tortured. His Pimville, Zone 7 house was attacked with petrol-bombs and in 1989 he was poisoned with an organophosphate chemical.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter to Chikane dated 5 November 1996 the Minister of Safety and Security, Mr Sydney Mufamadi, said that Mr Paul Erasmus, who is alleged to have knowledge about the poisoning experience, was in the witness protection programme of the Department of Justice. The Deputy Attorney-General, Dr Pretorius, is also reported to have said that subsequent to the recent evidence by former Colonel Eugene de Kock the Attorney-General's Office had become &quot;aware of more names of possible witnesses and/or perpetrators who could assist in this investigation&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - National squad coach George Mungwa has assured to do the nation well when the team meets Bafana Bafana in group three of the World Cup qualifier this Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mungwa made the assurance after watching the squad yesterday afternoon in a training game against Zanaco in which the bankers forced for a one all draw at Independence Stadium.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We shall cross the bridge when we get there but what I can all say is that we shall do a nice job for the nation,&quot; Mungwa said ahead of the match that Zambia needs to win to brighten her chances to the World Cup finals in France next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mungwa is well aware, losing to the African champions will shatter the country's dreams of qualifying for the 32 nations World Cup competitions which kicks off in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The squad skipper Kalusha Bwalya though has a lot of respect for the African champions was optimistic Zambia will carry the day and probably lead the team to Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team leaves this afternoon for Johannesburg ending speculation that they might camp in a neigbouring country before the day of the game to keep away from the South African 'spies'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no need of camping elsewhere, we are going straight to South Africa,&quot; said Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) treasurer Musa Kasonka Jr. who is also expected to lead the entourage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bafana Bafana have only beaten Zambia once during the Nelson Mandela inuaguration cup since their return to continental competition following the end of apathied in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vice-captain Johnson Bwalya though regreting the earlier results of the games against Congo and Congo-Kishansa was now in top form than ever and promised to do his best to earn the country a passage to France.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The arrival of defence pillar from his Saudi Arabian club, Al Hilal will remain a secret until he joins the squad for the Sunday do-or-break World Cup qualifier encounter against Bafana Bafana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) treasurer Musa Kasonka Jr. in an interview yesterday said that it was better to keep the opponents guessing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Litana is definitely coming but I can't tell you when because I don't want South Africans to know our strategy,&quot; said Kasonka in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National stand-in coach George Mungwa also assured fans that Litana would join the squad before they leave for Johannesburg today although indications are that he will fly straight to South Africa tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team doctor Wesley Gondwe disclosed that all the players in camp were injury free including Andrew Tembo who joined camp on Monday following a knee injury that kept him from active soccer for almost a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the players are physically alright and fit for the match unless there are any other injuries,&quot; assured Gondwe in an interview Wednesday after watching team undergo strenuous training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The squad leaves this morning for Johannesburg by Royal Swazi and is expected to train tomorrow at the First National Bank (FNB) Stadium, the venue of the decisive encounter for France '98.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barker's consolation is that most of the players he used in the match they lost 2-0 will not be in his starting line- up.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - I recall what the Presi- dent said a few weeks ago about the informal sector and it's role in the development of a nation. President Frederick Chiluba was addressing the nation on Labour day in Kitwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What I found amusing was the little Freudian slip he made which made me realise that he had some kind of hang up about his educational background. There is one statement that he made which exposed an underlying inferiority complex on his part. It was rather painful to watch and I must admit that I squirmed through the whole incident.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement which made me nearly weep was the one that he made to the effect that he had been Chairman of an ILO Committee on the informal sector and &quot;not just some Zambian committee...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What did that statement mean? Are Zambian Committees inferior and lacking in some way? Can we not be proud of that which is Zambian ?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was left wondering if these were the same had made such a fuss about &quot;Zambia for Zambians&quot;. From Chiluba's statement it was quite clear that he was not for Zambia but for some outside international organisation. I suppose that if the President had been in charge of a Zambia Congress of Trade Union Committee on the informal sector he would have been ashamed to talk about it. I am sure that he would have buried this fact from the public as he does so well with so many genuinely unpalatable facts about his past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having heard Chiluba talk about how his knowledge about the informal sector was so advanced because it was not a Zambian committee that he chaired, I begun to understand more about our dear President. His driving force and inspiration also came into better focus as I realised that nothing in Zambia can inspire him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This probably explains why he had to twist the truth and pretend to the Commonwealth that he had been educated abroad!  This is the claim which he put into his bio data for the NewZealand Commonwealth meeting publication. Chiluba must have thought that the other leaders would think less of him if he admitted that he was educated in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having attended school in Musangu and at Mambilima Falls cannot be termed as being schooled abroad. Only foreigners would state that attending Zambian schools constitutes being educated abroad. Was Chiluba perhaps trying to tell us something?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hope that one of these days Chiluba will have another address to the nation where he will devote time to explain his education abroad. After all he did so well with the explanation over the &quot;O&quot; and &quot;A&quot; levels. We all still remember the famous &quot;ungraded pass&quot; explaination. For his studies abroad Chiluba can always tell us, at his next address to the nation, that in this day and age of the computer and internet he had been studying abroad in cyberspace. The Commonwealth office must be at a loss as to what to do to their publication containing Chiluba's bio data. I am certain that there will be a corrigendum in any subsequent reprints of the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the rate things are going I would not be too surprised if we next see Chiluba sporting an Eton or Cambridge tie. He could always borrow Lucy Sichone's Oxford tie so long as she promised not to tell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba's hang up over everything Zambian and indigenous has even led him into giving his children the most improbable names. What would have been wrong with Mulenga, Inonge or even Mabvuto for Castro? It certainly would have more meaning and relevance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This however could not be as we all have to know that Chiluba has an international flavour about him. The closest he got to home is with the name Patrice. Some say that infact with that one he came further than just too close to home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is in this light that we must look at Chiluba's statement regarding why we should listen to him over the issue of the street vendors. His years as chairman of the ILO special committee on informal sector taught him that street vendors are productive and are what we call the small scale industrial sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oh by the way Mr. President, the informal sector that the international organisations try to encourage are not street vendors and thieving peddlers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The informal sector referred to as being industry, productive and a spur to indus-trialisation would be activities like carpentry, back yard garages, blacksmithing or tailoring shops in the spare bedroom. These people produce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Someone hawking already finished goods imported from Thailand Taiwan or South Africa does not produce anything and does not in any way spur development and industry in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a pity that the President did not go to any local institutions such as Kabwe Trades or even sit on some local NGO's committee on the informal sector. Even the Tasinta group would have told him that to help people into being productive you do not give them cheap goods dumped from abroad to hawk on our streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hope that the ILO committee on the informal sector that Chiluba chaired has since changed it's outlook on the informal sector and what constitutes industry.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Sweden will only consider restoring Zambia's balance of payment support when there is political dialogue in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swedish Ambassador to Zambia, Kristina Svesson, speaking at the official launching of Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation's (ZESCO) national control centre yesterday said dialogue between the government and all the political parties was essential towards the development of a nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My country Sweden is supporting a political dialogue because in a democracy all parties must give their contribution to peaceful and prosperous development of the nation,&quot; Ambassador Svensson said. &quot;When we see this dialogue taking place we will consider to release our balance of payment support.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Svensson, however, commended Zambia on the strides taken towards good governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she was aware that there was goodwill towards the establishment of political dialogue by the government although the &quot;goodwill should be manifest in actions&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environment minister Suresh Desai, speaking at same function, said his government would remain committed to dialogue with opposition political parties to enhance development in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Liberal Progressive Front president Rodger Chongwe, in an interview yesterday said, there was no dialogue between the government and all stakeholders in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. Chiluba and his associates in the MMD talk about dialogue but they are doing nothing. Dialogue means talking to all political parties and cooperating partners but Chiluba is just talking to donors and not the Zambians. I am afraid he is holding the wrong side of the stick,&quot; Chongwe said.  &quot;What he must do is call all political parties and non- governmental organisations to discuss the rigged 1996 general elections and the shambolic and fake constitution so that we all come to a common stand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia Democratic Congress president, Dean Mung'omba, accused the government of lack of seriousness in implementing dialogue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There has been lack of seriousness by the government. All they just say in the press is that they want dialogue but do not put in place proper mechanism for dialogue. Dialogue is not just shaking hands and drinking tea and we will continue to pressure the players so that this issue is resolved,&quot; Mung'omba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Zambia Independent monitoring Team president, Alfred Zulu, said the government's claims of political dialogue was just political rhetoric.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government has not done anything to initiate political dialogue with stake holders. All what is being said about their commitment is just political rhetoric but they have not shown any direction in the issue except for President Chiluba's statement at the Africa Freedom Day celebrations,&quot; Zulu said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Musanzala MMD member of parliament, Levy Mumba, attending a three day SADC Trade workshop in Cape Town yesterday said Zambia has not benefited from the Trade protocol ever since the Maseru treaty which gave way to the birth of SADC was signed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will not ratify the protocol which was signed in Lusaka unless certain issues are resolved,&quot; Mumba said in an interview at Johannesburg International Airport on Wednesday.  &quot;The major problem are the countries such as South Africa, Namibia and Swaziland which are in SADC and the South African Customs Union (SACU). They enjoy certain rights which we non- SACU members don't. Hence making our goods less competitive in the region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that South Africa has an eye on the new Democratic Republic of Congo but warned that Zambia will make passage of South African goods bound from Zaire difficult if the foregoing is not sorted out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are several issues that we shall raise,&quot; Mumba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia is being represented by eight members of parliament, all of whom are chairmen of various parliamentary select committee's at the workshop which is being held in the Old Parliament chamber in Cape Town. The delegation leader is Foreign Committee chairman, Vernon Mwaanga - a self confessed drug-trafficker.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Electricity tariffs in the country will be increased over the next few years to enable Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO) to recover operational costs and make a &quot;modest profit&quot;, disclosed energy minister Suresh Desai yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Desai, officially opening the rehabilitated ZESCO's national electricity control centre yesterday, said the corporation had been operating at a loss because of uneconomic tariffs that it was charging for its services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The present electricity tariffs are highly sub-economic.  It will remain my ministry's policy to allow electricity tariffs to gradually rise over the coming few years to levels which allow the power industry in Zambia to recover cost to make a modest profit to ensure the self sustain ability of the industry,&quot; Desai said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Desai said the low tariffs had resulted in slow break down of the ZESCO infrastructure which was currently in dire need of overhaul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot continue to run the industry at loss and then expect foreign governments to foot the bill or the rehabilitation and expansion of ZESCO's infrastructure,&quot; Desai said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new centre would enable ZESCO to control their entire power transmission network from the headquarters in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swedish Ambassador, Kristina Svesson, said her country was happy to be associated with the project and was ready to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Svesson said her government had given ZESCO a grant of US$12 million for the project which included the up- grading of equipment, computerisation of the control centre and provision of expertise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Svesson further said Sweden's reason for assisting rehabilitate to the centre was to improve the control station to enable it give better control of the flow of electricity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the surplus of the generated electricity will be exported to neignbouring countries, the modernising of the control centre means more export income to Zambia. And that is indeed needed,&quot; Ambassador Svesson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZESCO, however, contributed K3 billion in local costs towards the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Energy Board chairman Rahel Selasini, however, said his board would help ensure protection of the consumer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although our board has just been constituted we will ensure that the consumers are not exploited and also at the same time that the energy provider does not go bust,&quot; Selasini said in an interview yesterday. &quot;We would like to see justifiable tariffs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Slowed growth in the Zambian economy has been forecast for this year following poor performance by the agricultural sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standard Chartered Bank Zambia, in the latest edition of its African Quarterly report on the performance of economies of countries in the region, Zambia would experience a drop in the growth of the agro sector by 12 per cent although expected investment in the mining sector is likely to make up for the fall.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In 1997, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is expected to slow to between four to five per cent, mainly because of the of the rebound factor in agriculture, which will have significantly less impact on the economy than last year,&quot; the Standard Chartered Bank Zambia report read in part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year the agriculture sector contributed largely to growth in GDP recorded after the country achieved a good harvest which accounted for 34 per cent growth of the sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this year the sector suffered adverse effects from delayed procurement and distribution of farming inputs coupled with prolonged rains which have resulted to poor yields.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Allegations that the Church of Barotseland has been turned into a political mouth piece are false, said spokesman Robertson Kalaluka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalaluka, reacting to press reports that some politicians have turned Church of Barotseland into a political platform and that it is intimidating members of the United Church of Zambia (UCZ) in a press release yesterday, said it was their wish to resolve the issue at a negotiation table.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said even though the Church of Barotseland was registered in March, this year it attained autonomous status in 1935, having been established by the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society (PEMS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UCZ reverend, Aggrey Mushole, was quoted as having made this allegation and was supported by Oscar Mutukelwa who said Church of Barotseland was a new church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalaluka said in 1965, Church of Barotseland voluntarily went into a union with the Methodist Church and the United Church of Central Africa in Rhodesia (UNCCR) to form UCZ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalaluka said the Church of Barotseland and the Methodist, however, having withdrawn from the union are working out modalities of sharing the jointly owned property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He explained that Church of Barotseland and Methodist Church jointly convened a meeting on May 28, 1997 with Synod officials with a view of doing this but they did not come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally, the likes of Reverend Mushole and Mr. Mutukelwa should refrain from wanting to resolve this matter of a serious nature through the press and should consider coming to a round table discussion,&quot; Kalaluka said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This failure by the Synod to show up has resulted in the other two to have the same meeting on June 18.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Reject President Frederick Chiluba's bribe given to you as salaries, Liberal Progressive Front chairman Rodger Chongwe advised Chief Justice Matthew Ngulube and other Supreme Court judges yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chongwe, in an interview yesterday, charged that the salary increments given to Supreme Court judges and other judges by President Chiluba were unconstitutional and they should not accept them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chongwe, repeating his call for President Chiluba to be impeached for violating the Laws of Zambia, challenged Chief Justice Ngulube to lead the way in not accepting the President's &quot;corrupt&quot; salary increments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Justice Ngulube is the chief judge in this country and I believe he will be the last person to accept remuneration which is not properly voted for by Parliament,&quot; Chongwe said.  &quot;I look forward to hear his comment on unconstitutional salary increments being recommended to the judiciary and those paid to the judiciary since August 1996 without approval from representatives of the people of Zambia.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chongwe, who maintained the salaries of constitutional offices under Zambia's laws requires that an appropriation bill be brought in Parliament which the president has not done, said President Chiluba has by-passed that twice in August, last year and May 28, last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know he wants to please judges but judges, as trained lawyers, must not be bought by politicians,&quot; Chongwe said.  &quot;All the salaries awarded in August and last week are unconstitutional. I hope the Chief Justice does not accept what is unconstitutional.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chongwe, who describes President Chiluba's actions on judges salaries as &quot;injudicious&quot;, hopes the bench will not compromise itself through the &quot;bribe&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If judges succumb to such injudicious conduct they will be compromising their professionalism and no-one will respect them,&quot; Chongwe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Party secretary general, Ludwig Sondashi, who like Chongwe is a practicing lawyer , also described the salary increments given to judges as constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Judges are constitutional office holders, it is wrong for the President to award them salaries without Parliament's approval in form of a Bill,&quot; Sondashi said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Chiluba's latest award was made on May 28, last week under the Judges (Conditions of Service) Act the new Cap 277 of the Laws of Zambia. Section 3 of this law gives power to the President to pay &quot;a judge such emoluments as he may by statutory instrument prescribe&quot; while section 12 (2) allows the President to &quot;make regulations prescribing the perquisites of office and other conditions of service including but not limited to the following - car loans, housing allowance, non-private practice allowance, funeral assistance and traveling on duty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 13 attempts to repeal parts of the Constitutional Emoluments Act which relate to salaries of judges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But lawyers interviewed say the Judges (Conditions of Service) Act is unconstitutional and that the salary increment contravenes article 119 (1) of the Constitution which states &quot;there shall be paid to the holders of to which this article applies such salary and such allowances as may be prescribed by or under an Act of Parliament&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And 119(5) specifies the offices to which 119(1) refers and these include the Chief Justice, the Deputy Chief Justice, judges of the Supreme Court, the Attorney General, judges of the High Court, the Investigator General, the Solicitor General, Secretary to the Cabinet and the Auditor General.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Professor Patrick Mvunga, who was leader of UNIP in Parliament when the Judges (Conditions of Service) Bill was debated between February and March last year, says he raised a lot of concerns about it at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Mvunga said he was worried that a constitutional matter was being taken away from Parliament and delegated to a statutory instrument for one man to decide at will salaries of judges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Mvunga further revealed that he had communicated these concerns to Vice-President Godfrey Miyanda as leader of the House but the Vice-President told him that &quot;the judges were in favour of this arrangement because it is not cumbersome&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is a statutory instrument an Act of Parliament. No. This Act is therefore unconstitutional,&quot; Professor Mvunga said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations - UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has recommended a follow-on mission for Angola after the expiry, at the end of June, of the mandate of the current United Nations Angola Verification Mission, UNAVEM III.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his report to the Security Council released on Friday, the Secretary-General recommended the establishment of the new mission as of 1 July for a period of seven months.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The operation would be known as the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola, or MONUA, for its Portuguese acronym, and would have headquarters in Luanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overall mandate of the follow-on mission &quot;would be to assist the Angolan parties in consolidating peace and national reconciliation, enhancing confidence-building and creating an environment conducive to long-term stability, democratic development and rehabilitation of the country&quot;. Structurally, the mission would have the Political Division, the civilian, police, human rights, military, and administrative components, as well as the information and interpretation sections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While noting the progress achieved so far in the peace process, the Secretary-General drew attention to the recent tensions in northern Angola. He suggested the holding of the &quot;long-overdue&quot; meeting between President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Dr. Jonas Savimbi inside Angola as soon as possible, to accelerate national reconciliation and the peace process in Angola.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - Small groups of about 50 to 100 refugees continue to arrive at the transit center in Mbandaka. UNHCR teams are combing the area, but are finding only a handful of refugees up and down the Congo river.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are about 400 refugees in Mbandaka awaiting to be airlifted to Rwanda. About 60 ailing refugees and 25 unaccompanied minors are scheduled to be flown to Rwanda today from Mbandaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, we received reports of a 17-year-old refugee girl raped by a soldier and the belongings of several others stolen at the transit center near the airfield at Mbandaka.  After the incidents were brought to the attention of authorities, the soldier alleged to have raped the girl was publicly flogged and the two other soldiers said to be involved in robbing refugees were jailed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Repatriation operations at the Karuba collection point near Goma remain were suspended following the killing of four refugees and a relief worker last week. We continue to discuss with the authorities resumption of operations in Karuba as soon as we get security guarantees. However, action on the killings has been stalled after several robbery incidents in Goma town against NGOs. These included a break in by armed men at the World Vision compound in Goma on Wednesday night, that prompted the withdrawal of its staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, our Goma office continues with repatriation operations in other parts of the region. On Saturday, we expect to airlift about 100 refugees from the Amisi area to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the beginning of the year, UNHCR has repatriated by land and by air a total of about 225,000 Rwandan refugees from ex-Zaire. This count includes 45,000 airlifted from Kisangani and Mbandaka and 5,000 from other areas in the eastern part of the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - We are concerned about the situation in our transit centre 20km outside of Brazzaville. Yesterday we were denied access to the camp by armed men who appeared to be either civilians or militia in civilian clothing. The incident happened amid fighting in the city between government forces and a militia which appears to be loyal to the former President.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 5,000 Rwandan refugees in the camp were due to receive a food ration yesterday obviously we were unable to deliver that ration. Also the current situation appears to put in jeopardy a repatriation airlift of some of the most vulnerable people from Bilolo to Rwanda which we hoped to begin over the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The total number of Rwandan refugees in Congo is around 18,000. The group at Bilolo was the first to be transported down by barge from areas between 400 and 800 km north of Brazzaville where Rwandan refugees have crossed from the Democratic Republic of Congo. The other 13,000 people are still in these northern areas in several concentrations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - The idea of taking water from the Congo River to supply Namibia's central areas, mooted by President Sam Nujoma at the Swapo Congress recently, will be considered by Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Congo River runs through former Zaire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the weekend President Nujoma said a pipeline could be built where the river entered the Atlantic Ocean to carry water to the Okavango River and onwards to the Eastern Water Carrier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the idea raised eyebrows in certain quarters as Namibia is currently trying to negotiate drawing an estimated 20 million cubic metres of water annually from the shared Okavango River - a project which would cost the country millions of dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Fry, deputy permanent secretary for Water Affairs, said the Congo idea would certainly be considered even if the Okavango pipeline link went ahead. Fry pointed out that the possibility of drawing water from the Congo was investigated a year ago and said the idea was not &quot;out of this world&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a lot of &quot;diplomatic work&quot; would have to be done first as the idea would involve a number of countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously this has to be studied carefully.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to the increase in the demand for water in the region, rivers in southern Africa such as the Zambezi and the Okavango were under pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fry said due to the volume of water in the Congo River, there was the added advantage of a bigger potential for the generation of hydro-electric power to pump the water through a pipeline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to President Nujoma, a pipeline to link the Congo River to the Okavango River would be less than 1 000 kilometres long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project, which could be implemented as a SADC initiative, would create jobs for unemployed Angolans and Namibians, noted the President.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bagani - The Kxoe tribal authority this week expressed alarm over the high number of children, some as young as 11-years- old, getting married and bearing children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Namibian also found that socio-economic hardships are forcing young Kxoe girls to give their bodies away for money or other material benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know of many cases in which 11-year-old Kxoe children are married and having children,&quot; senior induna of the Kxoe traditional authority in the western Caprivi, Tedius Chedau, told The Namibian on Sunday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chedau said these &quot;marriages&quot; are becoming so frequent among 12-, 13- and 14-year-old girls that eyebrows are not even being raised, and the poverty-ravaged community is doing nothing to stop the practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Kambuli, a teacher at the Kippie George Primary School who has lived in the area for seven years, said he knows of many girls who have got married at the age of 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The main reason they are interested in marriage is they want to survive,&quot; he commented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chedau, showed this reporter a number of minors who have already tied the knot, among them a skinny girl at a shebeen near Bagani, who would not look out of place in grade one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The drinking hole has gained notoriety for selling beer to minors.The young girl claimed she is &quot;happily married&quot;, although she was without her much older partner at the shebeen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another child bride, innocent-looking 14-year-old Regina Johannes, said she tied the knot late last year and is already five months pregnant. Lightly dressed in a white, polka-dotted top, Regina said her parents had frowned on her marriage, but she decided to go ahead anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is married to a builder, who is in his late 20s, from another region. The pregnant girl, who was attending school at Martin Ndumba Combined School, ditched her studies after her pregnancy became visible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannes however said that her marriage is not as rosy as she expected, and she is now thinking of deserting her husband, so that she can go back to school once she delivers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to current legislation the age of consent among girls is 16, and men can be charged with statutory rape if they have sexual relations with under-age girls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chedau said child brides are a new occurrence in the Kxoe community because in the past his tribe used to marry and have children in their mid-20s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A German researcher, conducting linguistic studies on the Kxoe in that area, said some Kxoe parents have approached him saying they want to get money from people who sleep with their minor children for several nights in a row.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The researcher, who preferred not to be named, said &quot;some parents have come to me complaining that their children are not being paid after having sex, with certain people&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He observed that the parents just want money as they are so poor and in many cases do not know the consequences of these sexual relationships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kxoe girls freely give their bodies away to strangers even for a bottle of beer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All these developments are being attributed to the economic hardships and poverty afflicting most of the Kxoe community.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - The Rainbow Project, a gay and lesbian rights organisation in Namibia, has lodged a formal complaint with the Office of Ombudsman about recent attacks on homosexuality by Swapo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Project, which lobbies for equal rights and opportunities for gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transsexuals, said they took strong exception to recent attacks by President Sam Nujoma and Swapo on their rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We feel that such remarks are a violation of the Constitution of the Republic of Namibia and contrary to the policy of national reconciliation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is disappointing that these statements were made by individuals and an organisation that professes to abhor discrimination and support democracy,&quot; the Rainbow Project said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They handed in the complaint on Wednesday &quot;to ensure that the rights and freedoms of all persons are protected as stipulated in the Constitution of the Republic of Namibia&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group quoted remarks made by Nujoma at a December Swapo Women's Congress meeting where he said all necessary steps had to be taken to combat foreign influences which were affecting the nation in a negative way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Homosexuals must be condemned and rejected in our society.  It is foreign and corrupt ideology ... and such elements are exploiting our democracy,&quot; he claimed.  &quot;Steps must be taken...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also attached a Swapo press release, issued in January, which supported Nujoma's statement saying it was &quot;a very wise step in the right direction&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Homosexuality deserves a severe contempt and disdain from the Namibian people and should be uprooted totally as a practice,&quot; the party statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The press release said they fully endorsed the Nujoma statement and treated an attack on him as an attack against the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Rainbow Project feels such attacks are an incitement to violence and discrimination against law abiding citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;History has shown that such remarks can lead to witch hunts and the degrading of human beings. After similar attacks made by President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe there has been an escalation of discrimination and violence against sexual minorities in that country,&quot; noted the project which was formed after the attacks.</SPAN></P>

One third of the firms produces exclusively original spare parts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks to the incentives that have been provided to encourage exports and the duty-free access to the European Union market, car components exports have increased significantly in the last 5 years and the coverage rate of imports reached an average rate of 55%. 80% of exports are made up of electrical and electronic systems and include clusters of cables, engine parts, filters, clutches, etc. The bulk of exports goes to the countries of the European Union (84% in 1995).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to the importance of this sector, the government set up 30 training centers for over 1000 skilled workers and technicians. Tunisia also has 6 engineering schools from which over 1000 students (12% women) graduated in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many international firms are established in Tunisia in partnership or sub-contracting projects. They include General Motors, Isuzu, NHK, Pirelli, Renault, Scania, Valeo, and Volvo.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA - The Minister of Agriculture, Dr. Seifu Ketema, has called on all citizens to contribute their share of effort at conserving the environment and natural resources. He said neglect in this area has accounted for the country's &quot;relative poverty and degradation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening the Conservation Strategy of Ethiopia Launching conference held yesterday at part of events marking World Environment Day, Dr. Seifu noted that the government's policy which was ratified last April &quot;has mounted us on a reliable first stage that would allow for improvements in the management of our natural resources and the environment.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister pointed out that as the policy cannot by it self work miracles, the general public is expected to make utmost effort towards its effective implementation. He also noted that, as opposed to old beliefs, the public should now grasp the fact that conservation and development need to go hand in hand and in an integrated way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from being endowed with landscapes of incomparable beauty and diverse natural resources, it was noted, Ethiopia is one of only 12 countries in the world with abundant biodiversity and its conservation efforts would thus be beneficial &quot;not only to ourselves but the world as a whole.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia has always actively participated in negotiations on, and ratification of, international conventions on environmental conservation and will continue to do so, Dr.  Seifu emphasized. Governmental and nongovernmental organizations and other institutions and individuals should take note of &quot;all these realities&quot; and undertake development activities by taking due consideration of environmental factors, the minister said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The General Manager of the Environmental Protection Authority, Dr. Teweldeberhan Gebregziabher, said on his part that World Environment Day should give everyone the opportunity to reflect on the environment and on the need for &quot;a solidarity of all people of the world&quot; to protect it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also noted that the launching of the Ethiopian Environmental Policy assisted to the government's commitment to the protection of the country's environment and that the preparation and approval of the policy was the result of careful planning and research lasting a fairly long period of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Teweldeberhan further noted that the conservation strategy of Ethiopia is a process that has evolved in light of periodic information exchange and that feedbacks and recommendations received in the process shouldn't be incorporated to update it. a representative of the OAU also stressed the need for environmental conservation world wide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference was later addressed by representatives of the Ethiopian Patriotic Association, youth groups and the Ethiopian former fuel wood carries women's associations who all dwelt at length upon the necessity or making every effort at conserving the environment. They noted that the legacy of past in environmental degradation and depletion shouldn't be passed onto the new generation which is expected to show utmost care for the bounties of nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Student youth groups sang songs appropriate to the occasion following which a symbolic tree planting ceremony within the precincts of UNECA was conducted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - One of the greatest foreign scholars of Ethiopia was a French nineteenth century traveller, Antoine d'Abbadie. A man of many parts, he has not received the acclaim to which he is entitled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Antoine d'Abbadie's father, Michel d'Abbadie, a Basque, left France at the beginning of the French Revolution of 1789, and married an Irish woman, Miss Thompson. By her he had three sons, Antoine (our traveller), Arnauld, and Charles, and three daughters, Elisa, Clia an Julienne. All six were placed in the care of a governess, and, living abroad as refugees, did not go to France until their parents' return there around 1820. That was five years after the Revolution had come to an end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is at the End of the Road?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young Antoine, who was born in January 1810, was brought up by the governess, who recalls that he always had insatiable curiosity about the unknown. Story has it that he once asked her, &quot;What is at the end of the road? &quot;A river&quot;, she replied.  &quot;And after the river?&quot;. &quot;A mountain&quot;. &quot;And after the mountain?&quot; &quot;I do not know; I have never been there&quot;, she answered. &quot;Well then, I will go and see&quot;, declared the precocious infant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Antoine was taught by his governess until the age of thirteen, when he was sent to school. Then, as previously, he was, it is said, always asking questions, always wanting to know about everything. He also displayed an easy mastery of languages, both ancient and modern. He passed his baccalaurat exams, with little difficulty, in 1827, after which he proceeded to University, at Toulouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Unknown or Little Known&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While at college he seems first to have conceived the idea of exploring central Africa, by way of Tunisia and Morocco. His reading of the famous eighteenth century Scottish traveller James Bruce caused him, however, to become more interested in the Eastern part of the continent. He was consumed with the ambition of studying what he considered the &quot;unknown or little known&quot; countries of the area: not only their languages, but more importantly their religions, political institutions and literature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His dreams of exploration were, however, interrupted in the autumn of 1828, when his parents moved to Paris. There he once more enrolled in University studies, and devoted himself to the study, first of law and later of science. He subsequently paid a short visit to Ireland, the country of his birth, and on one occasion there walked a distance of thirty-six kilometres in only four hours and ten minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Life Ambition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After that exploit he at last felt himself physically capable, as well as mentally ready, to fulfil his life's ambition, of embarking on his journey to Ethiopia. It was, however, unavoidably delayed, for he was invited by the French Academy of Sciences to undertake a mission to Brazil, to study magnetic occurrences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liq Atsqu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That scientific expedition concluded, Antoine, still only twentysix years of age, at last set forth for Cairo, in 1837, with his younger brother Arnauld, who was five years his junior. From Cairo the two young men crossed Egypt, and the Red Sea, and proceeded to the island port of Massawa, then the usual point of entry for Ethiopia. They then made their way to the country's capital, Gondar, where they received a warm welcome, on 28 May, from one of its greatest scholars, the redoubtable Ethiopian judge Liq Atsqu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Separation, and Reunion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two brothers then separated. Antoine travelled widely, carrying out many geodesic experiments, to measure the earth's surface. Arnauld, on the other hand, was introduced to one of the greatest Ethiopian lords of the time, Dajazmach Goshu, who allowed him to accompany his army into lands south of the Blue Nile. On one of these expeditions he travelled to the source of the river, which, as far as is known, had up to then been visited by only two other Europeans: the Spanish Jesuit Pero Pais, in 1630, and the Scottish traveller James Bruce, in 1770.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After almost two years in Ethiopia, Antoine returned to Massawa, where he met his brother Arnauld, who arrived only three hours late for an appointment made twenty months earlier!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Return to Gondar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After exchanging information on their respective journeys, and exploits, the two brothers planned a second expedition to Gondar. This ran, however, into difficuties, at first because of local opposition en route, and later because Antoine's rifle misfired, wounding him in one eye. He was obliged to go for treatment to Aden and Cairo, and, on his return from Aden, was subjected to much harrassment from the British governor of Aden, the terrible Captain Haines, who considered him a French secret agent. Antoine nevertheless proved himself indomitable, and duly made his way back to Gondar, in June 1842, while Arnauld returned to his lordly friend Dajazmach Goshu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The d'Abbadie brothers, sometimes together and sometimes separate, now travelled all over the country. By then fully adjusted to Ethiopia, they wore local dress, and walked and rode barefoot. Antoine, who adopted the Ethiopian name Mika'el, i.e. his father's name Michel, was popularly referred to in and around Gondar by the Ethiopian title mamhir, or church scholar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enarya, and Kafa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Antoine's travels now took him to the then little known kingdom of Enarya, south of the Blue Nile, where he was kindly received by its notable ruler, Abba Bagibo, to whom he showed several of his most interesting chemical and other experiments.  The monarch, who was then allied to the ruler of the nearby kingdom of Kafa, arranged for Antoine to proceed to that territory, about which scarcely anything had yet been written in the scholarly world. Both rulers hoped to keep the Frenchman in their respective domains, but he refused to stay, and soon made his way northwards to Gondar. There he entered into the company of the city's church scholars, who showed him their manuscripts, and helped him study them, and have them copied.  He also spent much of his time on a careful linguistic investigation of the Amharic language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tawalda Madhen and 'Abd Allah</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These and other investigations kept both d'Abbadie brothers in Ethiopia until the end of 1848, when they left the country for good, taking with them two Ethiopians: Tawalda Madhen, a scholar from Gondar, and a Muslim called 'Abd Allah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scholar ship</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having spent twelve years in the country, and taken literally thousands of pages of notes (most of them now available at the Institute of Ethiopian Studies library, on microfilm) the two brothers were by then exceedingly well informed about all things Ethiopian. Antoine, beside carrying out numerous scientific investigations, had collected vocabularies of some thirty Ethiopian languages, containing over 40,000 words, and had assembled the largest library of manuscripts in the classical language, Ge'ez, or Ethiopic, ever collected outside the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Antoine's departure from Ethiopia, in 1848, was a great turning point in his life. Though he never returned to the country he had come to love, he continued to spend most of his time on its scholarly investigation. In these researches he was immensely helped by his assistant, Tawalda Madhen, who was well versed in classical Ge'ez as well as the vernacular tongue, Amharic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the decades which followed Antoine d'Abbadie wrote studies on a wide range of scientific, ethnographic and linguistic subjects. These included an account of thunder in Ethiopia, a description of the country's ancient coins, a detailed catalogue of the Ethiopic manuscripts he had collected, and memoirs on the Bilen and Galla, or, as they are now more often called, Oromo, peoples, among both of whom he had dwelt. He also began a translation of the Futuh al-Habasha, a sixteenth century history of the wars of Ahmad ibn Ibrahim, better known as Ahmad Gragn, which was later completed by the Austrian scholar Philipp Paulitschke. More important than any of these works was, however, d'Abbadie's invaluable Amharic- French dictionary, the Dictionnaire de la langue amaria, for which he will always be remembered. It appeared in Paris in 1881.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eclipse of the Sun</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia was not, however, our traveller's only scholarly interest. He was a keen astronomer, who travelled to Norway in 1851 to witness a total eclipse of the sun. He also devoted much of his energies to the study of his paternal language, Basque, and over the years wrote several pioneering studies on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chateau d'Abbadia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also built a fine residence, the Chateau d'Abbadia, in the Basque country, near Hendaye, in Southern France. He later bequeathed this building, which is still extant, to the French Academy of Sciences, as an observatory. It is decorated with several paintings depicting Ethiopian scenes, and its entrance hall contains a wooden statue of Antoine's Muslim Ethiopian colleague 'Abd Allah. The latter, it is interesting to recall, had fought, under Napoleon III, in the battle of Magenta against the Austrians in June 1859, and had later joined the Paris Commune of 1870. He was, sad to say, one of the many Communards shot in the ensuing savage repression of 1871.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Antoine himself, by then a much honoured, and highly respected, scholar, died on 19 March 1897, at the ripe old age of eighty eight.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Ethiopia's own Haile Gebreselassie set yet another world record by running two miles in eight minutes 1.08 seconds in Hengelo, Holland on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the race, he was made an honourary citizen of the Dutch town in recognition of his talent and his annual attempts to set world records there.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 24-year-old Haile is the current world record holder in the 5000 meters, both indoors and outdoors, and was the 1995 world-record holder in the 10,000 meters. He has won gold medals in the 10,000 meters at the 1993 and 1995 world championships and at the 1996 Olympic Games. Haile missed out on a $1 million payout in Saturday's race by not breaking the eight-minute barrier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I actually feel more than a million dollars. The money is not important. I can get it in the future,&quot; said the far from disappointed runner. He will now set his sights on regaining the world record in the 10,000 meters currently held by Algeria's Salah Hissou. Compatriot Assefa Mezgebu, a training partner of Haile, won the 10,000 meters in the same meet, taking nearly 40 seconds off his previous best for the distance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Being an architect is a thing of luxury in Ethiopia, thinks Ato Yoseph Taye Tarekegne, aged 26, while talking of the position architects occupy in the general scheme of things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yoseph feels the field of architecture needs improvement in our country due to the misconceptions and misunderstanding people have of the field. It is a field which enables one to get involved in real practical problems and solutions creation.  It also incorporates viewing of one's presentations from different angles and moreover having responsibility in the society.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yoseph was a child when he first started to think in architectural terms. His father, Ato Taye Tarekegne, with a bent of the artistic greatly influenced Yoseph in his chosen career. Even as a child he liked to sketch building and wished to see them come to realty. Having completed his ESLCE exams with great distinction, the road was open for him to pursue his chosen career. He joined the Addis Ababa University, Technology Department in 1989, and graduated with a B.Sc in Architecture and Urban planning in October 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talking of the position his field of work occupies in his country, Ethiopia, the society feel that an architectural work is related to art so it is given a secondary position in relation to the primary needs such as food and clothing. But Yoseph sees architecture as one the primary needs, that is shelter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interesting was his graduation project of final year when he presented a proposal of a mixed use development project of 15 stories high building right adjacent to Adwa Square, Piazza. He is a one of the few fortunate young architects who saw their proposals come to a fruitful end. The Midroc Construction is planning to construct a multi-user building in the same area having a similar scheme of project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his short career up to now, Yoseph has undertaken a wide range of architectural activities in projects such as day care centres, clinics, schools, offices and various community buildings, and private houses as well as multi use building and hotels projects in Nazareth, Dilla, Woldia and of course Addis Ababa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reminiscing of his university life, he feels his education in the field helped him later on to handle challenging jobs.  While he was still in the university, various proposals such as upgrading and low cost housing, a cafeteria for the swimming pool in Ghion Hotel, an industrial project for Tabor Ceramic processing, theatrical building among others were put before him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yoseph laughingly said the thing that most attracting to architecture was this ability to see an immediate result of his work. There is nothing like the feeling of satisfaction when one sees one's proposal built literally in bricks and stones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a big &quot;But&quot; he says. In his experience, there is a vast difference between what he created in his mind and the realisation of that proposal. It is greatly frustrating to see one's work completely wiped out because of a misunderstanding or misconception of what the architects has in mind. The misunderstanding can be caused for various reasons: the most important being practical limitations. Yoseph good- humorously acknowledge that architects are voiceless of imagination and might not sometimes give importance to the practical limitations say the engineer or a constructor might face while implementing the ideas the architect proposes. The practical limitations might be building materials or lack of capital. One must not forget that Ethiopia is still a poor country that is yet to Carter fully to the needs of building materials. Added to these, the society was not fully exposed to the various alternatives available in the field of architectural works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite these facts, Yoseph strongly feels there is a chance to innovate. Society is limited by &quot;conventions&quot; that are not transcending these limitations. And ways to do that is to expose the society of various creative, well thought out architectural works. Sadly, Yoseph quoting one of his instructors said Ethiopia, particularly Addis Ababa has&quot; &quot;many buildings but not many works of architecture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the limitations present in a poor country like Ethiopia, there are not much of innovative architectural designs being created by the architects of our times. Just by looking at few building constructed or being constructed in the many Ethiopian cities and towns, one can easily note the faithful copying of certain architectural motifs, particularly of those having spiritual connotations. A good example was the tip of the Axum obelisk present at most of the newly built sky scapers. Yoseph also feels architects should work, strive hard to get out of this use of conventions by either handling them creatively or completely changing them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aim to create an architectural style that speaks for itself is burning in Yoseph's mind. He feels Ethiopia is poor in architectural giants in sharp contrast to Europe and America. His mission in life will be to develop such style so that the next generation will have some Ethiopian base to start from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yoseph also recommends an initiation of a societal group for the innovative and creative minds of young architects. Like the many western countries, Ethiopia also should present its public with various alternatives while building its cities and towns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yoseph is at present not married, and is working as freelance and in collaboration with others in architectural designs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Since the promulgation of the proclamation concerning inventions, minor invention and industrial designs two years ago, the Ethiopian Science and Technology Commission was said to have accepted 50 patent applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Ato Getachew Mengiste, head of the Patent, Technology Transfer and Development Department, said the applications concern industrial applicable inventions and designs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Two prosecution witnesses testified on Tuesday before the Federal High Court saying the killing of a minor caused a mother to die of deep sorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the hearing of the testimony against former Derg officials, one of the witnesses told the First Criminal bench that a minor aged 7 was among the victims who were forced to sing praises to the revolution on March 1978.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The youngsters, attending a meeting in which Tesfaye Gebre- Hiwot, chairman of the then Higher 16 and his accomplices were presiding were killed at the spot. The witness testified that he saw the corpses of the minor and others thrown on the streets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another witness, a mother of one of the imprisoned youngsters, said she saw her son crawling from the torture he had undergone at the prison. She also testified that another mother of one of inmates went mad when she heard the shocking news of death of her child. The mother was said to have died of deep sorrow later on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnessing of the ordeal he faced in the prison of Kebele 15 Higher 21 in 1978, another witness said he broke his leg when his torturers made him fall from the rope he was hanging to a trough filled with boiled water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A mother of an inmate is still learning to cope with the shock she experienced after learning of the death of her son.  She was given his belongings at the day she was expecting him, the witness said. Previous to the news, the mother was told by a cadre to make a feast to celebrate the release of her son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness also named Professor Ambaye of the Addis Ababa University among the inmates who were killed at that time. The professor was said to have shouted when they took him out of his cell &quot;How dare you kill me for voluntarily coming to serve my country?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another witness said his son was killed during the Red Terror period even after he has made him register in the then political school with the intention of saving his life. He said he implored Captain Legesse Asfaw to save his son but he as well as Captain Engidawork Mamo allegedly were responsible for his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court had so far heard the testimony of 303 prosecution witnesses.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - In a recent vacancy announcement (&quot;Addis Zemen&quot;, Ginbot 20, 1989 E.C.) by the administration of Region 3 for the various government institutions located within its territory, the largest number of recruits required is for persons trained in economics, with 163 invited to apply out of a total planned recruitment of about 513.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accounting is in second place with 106 recruits required, distantly followed by management (48), educational administration and pedagogy (38), statistics (28), civil engineering (24) and language and literature (16). Other professions which are also in relatively significant demand are law (11), architecture (9), sanitary engineering (9), sociology (7) and geography (6). By contrast, low recruitment demand is reflected for electricity, animal science, plant science, biology, mechanical engineering, hydraulics, hydrology, geology, geophysics, history, psychology, physics, chemistry, political science, agricultural engineering, agronomy, public administration and electronics (see details below).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The personnel recruitment is intended for the regional council, education bureau, investment office, water, mining and energy development bureau, trade and industry bureau, civil service, culture, tourism and information bureau, high court, audit, labour and social affairs bureau, transport and communications bureau, Bahir-Dar Rural Technology Development Center, public works and urban development bureau, planning and economic development bureau, justice bureau, sports commission and health bureau. Hence, practically the whole civil service organisational structure in the region is covered by this latest personnel recruitment programme. Monthly salaries offered range from 420 birr to 1,290 birr.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of observations could be made from the above facts and figures. First, generally the government appears to continue being the biggest employer of professionals, indicating that, far from being rolled back, the functions of the state are still expanding at a significant pace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, although such large-scale recruitment by local governments is expected to alleviate the overall unemployment problem in the country, it is doubtful whether the recruited professionals will be able to make concrete contributions in the absence of conducive national economic and other policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, state personnel recruitment of the scale shown here and at the low salaries indicated, if fully implemented, is a sign that job opportunities in the private sector are limited, which means that the state sector is expanding at the expense of the sector which is, in policy terms, supposed to be the primary motive power of the national economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourth, while policy and practical development contributions of economists in terms of overall economic policy-making, project analysis, appraisal, market studies and the like are to be appreciated, the priority given to economics in the recruitment over such more directly productive professions as civil engineering, surveying, electrical engineering, architecture, mechanical engineering, hydraulics, sanitary engineering, auto mechanics, agricultural engineering, agronomy, town planning and electronics indicates a somewhat unhealthy bureaucratic bias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifth, the low planned recruitment level for animal science, plant science, biology, hydrology, geophysics and chemistry points to a low degree of emphasis placed on research and development at the regional level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sixth, while the relative importance attached to sociology should be appreciated, the role of psychology should be equally recognised ( a nation's development programme could be undermined by a lack of understanding not only of sociological but also of psychological problems of the society concerned).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seventh, why the importance of computerization is underemphasised in the recruitment project in the face of a growing national consciousness of the importance of information and information processing is not quite clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eighth, history and political science also do not seem to have been accorded their due share, especially when considered against the country's political background where politics seems to be in the driver's seat and even history may be rewritten to serve it!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ninth, other important professions including medicine, agricultural engineering, agronomy, town planning and electronics have been slighted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a whole, professions such as economics and accounting have been accorded rather too much attention whereas highly productive disciplines such as civil, mechanical and electrical engineering do not seem to have received their due share of priority; furthermore, the nearly total neglect of computerization is worrisome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, why it is difficult to realise the importance of formal training in political science, when this is perhaps the only way to make &quot;politicians&quot; in Ethiopia aware of the complementarity of the professions, is not at all clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A person versed in political science would be better able to appreciate the importance of the other professions in buttressing political power with concrete social and economic achievements than a person without such training. Similarly, a person without such knowledge and experience would be more likely to act out of a crude lust for power!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could a rough rule-of-thumb be worked out for a balanced recruitment of professionals for the civil service? This may sound like a rather difficult proposition, but an attempt could be made on the basis of the major civilian functions of the state in a market-oriented economy which include a) maintaining law and order, b) fiscal and central banking, c) providing basic economic and social infrastructure and amenities d) formulating social and economic policies conductive to private enterprise and e) conducting relevant research and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out of the total 36 disciplines listed in the table above, 10, or about 28 percent, belong in the social sciences.  However, taking into account only the four major disciplines, namely engineering, health, education and law, which are required in the provision of services not only to groups but also to individuals, the degree of importance that would be attached to the social sciences would be roughly 40 percent, the remaining and larger portion of 60 percent being slated for the natural and applied sciences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, even counting accounting as belonging in the applied sciences, slightly over 56 percent of the total number of the planned recruits shown above are intended for the social sciences, thus indicating an imbalance in personnel recruitment in Region 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even more pertinent issues on the Region's planned employment plan may be raised regarding the availability of manpower with the required academic qualifications and work experience (up to ten years in some cases), the actual quality of these qualifications and experience and the practical contributions the personnel sought are expected to make in bringing about social and economic transformation in Ethiopian society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Region 3 succeeds in recruiting all the manpower according to its specifications, it is going to be mostly at the expense of other government institutions, although this statement may have to be qualified if recruitment from the ranks of the retired is to take place. For the Region's recruitment programme to contribute to the creation of new employment, either other government institutions should be willing to take on fresh graduates (i.e. with no experience ) or Region 3 itself should relax its recruitment conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other general issues that may be raised are: what practical, tangible contributions can, for example, an economist or a statistician make? Are the economists to be recruited capable of designing a practical overall development and projection model ? Can they conduct practical project feasibility and appraisal studies of acceptable standards?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assuming that they are able to successfully undertake such assignments, are the government's overall economic policies conductive to the implementation of such growth models and feasibility studies? Are the statisticians to be recruited going to be in a position where they will have enough statutory authority to enforce compliance with data and information requests from relevant government and private institutions and entities, and will they have enough funding to carry out, for example, statistical surveys as may be required? In other words, when a statistician is put on the payroll under the recurrent expenditure, funding for, say, a statistical survey project would be required under the capital expenditure! Has such fiscal expenditure dove-tailing been attempted while working out the region's personnel recruitment scheme?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, it is a good thing that no such statement as &quot;priority will be given to ethnic members of the Region&quot; is contained in the vacancy announcement, but as Region 3 is a recidivist ethnic gerrymander, there is still a possibility that an applicant may be required to be an ethnic of the Region (if indeed there is such a thing!) when he or she phones, as advised,&quot; for further information and clarifications on 20-14- 42&quot;! It would be interesting to call Bahir Dar and find out otherwise!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - A statement issued by the Ethiopian Human Rights Council (EHRCO) called the government's May 1 sealing of business premises, revoking of licenses and detention of businessmen illegal and a violation of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EHRCO called on the government to &quot;take the necessary steps to release the detained businessmen, open the business premises sealed by force, and reverse the decision to revoke and/or take away trade licenses from the businessmen.&quot; It further urged &quot;all supporters of human rights to do their utmost to stop the injustices done to the businessmen in Addis Ababa.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement recalled that on May 17, businessmen closed down their shops and held a protest rally at Mesqel Square in response to a rent increase as high as 40,000% imposed by the Addis Ababa Administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The businessmen went on strike on May 19 after the rally failed to draw the attention of the authorities. Around noon of that day, the government issued an ultimatum that those businesses not open by 3:00 p.m. would be sealed; and, immediately following the deadline, kept its word by sealing over 1000 shops without a court order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case of 200 of those shops is still under review. Some will open soon, according to Head of Region 14 Trade, Tourism and Industry Bureau Ato Estifanos Senbeta; but 29 licenses have already been cancelled. According to city administrator Ato Ali Abdo, 84 persons who are thought to have co-ordinated the strike were detained and will not be pardoned. Those participating in the strike were allowed to reopen their shops on condition that they admit they had committed an offense by going on strike and appeal for a pardon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement pointed out that &quot;there is no provision in Ethiopian laws that bans protests in the form of closing down one's own business premise&quot;, and that a trade license may be revoked only according to strict guidelines, none of which was broken in the present situation. The statement further recalled that the practice of forcing citizens to admit to committing an offense and appeal for pardon whenever they used their right to protest follows a consistent pattern. Last month, Addis Ababa University students were rounded up by police and tortured after staging a demonstration about which they had informed the government in advance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The students were released after being forced to admit that they had committed an offence, pledge that they would never again participate in such a demonstration and sign an application form requesting a pardon.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - It is expected that, when the Eritrean monetary authorities commence, as recently declared, their currency change programme, they will announce the rate of conversion of the &quot;Nakfa&quot; (the name of the new currency) vis-a- vis the Ethiopian Birr which they have heretofore been using as their legal tender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also anticipated that the rate of exchange between the Eritrean Nakfa and the US Dollar will be made public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since there are many Eritrean traders who have been using the Birr to import Ethiopian products such as &quot;teff&quot;, coffee, leather, wood, etc., into Eritrea for commercial purposes, such traders, and in fact, many other Eritrean individuals, may not want to convert all of their Birr holdings into Nakfas which, it is anticipated, will not be acceptable in Ethiopia. So the wise thing to do from the point of view of the individual interests of such Eritreans would be to start converting before the start of the Eritrean currency change scheme at least part of their Birr holdings into US dollars which, of course, are readily acceptable both in Ethiopia and Eritrea.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They could do this on the dollar black market in Ethiopia as the dollar black market in Eritrea would no longer be willing to accept Birr for US dollars in the wake of the introduction of the Nakfa, as Birr cash transfers across Ethiopian borders from Eritrea in the near future would presumably begin to be strictly controlled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another option would be to transfer that part of their Birr holdings which they do not want to convert into Nakfas to Ethiopia across the border, which, as pointed out above, is at present quite porous, and bid for foreign exchange on the Ethiopian weekly foreign exchange auction market and obtain US dollars for the importation of goods from outside the Birr area and take the imported goods to Eritrea across the border which again is only very loosely controlled with respect to commodity transfers to Eritrea. Still another alternative for these kinds of traders would be to buy Ethiopian goods such as teff, coffee, etc., in Birr before the currency conversion begins and transport them to Eritrea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of these imported products may be re-exported for foreign exchange. Further, Eritreans now living in Ethiopia who wish to transfer cash to Eritrea for whatever reason are likely to do so after converting Birr into US dollars on the black market, for it is quite possible that they may be treated as foreigners after the introduction of the Nakfa for foreign exchange transfer purposes as well as for other matters involving the question of citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other two possibilities of buying Ethiopian products such as coffee and leather and transporting them to Eritrea and bidding for foreign exchange on the foreign exchange auction market for re-export to Eritrea may also be taken advantage of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, there are allegations that some departments of the Eritrean state bureaucracy may have encouraged the conversion of Birr holdings of government financial and other institution into US dollars on the Ethiopian dollar black market. The allegations ring plausible as especially all the Birr holdings of the Eritrean central bank and commercial banks there are to be handed over to the National Bank of Ethiopia which has so far been the sole bank of issue for the Birr area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as repercussions of the Eritrean currency change on the Ethiopian economy are concerned, one general observation that could be made is that no major negative consequences need be expected if the currency change is carried out systematically and in accordance with best-practice procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All Ethiopian currency (including coins) now held by Eritrean individuals, government organisations, financial institutions and private businesses is ultimately to be handed over to the Ethiopian monetary authorities and be replaced by the new Eritrean currency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is quite conceivable that a sort of bilateral payments arrangement may be put in place to finance trade between Ethiopia and Eritrea in their respective domestic currencies up to a certain agreed limit. This option, however, many not be particularly favourable to Ethiopia at the moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, deviations from best-practice currency change procedures on the part of the Eritrean monetary authorities could have several adverse consequences on the Ethiopian economy. Some of the irregularities that may be allowed to occur have been outlined above. If, for example, financial institutions in Eritrea somehow deliberately release a large quantity of Birr onto the Ethiopian market immediately before the commencement of the currency change for conversion in into US dollars on the Ethiopian dollar black market and possibility on the official forex auction market, the birr/dollar exchange rate may depreciate to a destabilizing degree and the action may also cause inflationary pressures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, allowing a large quantity of Birr to cross over the border into Ethiopia for the purchase of Ethiopian products which may then be trucked or otherwise transported to Eritrea, would cause both inflationary and exchange rate problems for Ethiopia. In this respect, it is rather strange that the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) has reportedly accumulated large claims on Eritrean banks in terms of Birr credits extended in the recent past through a correspondent account.  News of the imminent currency change in Eritrea should have alerted the CBE to restrain credit extension to banks in Eritrea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At any rate, these credit claims of the CBE on the Eritrean banking system will have to be settled in Birr before the planned currency change in Eritrea. If they are not settled before the currency change, the CBE will have no choice but to demand settlement in hard currency, preferably US dollars, which the Eritrean banking system would find difficult to comply with .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The anticipated currency change in Eritrea will complete the secession of the region from Ethiopia. Hence, existing trade, economic and financial arrangements between the two states would have to be reviewed in the context of these new would-be developments. Ethiopian exports to and imports from Eritrea would have to be subject to Ethiopia's customs and exchange control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, Birr transfers to and from Eritrea would be illegal except the permitted amount for persons travelling abroad. With the possible exception of financing bilateral trade in goods and services in each other's currencies under a probable bilateral payments agreement, settlement for commercial transactions between the two states would be all in foreign exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, exports of, say, coffee, leather, and oilseeds to Eritrea would be received not in Birr as is the case now, but in US dollars. Similarly, the Eritrean authorities would demand payment in foreign exchange for oil- refining, port services and salt exports. As the Eritrean population residing in Ethiopia is large, the Ethiopian monetary authorities would be hard pressed to grant it full foreign exchange remittance privileges equal to those granted to non-Eritean foreigners. Doing so would imply a massive foreign exchange remittance outflow which Ethiopia can ill afford. However, remittance privileges may be given to Eritreans living in Ethiopia on a selective basis.  For example, Eritreans who bring in foreign exchange for investment purposes and those engaged in work involving considerable technical and scientific know-how such as auto- mechnaics, civil engineering and specialised medicine may be slated for remittance privileges. An alternative would be to give such Eritrean investors and personnel the privilege of exporting Ethiopian-produced products such as &quot;teff&quot; and coffee against payment in Birr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, what may be some of the major steps that the Ethiopian monetary authorities would take in preparation for the planned Eritrean currency change? The following measures are expected:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strict customs and foreign exchange control, particularly the prohibition of Birr transfers from Eritrea immediately before and during the period of Eritrea's planned currency change, which measure must continue after the currency change; Stricter surveillance of the activities of the foreign exchange black market in Ethiopia, with the possibility of a crackdown on it should the Birr depreciate to a destablizing degree; Settlement of CBE's net claims on the Eritrean banking system before the currency change; Estimation of the quantity of Ethiopian currency (i.e. currency outside banks and currency within banks) in Eritrea that must be handed over to the National Bank of Ethiopia after the currency change in Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The Secretary-General of the Pan African Movement (PAM), Tajudeen Abdul-Raheem says there is a possibility Swiss banks have deliberately under-estimated the value of ousted Zairean dictator Mobutu Sese Seko's assets in order to protect the West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abdul-Raheem told guests at a public lecture here on Thursday night that previous estimates traced by an independent journalist exceeded 4.8 billion Swiss francs (3 billion U.S. dollars) worth of assets held by Mobutu.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Democratic Republic of Congo President Laurent-Desire Kabila has said Mobutu has 11 billion Swiss francs or one billion dollars in foreign banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amount exceeds the country's gross domestic product. Meanwhile, Tajudeen Abdul-Raheem has said there is need for Africans to build their own democratic institutions instead of relying on the West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do not take lessons from these Westerners who act like they were born democratic,&quot; he said at the lecture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Democracy is a process that takes time to develop, so Africa has to go through its own stages based on its own experiences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PAM is a grassroots organisation which seeks to restore to Africans what they lost as a result of the injustices they suffered at the hands of the West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abdul-Raheem also said the remaining dictators in Africa should draw lessons from the experience of the Democratic Republic of Congo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The political climate in Africa is changing as people are beginning to challenge existing systems,&quot; he told the 100 guests. &quot;Zaire has proven that no dictator in Africa will ever be safe again. So dictators beware.&quot; Laurent Kabila, leader of Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (Zaire), forced dictator Mobutu Sese Seko to flee into exile last month after he had plundered the wealth of the mineral rich central African state for 32 years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Emeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, the ex-Biafra warlord, who led the abortive secessionist bid by Eastern Nigeria, has criticised those campaigning for the country's military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha to succeed himself, saying it is the turn of the Igbos to present the next civilian president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whatever is the present campaign, schemings or activities for the country's president in the emerging political dispensation, let it be clearly known that it is now the turn of the Igbos (Eastern Nigeria) to produce the next president of the country and it is not negotiable,&quot; Ojukwu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been a raging campaign by a cross section of Nigerians, including some Igbo elements, urging Abacha, who took power in November 1993 from a lame-duck civilian administration, to shed his military uniform and run for presidency under his political transition programme, scheduled to end in October 1998.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaigners have included cabinet ministers, serving military officers and pressure groups. The crusade has continued despite repeated denials by officials disociating government from it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political observers say Abacha's failure to clarify the situation has only fuelled the speculation after he said in a recent interview the decision to succeed himself was for his &quot;constituency&quot; to make.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ojukwu, speaking at a fund-raising for the Igbo cause in the eastern city of Enugu on Thursday, said the Igbos had been &quot;locked up in the room&quot; for too long, they should &quot;come out to the parlour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was a reference to the alleged marginalisation of the Igbo ethnic group since the 30-month Biafra war ended in 1970. That war pitted the igbos and others in Eastern Nigeria against the rest of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ojukwu's political leadership of the Igbos has come under strong challenge, with some critics accusing him of misleading the East into a war that killed an estimated one million Igbos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ex-Biafran leader said the Igbos must now unite to take their destiny in their own hands otherwise they risked remaining the underdogs in the Nigerian federation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHIMOIO, Mozambique (PANA) - Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi on Friday inaugurated a new Coca-Cola bottling factory in the central Mozambican city of Chimoio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The factory is a joint venture between Coca-Cola, South African Bottling Company (SABCO) and the Mozambican government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mocumbi said that such a major investment in Chimoio was part of the government's plan &quot;'to achieve the balanced development of the country&quot;'.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The policy would help reduce the existing regional imbalances, whereby the bulk of industry is concentrated in the Maputo area in the far South, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin Alfredo of the Coca-Cola subsidiary, told hundreds of people at the inauguration that the new factory cost about 15 million U.S.  dollars. It was built in 15 months on land that was previously virgin bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The factory employs 160 people, and has the capacity to produce three million cases of soft drinks a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The project not only involves considerable capital investment, but also aims to increase the availability of soft drinks on the national market, simultaneously creating more employment and contributing to an increase in the gross national product and to the government's national budget,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Africa group president of the Coca-Cola company, Carl Ware, announced that Coca-Cola will invest another 45 million dollars over the next four years to double its business in Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe Mozambique is a great place to do business for any well- run, well-supported venture, and we believe the unique nature of our business will contribute significantly at every level of the Mozambican economy,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;'Our commitment to our Southern African bottling partners has never been stronger and this joint venture is just the latest reflection of our growing support,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coca-Cola-Sabco already operate a successful bottling plant in Maputo, which has made Coca-Cola company drinks (coca-cola fanta and sprite) widely available in Mozambique, utterly destroying the once thriving trade in soft drinks smuggled in from South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chimoio plant will supply the central provinces. A new bottling plant is planned in Nampula for the north of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 430 people are now directly employed by Coca-Cola Sabco in Mozambique. But the company estimates that for every one of them, ten other jobs are created, mainly in the retail trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ware also presented a Coca-Cola Foundation grant of 250,000 dollars to former first lady Graca Machel, president of the Mozambican Community Development Foundation (FDC), a grassroots NGO catering to the needs of women and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grant is intended to &quot;improve the quality of life for Mozambique's children&quot;, Ware said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A release said Coca-Cola has donated over 30 million dollars in support of community development in Africa since 1990.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (PANA) - The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) is looking for ways of cooperating with Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) on the continent, the Secretary-General, Salim Ahmed Salim, said on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a press conference in Dar es Salaam, Salim, said NGOs had greatly contributed in the development process of the continent hence the need for cooperation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no reason why we should not cooperate with them,&quot; he said, adding that there has been some suspicion between governments and the organisations, as each side points an accusing finger at the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said NGOs have done a good job to make sure that governments properly performed their duties of developing their people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are looking for ways to help the Non-Governmental Organisations and we plan to sit with them for consultation,&quot; Salim added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He, however, urged nationals to take active part in running the organisations rather than depending on foreigners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tanzanian Government recently criticised organisations it termed &quot;brief-case NGOs&quot; saying it will not tolerate those of them set up to funnel public funds to private ends. This drew a sharp reaction from NGOs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the debts of some member countries to the OAU, Salim said the situation had now improved, with only five countries accounting for the large part of those debts. &quot;Payment of debts is now encouraging,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim was this week elected OAU Secretary-General for an unprecedented third four-year term.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Movement of the Islamic Society MSI (which had to drop its original name, Hamas) placed a distant second with 69 seats, while the erstwhile single party, the National Liberation Front (FLN), won 64 seats.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Al-Nahda Movement won 34 seats, the Front of Socialist Forces (FFS) and the Rally for Culture and Democracy (RCD) won 19 seats each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Workers' Party secured 4 seats while independent candidates won 11 seats in together. Three smaller parties shared the remaining five seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several parties, including MSI and Al-Nahdah, challenged the results as soon as they were officially announced. Cheikh Mahfoudh Nahnah, the MSI leader, alleged vote rigging and manipulation of voters by state agents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the head of a United Nations team which monitored the polls, K.L.  Singh, expressed satisfaction with the organisation of the elections.  He said the event was a great victory for Algeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the chairman of the victorious RND, Abdelkader Bensalah, said the election results were &quot;a first step towards setting up legitimate state institutions and a collective victory for Algerian people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the people's massive vote for the RND was a show of support to the democratise reforms initiated by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is yet to be ascertained whether this would end the bloody war being waged by the banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) since 1992 when the Algiers government cancelled polls which the FIS was poised to win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimated 60,000 people, most of them ordinary people, have been killed in the mayhem.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRIPOLI, Libya (PANA) - Libyan leader, Col. Moammar Kadhafi on Friday in Triopli, received a large delegation of French businessmen and industrialists currently visiting the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kadhafi said at the meeting attended by French ambassador Josette Dallant that the tense relations between his country and the West had made it &quot;very difficult&quot; to develop economic cooperation between the two parties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the dispute between Tripoli and Paris over the explosion of a UTA flight in 1998 in the Tenere desert in Niger, does not prevent the French oil giants, Total and Elf Aquitaine, from continuing oil exploration and production in Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paris had accused Kadhafi's government of masterminding the blast in which many people died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States also accused Libyan agents of bombing a PanAm aircraft the previous year over the town of Lockerbie in Scotland, killing more than 250 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libya is currently under a United Nations air embargo initiated by the two western powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington wants two Libyans it says were involved in the Lockerbie affair to be tried in the United States but Tripoli refused to hand over the men saying such a trial should take place in a neutral country or at the international court at the Hague in Netherlands.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources in the Prime Minister's Office told the Tanzania News Agency, (Shihata) Friday, that the food will start to be distributed in two weeks' time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sources said that the food, made up of 9,100 tonnes of maize and 450 tonnes of beans worth TShs.1.55 billion (USD 2.58 million), will be distributed free of charge to the needy, especially the elderly and people in poor health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The able-bodied people will have to get the food through Food For Work Programme,&quot; the sources said, explaining that the types of job include brick laying and other public works in the villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sources said that apart from food, WFP has also given TShs.0.713 billion (USD 1.189 million) to cover distribution expenses. The programme has also made available direct and indirect support totalling TShs.211,556,600 (USD 285,961).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Not even a celebrated training tour of Germany, one of the world beaters in soccer, could save Kenya from a 3-0 drubbing in the hands of Olympic champions Nigeria, in one of the African qualification matches played Saturday for the World Cup in 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group one match lived up to the media hype with substitute Wilson Oruma, who over-celebrated his 83th minute goal that effectively put the game beyond the Kenyans, receiving a yellow card from Mauritian referee Lim Kee Chong for pulling off his shirt after scoring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oruma was lucky to get away with that warning for a repeat of a conduct that earned his teammate Austin Eguavoen the marching orders when Nigeria met Guinea April 5 in Lagos.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps Oruma knew his team had nothing to lose having dominated the Kenyans in every department of Saturday's game in Lagos watched by a capacity crowd at the National Stadium in Surulere, a Lagos suburb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday Oliseh drew first blood, firing a blistering shot in the 12th minute that caught the Harambee Stars goalkeeper off guard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The worst was yet to come for the Kenyans, who flew in from Germany late Friday and failed to have the essential work out to have a feel of the host's playing pitch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emmanuel Amunike made it 2-0 in the 44th minute for the Nigerians, ending the first half with that scoreline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since only one team goes through from each of Africa's five groups, the group one spot belong to the Nigerians who top this cluster, which also includes Burkina Faso with 13 points from five matches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria's last match against Guinea in Conakry August will be a formality since none of the three other teams in the group can catch up.  Kenya is placed second with seven points with Guinea and Burkina Faso trailing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday's was one of the best games by Nigeria's Super Eagles, now coached by Frenchman Phillipe Troussier, whose new 10,000-U.S.-dollar a month contract is ironically under strain for two previous narrow wins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Oruma was ungentlemanly for pulling off his shirt during the game, Amunike made up for that lapse by presenting referee Lee with his own jersey to rap up an evening of superlative performance by the Eagles, who gave Nigerians something to cheer about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian players, all professionals, were apparently buoyed by the presence in the VIP box of Nwankwo Kanu, captain of the under-23 squad that gave Nigeria the Olympic soccer gold in August 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kanu was recently certified fit to resume his fledgling career after undergoing an operation to correct a defective heart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A delighted Kanu, who arrived just in time for Saturday's match was the toast of soccer fans who hugged and kissed a player that is tipped to star for Nigeria in France '98.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria's victory Saturday gives berth for a second consecutive World Cup appearance after the Eagles put up an impressive show at U.S.A. '94.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have noted that voting took place calmly and quietly,&quot; he told reporters Saturday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The O.A.U. sent 70 observers to Algeria from its secretariat, member states, and nongovernmental organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Above all, he said, the presence of the observers was &quot;a gesture of active solidarity&quot; with Algerians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have wanted, by our presence, to share its (Algeria's) pains,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turnout at the polls reached 65.4 percent and victory went to the National Democratic Rally. It won 155 out of the 380 seat National Assembly. The Movement for an Islamic Society (formally the militant Muslim group, Hamas) followed with 69 seats. AL-Nahda movement won 34 seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Liberation Front, Algeria's former sole party, will now send 64 representatives to the assembly. The Social Forces Front and the Rally for Culture and Democracy will each have 19 seats and the Workers' Party four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remaining seats will be shared among independents who have won 11 and three small parties sharing five seats.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (PANA) - The Organization of African Unity, the continent's preeminent political body, has made significant progress in the past 10 years and it is something to be proud of, Secretary- General Salim Ahmed Salim said Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporting this Sunday, the Tanzania news agency, Shihata, quoted Salim as saying: &quot;Success is a relative term but we have been able to offset many dangerous situations in Africa which might have erupted into civil wars.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes, rather than heading off wars, the organizations has only been able to delay conflicts long enough to allow for a chance of negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the O.A.U. had been active in trying to end conflicts in the Comoros, in both the Congo Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Burundi. He was addressing a press conference organized by the Tanzania Journalists Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim has visited all but two of the 53 O.A.U. member states. He said that 90 percent of these travels were related to conflict solving. He dispelled the notion that he was more on tour of Africa than staying in his office in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do not enjoy those travels as now air travels are more of a risk,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often, he said, he has been unable to send his top aides to represent him because often ranking state officials would not meet with his representatives. In a recent case, Salim said he was invited to the Democratic Republic of Congo. He sent his deputy who never met with anyone higher than a minister.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The countdown to whether Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe will win in their battle to have the elephant downlisted begins in earnest Monday when the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) gets underway in Harare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African elephant is, again, expected to take centre stage during the 11-day meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there are 115 agenda items, 89 tags for species and 75 proposals, the elephants, as was the case in the last three bi-annual meetings, are set to dominate this year's event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Cites Secretary-General Izgrev Topkov is aware of this, hence his call last week for journalists to see &quot;beyond elephants.&quot; At a recent news conference he said: &quot;The Zimbabwean media should not only report on elephants. Besides the elephants there are many other animals which might steal the limelight.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although at least 600 plant and animal species -- including the elephant, cheetah, leopard, whales, black and white rhino -- are facing extinction and so are listed on appendix 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe have launched spirited campaigns in proposing that the elephant be downlisted to appendix 2, where it could be traded under an export permit without endangering extinction of the species.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appendix 2 includes species that are not yet endangered but are being monitored to ensure sustainable utilisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Species listed under this category may be traded commercially where an export permit is issued and provided trade would not be detrimental to the species in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe, for instance, contends that its elephant population of some 60,000 will not be threatened with extinction if traded commercially.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, the elephant is posing a threat to human life and an ecological disaster because Zimbabwe's carrying capacity for this mammal is 35,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the ivory ban was imposed, Zimbabwe has at least 40 tonnes of ivory stockpiles. These prizes, worth 40 million zimdollars (nearly four million U.S. dollars) are gathering dust at national parks and wildlife premises, thereby losing value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While countries lobbying for the donwlisting of the elephant say they have a strong case, they are facing stiff opposition from the United States and numerous Western-backed animal rights groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. has said it will oppose downlisting elephants and allow African countries with elephants to dispose of their ivory stocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leader of the U.S. delegation to the meeting, Donald Barry, said Cites was critically important in safeguarding the world's wildlife and that his country would oppose the downlisting proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While many other African countries would like to have their elephants downlisted, these countries do not want to speak openly on the issue.  They fear upsetting the all too powerful Western countries as this could lead to their losing aid and other forms of bilateral assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts say the elephant issue is no longer about protecting the animals but is very much political as it is economical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So complex is the issue that Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe are now calling for a secret ballot to choose whether the elephants should be downlisted or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All this is to protect delegates from intimidation by Western countries opposed to the lifting of the ivory trade ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will get full support if voting is done by secret ballot,&quot; a delegate said Friday at the two-day pre-conference meeting. &quot;It has emerged that some countries, and even ngos, fear the economic repercussions if they do not vote the way of those who provide aid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concern has been raised that the U.S. would oppose the move to vote by secret ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe could take comfort in the fact they are fully and openly supported by some groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Conservation Union in Zimbabwe will support the country's proposal to downlist the elephant to allow limited international ivory trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency's announcement has been regarded as a major boost to the three countries' lobby but whether it would have an impact or not is another matter altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union's pro-downlisting stance is based on a report prepared after the review of elephant management in the three concerned African states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report concluded that no major risks to the Zimbabwean elephant population had been identified and current levels of offtake appeared to be sustainable. &quot;The downlisting of the elephant was a necessary step towards ensuring that local communities living adjacent to wildlife resources fully benefited from such resources and thereby give them an incentive to contribute towards wildlife conservation,&quot; said the union's national committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Japan is doubtless hoping that any motion to downlist elephants will be upheld. It has expressed interest in buying up to 180,000 tonnes of ivory from the three Aouthern African countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PART II - DETAILS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 A joint FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission visited DPR Korea from 17 to 24 May. Its finding have been summarized in a Special Alert issued on 3 June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 The Mission concluded that the food crisis is worsening, with a grave food security situation developing in all parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 The Government's records showed that the food stocks of the Public Distribution System (PDS) on which some 80 percent of the population rely for their basic requirements, were expected to run out by the end of June. The food situation was equally desperate for the five million collective farm workers and their families who are not covered by the PDS but receive their share of the crops at the time of harvest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 Commercial imports are mainly limited to barter arrangements because of the country's serious hard currency constraints, and are inadequate to ensure regular food supplies, even at severely reduced levels, to the majority of the population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.5 In assessing the prospects for the main harvest in October, the Mission found that early winter thaw in March and good rains in May had benefitted the germination and establishment of maize and also supplemented soil moisture and irrigation supplies for paddy. Maize planting had been completed by mid May and paddy transplanting was expected to be completed by early June, some two weeks in advance of normal sowing periods. However, in spite of a mass Government programme to replenish top soils last winter and increase the supply of organic fertilizers, food production this year will continue to be seriously constrained by the lack of essential inputs such as chemical fertilizers, pesticides and fuel and spare parts for machinery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.6 The Mission concluded that the total import requirements for the 1996/97 marketing year (November 1996 to October 1997) amounted to some 1.9 million tons. Out of this, 430,000 tons might be imported commercially with confirmed food aid contributions providing an additional 323,000 tons. The remaining uncovered requirement would thus be close to 1.2 million tons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.7 Recorded arrivals during the month of May total some 69,000 tons. This can be compared to 40,100 tons of food which arrived during the six-month period November 1996-April 1997.  Confirmed shipments for June amount to 192,000 tons, including a bilateral contribution of 70,000 tons of maize from China.  Total arrivals in June are expected to increase even further: the European Community, which in May sent a shipment of 35,400 tons of rice and maize meal, is currently discussing with WFP the possibilities of further large-scale contributions to DPR Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. REGIONAL OPERATION FOR THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO, RWANDA, BURUNDI AND TANZANIA (WITH INFORMATION FROM THE REPUBLIC OF CONGO)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO - information as of 5 June</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 The Mbandaka repatriation is nearing its end. By 5 June, 6, 904 refugees had been repatriated to Rwanda and only a few hundred people are now left in the area. As the number of Rwandans flown home from Kisangani is 39,394, this brings the total number of refugees evacuated by air to Rwanda from these two locations to 46,298.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 Approximately 2,500 refugees remain at the Kisangani transit centre awaiting evacuation to Rwanda. All the 659 refugees at Obilo, km 82, will be transported to Kisangani with the next train. Unconfirmed reports indicate that around 2,000 refugees have just arrived by boat in Ubundu, further south. A UN mission is planned for 6 June to visit the area to confirm the presence of the refugees and make the necessary preparations for their repatriation. Other UN missions are flying to Ikela and Boende with the same purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 The WFP airlift of food into Kisangani continues, to build up stocks for the rehabilitation programme in DR Congo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 Various security incidents were reported in Uvira, now that preparations are under way for the return of thousands of refugees from Tanzania and the return of displaced Congolese (Zaireans), who left the area in October 1996, from Kalemie.  The escarpment road between Bukavu and Uvira is facing increasing security problems and a UNHCR vehicle was attacked by armed men along this route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.5 The security situation in the Goma area is also steadily deteriorating and the number of violent incidents targeting aid agencies is on the rise. UNHCR has temporarily suspended its operations in Karuba, a major collection point for refugees who wish to return to Rwanda, following the killing of a local Save the Children worker and four accompanying refugees. Staff of World Vision, recently established in Goma, were also attacked by armed men on 4 June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. REPUBLIC OF CONGO (Congo/Brazzaville)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.1 The air repatriation from Brazzaville is planned to commence on 6 June. There are now some 5,000 Rwandan refugees at Bilolo, the accommodation centre 20 km north of this city.  Eight barges provided by the Government left Brazzaville to fetch another 8,000 refugees in Liranga and Lukolela, but due to heavy fighting in Brazzaville and in the north of the country, the barge convoy returned to Brazzaville on 4 June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.2 A round trip by barge takes a minimum of seven to ten days but as the airstrips in the area are too small to receive large aircraft, all the refugees are to be moved to Brazzaville before being flown to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. BURUNDI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.1 Insecurity increases near the capital with sustained heavy fighting clearly audible in Bujumbura.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.2 WFP assessment teams are evaluating the needs of displaced and regroupement sites in Bubanza and Kayanza provinces, amid reports that the food security situation of some groups is rapidly deteriorating. Once this assessment exercise is completed, WFP will start targeted distributions to needy groups, while waiting for similar exercises to cover the whole of the provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.1 WFP, Kagera authorities and the regional Hospital Administration have signed an agreement covering WFP's assistance to in-patients in five hospitals in areas of Kagera region which have hosted refugee populations. Under this programme, WFP will provide food commodities to these hospitals, thus reducing expenses to patients and increasing their access to a basic diet while they are in hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.2 The influx of Burundian refugees into Kasulu and Kibondo districts continued during the week. Some 6,500 refugees were registered in Kasulu, most of whom had transferred from the holding centre in Kigoma town. Nduta and Mkugwa camps in Kibondo district received 261 new arrivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.3 Barge operations out of Kigoma port have resumed. The first barge from Uvira arrived in Kigoma, was loaded, and departed on 4 June to Uvira. Lake operations to Bujumbura are also due to begin soon, once food commodities allocated to Burundi arrive in Kigoma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.4 Drought operation: WFP has begun the local procurement of 5,000 metric tons of maize and 480 metric tons of pulses in Tanzania. These commodities are expected to be delivered starting next week, for distribution to drought-affected persons. NGOs will effect distribution to those families identified as no longer having any purchasing power. Special attention will be given to vulnerable persons, children and the elderly. WFP teams will monitor the distribution and ensure those targeted are reached. The impact of the food distributions will also be assessed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. SUDAN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 WFP/Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) have still not received June clearance for flights into the south, resulting in suspension of all relief flights from Lokichokio, Kenya, since 3 June. In addition, a continued ban on WFP C-130 flights, in place since 30 March (with the exception of one air drop which took place on 30 May), has had serious consequences on displaced and war-affected persons throughout the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 The situation is especially critical in Bahr el Ghazal, Upper Nile and Jonglei, where significant food shortages and cases of severe malnutrition have been reported by OLS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 Over the past two months, an average of 20 percent of the total planned beneficiaries in the South have received food assistance, with only 9 percent of planned air deliveries taking place in southern Sudan. WFP delivery into the south with Buffalo aircraft was 450 metric tons. The flights of the Buffalo aircraft were also suspended between 6-16 May and since 3 June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 The breakdown of the total limited food distribution (830 metric tons) which was possible during the period 1-31 May, to a total of 212,230 war-affected and displaced persons, is as follows: Bahr el Ghazal: 150 metric tons to 50,250 beneficiaries; Jonglei/Upper Nile: 73 metric tons to 61,675 beneficiaries; and Equatoria: 607 metric tons to 100,300 beneficiaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.5 WFP Kampala reports that the first tranche of 350 metric tons of cereals dispatched by WFP from Uganda has now arrived in southern Sudan for distribution to Sudanese returnees and displaced persons. Between June and August another 1,828 metric tons of mixed commodities will be sent by WFP Kampala to Yei County and 167 metric tons to Western Equatoria. This operation, initiated in late April, involved the use of 10 long-haul private trucks for the route Kampala/Koboko, near the border with Sudan, and a dozen short-haul trucks for the rest of the route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D. ANGOLA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 WFP will begin an emergency food airlift to assist displaced persons in Lunda Norte. Internally displaced began arriving in N'Zaji village on 19 May, reportedly fleeing fighting between government troops and rebels in surrounding areas. By 1 June, 2,100 persons had arrived and reports speak of 200 new arrivals per day since then. Most of the displaced people, who are being accommodated in a makeshift camp, are in good condition. Some children, however, show signs of malnutrition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 Emergency food assistance for 3,000 persons and supplementary food rations for 100 malnourished children will be airlifted. A team from WFP Luanda and the WFP Saurimo sub- office in Lunda Sul province has been dispatched to the area to supervise and monitor food distribution. Meanwhile, WFP implementing partner in N'Zaji, the Lutheran World Federation, is distributing food from stocks of a WFP-assisted project to the displaced persons until airlifted commodities arrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E. SIERRA LEONE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE - information as of 5 June</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 Fighting in Freetown which followed the coup of 25 May has subsided significantly over recent days. However, there are on-going reports of the harassment of civilians by street gangs, and an increase in armed robbery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 Civilians from Freetown have been reportedly fleeing in large numbers to the interior regions and small influxes of refugees have been reported in Guinea. The situation remains stable in Liberia, where no new refugees have been reported.  WFP staff is on stand-by in border areas to monitor the situation. Contingency plans are in place in preparation for any sudden mass influxes from Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 WFP Sierra Leone international staff, all of whom were evacuated last week, are being redeployed to WFP operations in Guinea and Liberia until such time as their return to Sierra Leone is possible. WFP national staff in Freetown are reported safe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 Approximately 2,500 refugees remain at the Kisangani transit centre awaiting evacuation to Rwanda. All the 659 refugees at Obilo, km 82, will be transported to Kisangani with the next train. Unconfirmed reports indicate that around 2,000 refugees have just arrived by boat in Ubundu, further south. A UN mission is planned for 6 June to visit the area to confirm the presence of the refugees and make the necessary preparations for their repatriation. Other UN missions are flying to Ikela and Boende with the same purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 The WFP airlift of food into Kisangani continues, to build up stocks for the rehabilitation programme in DR Congo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 Various security incidents were reported in Uvira, now that preparations are under way for the return of thousands of refugees from Tanzania and the return of displaced Congolese (Zaireans), who left the area in October 1996, from Kalemie.  The escarpment road between Bukavu and Uvira is facing increasing security problems and a UNHCR vehicle was attacked by armed men along this route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.5 The security situation in the Goma area is also steadily deteriorating and the number of violent incidents targeting aid agencies is on the rise. UNHCR has temporarily suspended its operations in Karuba, a major collection point for refugees who wish to return to Rwanda, following the killing of a local Save the Children worker and four accompanying refugees. Staff of World Vision, recently established in Goma, were also attacked by armed men on 4 June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. REPUBLIC OF CONGO (Congo/Brazzaville)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.1 The air repatriation from Brazzaville is planned to commence on 6 June. There are now some 5,000 Rwandan refugees at Bilolo, the accommodation centre 20 km north of this city.  Eight barges provided by the Government left Brazzaville to fetch another 8,000 refugees in Liranga and Lukolela, but due to heavy fighting in Brazzaville and in the north of the country, the barge convoy returned to Brazzaville on 4 June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.2 A round trip by barge takes a minimum of seven to ten days but as the airstrips in the area are too small to receive large aircraft, all the refugees are to be moved to Brazzaville before being flown to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. BURUNDI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.1 Insecurity increases near the capital with sustained heavy fighting clearly audible in Bujumbura.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.2 WFP assessment teams are evaluating the needs of displaced and regroupement sites in Bubanza and Kayanza provinces, amid reports that the food security situation of some groups is rapidly deteriorating. Once this assessment exercise is completed, WFP will start targeted distributions to needy groups, while waiting for similar exercises to cover the whole of the provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.1 WFP, Kagera authorities and the regional Hospital Administration have signed an agreement covering WFP's assistance to in-patients in five hospitals in areas of Kagera region which have hosted refugee populations. Under this programme, WFP will provide food commodities to these hospitals, thus reducing expenses to patients and increasing their access to a basic diet while they are in hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.2 The influx of Burundian refugees into Kasulu and Kibondo districts continued during the week. Some 6,500 refugees were registered in Kasulu, most of whom had transferred from the holding centre in Kigoma town. Nduta and Mkugwa camps in Kibondo district received 261 new arrivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.3 Barge operations out of Kigoma port have resumed. The first barge from Uvira arrived in Kigoma, was loaded, and departed on 4 June to Uvira. Lake operations to Bujumbura are also due to begin soon, once food commodities allocated to Burundi arrive in Kigoma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.4 Drought operation: WFP has begun the local procurement of 5,000 metric tons of maize and 480 metric tons of pulses in Tanzania. These commodities are expected to be delivered starting next week, for distribution to drought-affected persons. NGOs will effect distribution to those families identified as no longer having any purchasing power. Special attention will be given to vulnerable persons, children and the elderly. WFP teams will monitor the distribution and ensure those targeted are reached. The impact of the food distributions will also be assessed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. SUDAN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 WFP/Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) have still not received June clearance for flights into the south, resulting in suspension of all relief flights from Lokichokio, Kenya, since 3 June. In addition, a continued ban on WFP C-130 flights, in place since 30 March (with the exception of one air drop which took place on 30 May), has had serious consequences on displaced and war-affected persons throughout the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 The situation is especially critical in Bahr el Ghazal, Upper Nile and Jonglei, where significant food shortages and cases of severe malnutrition have been reported by OLS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 Over the past two months, an average of 20 percent of the total planned beneficiaries in the South have received food assistance, with only 9 percent of planned air deliveries taking place in southern Sudan. WFP delivery into the south with Buffalo aircraft was 450 metric tons. The flights of the Buffalo aircraft were also suspended between 6-16 May and since 3 June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 The breakdown of the total limited food distribution (830 metric tons) which was possible during the period 1-31 May, to a total of 212,230 war-affected and displaced persons, is as follows: Bahr el Ghazal: 150 metric tons to 50,250 beneficiaries; Jonglei/Upper Nile: 73 metric tons to 61,675 beneficiaries; and Equatoria: 607 metric tons to 100,300 beneficiaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.5 WFP Kampala reports that the first tranche of 350 metric tons of cereals dispatched by WFP from Uganda has now arrived in southern Sudan for distribution to Sudanese returnees and displaced persons. Between June and August another 1,828 metric tons of mixed commodities will be sent by WFP Kampala to Yei County and 167 metric tons to Western Equatoria. This operation, initiated in late April, involved the use of 10 long-haul private trucks for the route Kampala/Koboko, near the border with Sudan, and a dozen short-haul trucks for the rest of the route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D. ANGOLA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 WFP will begin an emergency food airlift to assist displaced persons in Lunda Norte. Internally displaced began arriving in N'Zaji village on 19 May, reportedly fleeing fighting between government troops and rebels in surrounding areas. By 1 June, 2,100 persons had arrived and reports speak of 200 new arrivals per day since then. Most of the displaced people, who are being accommodated in a makeshift camp, are in good condition. Some children, however, show signs of malnutrition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 Emergency food assistance for 3,000 persons and supplementary food rations for 100 malnourished children will be airlifted. A team from WFP Luanda and the WFP Saurimo sub- office in Lunda Sul province has been dispatched to the area to supervise and monitor food distribution. Meanwhile, WFP implementing partner in N'Zaji, the Lutheran World Federation, is distributing food from stocks of a WFP-assisted project to the displaced persons until airlifted commodities arrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E. SIERRA LEONE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE - information as of 5 June</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 Fighting in Freetown which followed the coup of 25 May has subsided significantly over recent days. However, there are on-going reports of the harassment of civilians by street gangs, and an increase in armed robbery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 Civilians from Freetown have been reportedly fleeing in large numbers to the interior regions and small influxes of refugees have been reported in Guinea. The situation remains stable in Liberia, where no new refugees have been reported.  WFP staff is on stand-by in border areas to monitor the situation. Contingency plans are in place in preparation for any sudden mass influxes from Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 WFP Sierra Leone international staff, all of whom were evacuated last week, are being redeployed to WFP operations in Guinea and Liberia until such time as their return to Sierra Leone is possible. WFP national staff in Freetown are reported safe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigerians were Sunday still celebrating their country's second World Cup qualification after the Super Eagles' trounced Kenya's Harambee Stars 3-0 on their way to France '98.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos, the nation's economic hub, has been agog with jubilation which started soon after Mauritian referee Kim Lee Chong blew the final whistle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many soccer fans, drumming and dancing took to the streets and rounded off the merriment in beer palors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The match was broadcast live by the Nigerian Television Authority with each of the Eagles three goals greeted by resounding ovation at the Lagos National Stadium and across the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although it is not the first time Nigeria, the Olympic champions, has qualified for the World Cup finals, the build-up to Saturday's match was not without hitches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Problems arose over the choice of camp site for the Eagles and the tactics of their new technical adviser the Frenchman, Phillipe Troussier, which Nigerian fans considered suspect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Nigerians pre-occupied themselves with the needless debates rather than preparation, Kenya took its squad on a three-week playing tour of Germany under their German coach, Reinhardt Fabisch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it turned out, the critics were proved wrong. The match was no more than a practice session for the Eagles array of stars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fabisch admitted that much in his post-match interviews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My boys did play well but they lost to the Nigerians who are superiors,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Eagles' impressive performance in Nigeria's first World Cup appearance in U.S.A.'94 was, he added, &quot;the beginning of good things to happen to Nigerian and African soccer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fabisch said: &quot;The Super Eagles will go far in France '98. They will go beyond the quarter-finals and may even qualify for finals with their present skills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An over-joyed Nigerian sports minister, Jim Nwobodo, described the Eagles performance as &quot;simply wonderful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told reporters: &quot;We showed that we are not only the Olympic champions but the current best African team.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Nigerian Vice President Augustus Aikhomu, an avid soccer fan, said he was happy with the win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wish our team good luck,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eagles pointman Daniel Amokachi, nicknamed &quot;the Bull&quot;, said his squad hoped to do better in France than at U.S.A. '94.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm sure there is going to be a difference this time,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria lost to Italy in the second round of the 1994 tournament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently reacting to the warning from soccer buffs against over- celebration, the chairman of the Nigerian Football Association (NFA), Abdulmumini Aminu, said with the France '98 ticket assured, his association would concentrate on preparation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the association had already received invitations from Brazil, Germany, Japan, Korea and South Africa ahead of the World Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot accept all these invitations but we will endeavour to take on those that can help us in our preparation,&quot; Aminu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The association will also organize friendly matches at home &quot;so that (the press) can participate in evaluating their (Eagles) performance and pointing out where we have gone wrong,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian's French coach, Troussier, who is architect of Saturday's victory is anything but happy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My future now depends on the N.F.A. and the people of Nigeria. I am not expecting any favour from anybody as I believe my job will speak for me,&quot; he said at post-match news conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a reference to strong speculation that his new 10,000-U.S.- dollar a month contract was on the line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These was reinforced by the unexplained presence in Lagos Saturday of the Eagles' former coach, Clemens Westerhof, of the Netherlands. He abandoned Nigeria after leading the Eagles to a high point of the nation's soccer in U.S.A. '94.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Westerhof insists he is jobless and on vacation but would not mind being called back to handle the Eagles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some fans see the VIP treatment Westerhof received at the stadium during the Nigeria-Kenya match as perhaps being a veiled warning to Troussier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria still has an outstanding match against Guinea in August in the qualification series. But its outcome will be a formality, since the Eagles have already secured the sole ticket in the four-nation group one Africa zone, which includes Burkina Faso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, soccer-crazy Zambians in the capital, Lusaka, were in a subdued mood Monday, following their 3-0 defeat Sunday in Johannesburg by South Africa's Bafana Bafana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This loss ended the Zambia's hopes for a first World Cup soccer final.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is unbelievable. I could not believe it when the referee blew the final whistle It is just too much,&quot; said Joshua Zulu who had watched the game on television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His sentiments were echoed by several other disappointed fans who spoke to PANA in Lusaka, Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have not eaten anything since Sunday. All the appetite has gone.  It is like a funeral for me and other members of the family,&quot; George Tembo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambian team played two international friendly preparatory games against Cameroon and Kuwait before its encounter with South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia failed to qualify for the U.S.A '94 World Cup soccer finals following a controversial 1-0 loss to Morocco in a crucial qualifying match played in Casablanca.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The conference of the parties to the the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) began Monday with Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe challenging the international community to accept that a well monitored, evaluated and ecosystem-managed habitat could support sustainable utilization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe told the 10th Cites meeting that there should be encouragement of sustainable utilization and development for those countries whose actions upheld scientifically accepted standards, while penalizing which abused the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To refuse to accept the principle of differentiated responsibilities will mean doom for the international environmental movement and certainly disaster to natural resources covered by Cites Convention,&quot; Mugabe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 5,000 delegates are attending the meeting, the second to be held in Africa after the 1983 meeting hosted by Botswana.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opening of this meeting in the Zimbabwe capital, Harare, was spiced with a traditional African flavour of song and dance by a troupe clad in warrior garb of animal skins and wielding knobkerries (short sticks with a tennis ball size knobs at one end) and shields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This meeting has a participation of 96.3 percent, the highest in the 25-year history of the convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe, who last week assumed the chairmanship of the 53-member Organization of African Unity, spoke for the entire continent. He said that some of the world's plant and animal species were threatened with extinction due to absolute poverty within the populations of developing nations which has led to over-reliance on natural resources for survival, especially in rural areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other causes, he said, were the loss of habitat because of deforestation and human and animal pressure. He added that developing countries, where natural resources were a significant contributor to the gross domestic product, had to service their debt</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told delegates of the situation in Zimbabwe where a commitment to natural resource conservation was demonstrated by the fact that 15 percent of the country was classified reserved forests and national parks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If areas under the Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (Campfire) were included, he said, 30 percent of Zimbabwe's mass was under wildlife management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is legislation in Zimbabwe to ensure the sustainable use and conservation of Zimbabwe's biological heritage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe told the meeting that Zimbabwe's management of the environment and natural resources was fashioned to meet the development interests of the present generation without jeopardizing those of posterity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our people, through their representative and democratically elected councils, are now able to participate in wildlife management,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They now understand the value which they derive from better environmental management principles since they associate wildlife and other natural resources with their own socio-economic development,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The principle of anticipating and preventing negative environmental impacts, he said, was less costly and more effective than correcting such problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To safeguard the future generations' right to resources, we believe in environmental impact assessments,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told delegates that Zimbabwe protected its natural resources, especially wildlife, at great expense. The army, police, national parks scouts and rangers are mobilized to guard against poachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Water also has to be pumped from underground sources for the animals as they tend to be found in arid and semi-desert conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He drew laughter from delegates when he said that Zimbabwe believed that every species should pay its way to survival and with the management strategies that had been devised, most species would survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saying they have too many elephants, Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe have been lobbying delegates to the current Cites conference to have elephants downgraded from Apendix I of endangered species to Appendix II. The later permits trade under a permit without endangering the species with possible extinction</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The countdown to whether Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe will win their battle to have the elephant downlisted from the list of animals at risk of extinction began Monday when the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) gets underway in Harare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African elephant is, again, expected to take centre stage during the 11-day meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there are 115 agenda items, 89 tags for species and 75 proposals, the elephants, as was the case in the last three bi-annual meetings, are set to dominate this year's event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Cites Secretary-General Izgrev Topkov is aware of this, hence his call last week for journalists to see &quot;beyond elephants.&quot; At a recent news conference he said: &quot;The Zimbabwean media should not only report on elephants. Besides the elephants there are many other animals which might steal the limelight.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although at least 600 plant and animal species -- including the elephant, cheetah, leopard, whales, black and white rhino -- are facing extinction and so are listed on appendix 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe have launched spirited campaigns in proposing that the elephant be downlisted to appendix 2, where it could be traded under an export permit without endangering extinction of the species.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appendix 2 includes species that are not yet endangered but are being monitored to ensure sustainable utilisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Species listed under this category may be traded commercially where an export permit is issued and provided trade would not be detrimental to the species in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe, for instance, contends that its elephant population of some 60,000 will not be threatened with extinction if traded commercially.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, the elephant is posing a threat to human life and an ecological disaster because Zimbabwe's carrying capacity for this mammal is 35,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the ivory ban was imposed, Zimbabwe has at least 40 tons of ivory stockpiles. These prizes, worth nearly four million U.S. dollars are gathering dust at national parks and wildlife premises, thereby losing value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While countries lobbying for the donwlisting of the elephant say they have a strong case, they are facing stiff opposition from the United States and numerous Western-backed animal rights groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. has said it will oppose downlisting elephants and allow African countries with elephants to dispose of their ivory stocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leader of the U.S. delegation to the meeting, Donald Barry, said Cites was critically important in safeguarding the world's wildlife and that his country would oppose the downlisting proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While many other African countries would like to have their elephants downlisted, these countries do not want to speak openly on the issue.  They fear upsetting the all too powerful Western countries as this could lead to their losing aid and other forms of bilateral assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts say the elephant issue is no longer about protecting the animals but is very much political as it is economical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So complex is the issue that Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe are now calling for a secret ballot to choose whether the elephants should be downlisted or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All this is to protect delegates from intimidation by Western countries opposed to the lifting of the ivory trade ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will get full support if voting is done by secret ballot,&quot; a delegate said Friday at the two-day pre-conference meeting. &quot;It has emerged that some countries, and even ngos, fear the economic repercussions if they do not vote the way of those who provide aid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concern has been raised that the U.S. would oppose the move to vote by secret ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe could take comfort in the fact they are fully and openly supported by some groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Conservation Union in Zimbabwe will support the country's proposal to downlist the elephant to allow limited international ivory trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency's announcement has been regarded as a major boost to the three countries' lobby but whether it would have an impact or not is another matter altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union's pro-downlisting stance is based on a report prepared after the review of elephant management in the three concerned African states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report concluded that no major risks to the Zimbabwean elephant population had been identified and current levels of offtake appeared to be sustainable. &quot;The downlisting of the elephant was a necessary step towards ensuring that local communities living adjacent to wildlife resources fully benefited from such resources and thereby give them an incentive to contribute towards wildlife conservation,&quot; said the union's national committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Japan is doubtless hoping that any motion to downlist elephants will be upheld. It has expressed interest in buying up to 180,000 tonnes of ivory from the three Southern African countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Transcript of questions and answers on the visit by UN Ambassador Bill Richardson to Congo, from the daily briefing at the State Department by Department spokesman Nicholas Burns, June 9.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I also want to let you know I just had a phone conversation with our Assistant Secretary of State John Shattuck, who's in Kigali. He accompanied Ambassador Bill Richardson to Lubumbashi and to Kisangani over the weekend for their talks with Mr.  Laurent Kabila. John left the Richardson party when Richardson came back to the United States. John visited Kisangani on his own; he went to Goma, and he's now in Kigali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We believe that it will now be possible for the United Nations advance team that will investigate the allegations of mass murder in and near Kisangani - for that team to arrive in Congo on June 20; and for the full investigation to begin on July 7. John Shattuck interviewed personally Rwandan Hutu refugees who were caught up in the atrocities a couple of months back.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has heard first-hand reports of killings by forces in the area of refugees most disturbing. As you know, when Ambassador Richardson met with Mr. Kabila over the weekend, Ambassador Richardson was able to elicit from Mr. Kabila a promise that the government of the Congo will cooperate with the United Nations in investigating these very serious allegations of mass atrocities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We hope that Mr. Kabila will now turn these promises into action on the ground. It is one thing to make a promise. It is quite another thing to actually come through and make sure that every member of the government of Congo, including soldiers from the rebel alliance who may have been in and around Kisangani several months back when that town was besieged, that they be made available to the UN investigating team so that the people who committed these murders will be brought to justice. That's a very important commitment that he has made. What will be more important is to see that commitment turned into action by the Congo Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly, I do want to correct a story in the papers over the weekend. This issue has to deal with American economic assistance to Congo. Secretary Albright has not made a decision on whether or not the United States will be extending assistance to Congo and what that amount will be. I'm not blaming the journalists and the newspapers here. I think there may have been some incorrect backgrounding out of some of the officials who were in Congo over the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I want to be very clear about this because I have talked to the Secretary about this. The United States will base our decision on whether we extend economic assistance to Congo on the actions of the government in Kinshasa. The actions will be very clear. It has to do with whether or not the government is going forward towards political and economic reform, or whether it's not; whether the government is going to cooperate on issues like investigating mass atrocities.  These are important. For the life of me, I don't know how this $50 million figure got into the press. Again, I am not blaming the journalists. I am not blaming the newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think there is some incorrect and ill advised backgrounding, and it ought to stop, because the Secretary of State makes these decisions. This is a very important decision, and she has not yet made this particular decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Could you bring us up to date on the situation in Brazzaville, across the river from oasis of peace and democracy, Kinshasa?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Well, I think you know that since June 5th, the situation in Brazzaville has been chaotic and violent. There has been continuing fighting between the Congolese military forces and the paramilitary forces loyal to the former president, Denis Sassou Nguesso. The situation remains quite confused as we speak. I just spoke to the head of our task force, up on the seventh floor, on Congo-Brazzaville. I can tell you that our American embassy continues to be operating, but under quite adverse circumstances. The embassy took an RPG hit over the weekend, also some small arms fire. We don't believe that this fire was directed at the embassy; we think it was just sporadic fire and it was coincidental. We have 28 American diplomats in Congo-Brazzaville. We'd like to bring that number down to 15 American diplomats in the next day or two if we can. The problem is, we've not been able to evacuate those Americans. It's simply unsafe to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are safe, and if we can get them out through the services of the French Government - you know the French have put in several hundred troops into Brazzaville today - or any other charter aircraft, we will do so. We will only do so under safe conditions. In addition to that, we believe there are approximately 200 private American citizens in Congo-Brazzaville, 75 of whom are probably in the capital city. The embassy is in contact with as many of those people as we can be through our radio network. We are advising Americans, any Americans listening to this through the Voice of America or BBC, to keep their heads down, to stay where they are, not to go out into the streets because it's quite dangerous in the streets of Brazzaville right now. We'll be in touch with them as the best way to get them out of Brazzaville as soon as we can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, I will say that we're very grateful for the quick action of the French Government to try to protect international interests in Brazzaville. We're working very closely with the French Government.  Politically, we believe in very strong terms that the government and the rebel forces ought to agree to an immediate cease-fire, and then to a restoration of the constitution, as it was in power before the fighting broke out. Presidential elections are scheduled for July 27th. We believe that if there can be a cease-fire and talks between the government and the rebel movement, it may still be possible to implement the presidential elections on the 27th of July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only other thing I'd say, George, is that yesterday we issued a travel warning, advising American citizens to defer travel to Congo-Brazzaville. It is our very strong wish that American citizens not travel there. It is simply too dangerous. They're literally taking their life into their hands if they choose to do that. Still on this situation, Bill?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Yes, Nick, yes, indeed. Two questions. One, does the U.S. have any capability with the Kearsarge in that - has the Kearsarge left that area?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: The Kearsarge has left. It's no longer off the coast of West Africa. It's heading towards the Mediterranean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: And I take it the U.S. has no intentions of getting involved in the Brazzaville evacuation. That would be a French operation, strictly?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: We're going to have to take this on a day-to-day basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Okay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Obviously, what is first and foremost in our minds is the security of our American citizens -- private Americans, as well as our embassy staff. If they can be brought out by the French or by chartered aircraft, that is the best solution. But we will take this one step at a time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Secretary Tom Pickering was involved in this crisis all throughout the weekend. Secretary Albright was briefed over the weekend. She was briefed on a couple of occasions today. So we are giving this high-level attention. It's a very serious situation for the Americans and the other foreigners who are trapped in Brazzaville today. Crystal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Is the United States - there were reports - I believe it was in the Post today that Mobutu soldiers, ex-soldiers, have found a home with the ex-president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: With Mobutu?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: No, no, not with --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: The ex-president?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: I'm sorry the ex-president of Congo --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: Oh, Brazzaville --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Congo, Congo, not --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: You mean, Mr. Sassou Nguesso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Yes, there you go. And - I didn't know how to pronounce his name, and I wasn't going to try. So you did it for me. But there seems to be a rift going - a siding going on there, is the United States worried about this siding? And is the United States worried that there are going to be other eruptions in Africa? It seems as though we are in the midst of a lot of flash points --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: It's a terribly unstable time in Central Africa, and, indeed, in West Africa, with the situation in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I can't say that we are aware exactly who all these rebel fighters are and whether not some of them may have been buttressed by former members of President Mobutu's presidential guard or military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All I can say is that the United States is very concerned and disappointed that these rebel fighters chose to take up arms. There is a government in Congo-Brazzaville. The way to resolve problems is not to fight and kill people and produce mass chaos in this capital city and throughout the country, rather it is to sit down and talk through problems. That is the rational way to proceed with problem solving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we are very disappointed that this situation has come to pass.  But our first concern has got to be the safety of our own citizens, always. After that, of course, we will want to exert whatever influence Ambassador Aubrey Hooks can, our very fine ambassador in Brazzaville, to see that a cease-fire is put into place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now let me just tell you, since I always think it is important to say when foreign service officers do good things, one of our consular officers, Ava Rogers went out over the weekend, taking great danger upon herself, to try to find American citizens who we thought were in a particular neighborhood in Brazzaville. She and a Marine guard went out. They were unable to get to the Americans, but our deputy chief of mission then went out and was able to get to a certain group of Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These American foreign service officers are putting their own lives on the line and trying to help American citizens. That is their obligation and duty, obviously to defend American citizens, not to take their life in their hands, but to do what they can to help American citizens, and I wanted to draw attention to Ava Rogers, who I think acted heroically over the weekend to find American citizens caught up in the fighting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Statement on Algeria issued by State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns, June 9, followed by questions and answers at the Department's daily briefing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: The United States commends the government of Algeria for holding parliamentary elections and for inviting international observers to monitor them. We'd like to praise the Algerian people for their courage in turning out in such high numbers at the polls last week. The Algerian people are the best judge of how the election results will contribute to the process of national reconciliation in Algeria. A multiparty assembly holds the potential to move this process a step forward.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We do urge the government of Algeria to address the issues raised by international observers and political parties, as Algeria prepares for municipal and local elections. The election campaign also marked a commendable increase in the openness of Algerian television and radio. We hope that increased openness will continue, as Algeria moves toward peace, stability and democracy that so many Algerians have desired for such a long period of time. I'll be glad to take questions on that issue, on the issue of international observation, once we get to questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Yes. On Algeria, I'm unclear about your statement.  You're considering the elections are reasonably free and fair, or what's your assessment about the report of the observers?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I would not use the words free and fair to describe the Algerian elections, simply because the international monitors, in whom we have great trust, did not use those words. Clearly, there were some problems with the Algerian election in the way it was carried out. We do think it's positive, however, that people voted in great numbers; and it's positive that the government was able to open up television and radio to political debate and political discourse.  So our statement is an attempt, really to congratulate the people of Algeria, first and foremost; and secondly, to ask the government to continue with this small step forward in openness, because we think that might be a way to provide some positive momentum in relations between the government and others. Lord knows, Algeria needs that after all the terrorism and the violence and the killings of the past several years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Statement by Sheila Camerer MP, chief spokesperson on Justice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Party has no problem in principle if the TRC decides to hold the hearings of a TRC Committee in camera in KwaZulu-Natal.  In fact, when the TRC Bill was debated in the Justice Portfolio Committee 2 years ago we repeatedly warned that if hearings were held in public, particularly in KZN, it would give impetus to the bloody revenge killings that are endemic in that province.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">When this was put to Dr Boraine who gave evidence to the Committee at the time, he agreed that it was a problem but could not offer a solution. Now the TRC has suggested a solution and we must be thankful for small mercies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. The National Party has consistently warned that in many cases public hearings would tend to tarnish the reputation of innocent people, inflame emotions, provoke vengeance and do little for national reconciliation. This is true for KZN but also for other regions of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We suggest the TRC should apply this principle to its hearings in all regions where desirable, preferably to all such hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The composition of such a TRC committee concerned must be balanced - though this is difficult to achieve with the present commissioners - and subject to scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - The human rights situation in Tunisia remains a source of concern, despite the recent release of some prisoners of conscience.  The circle of repression continues to widen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Victims of arbitrary detention, torture or ill-treatment and imprisonment after unfair trials are not only political opponents: Human rights defenders and activists, trade unionists, and wives and relatives of political prisoners and refugees are increasingly targeted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public liberties, already much restricted in the last few years, have been further curtailed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human rights defenders and activists find it increasingly difficult to carry out their activities. In the past few years human rights defenders have been arrested, imprisoned, tortured, intimidated and harassed for their work on behalf of the most vulnerable victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If pressure and harassment are not enough to intimidate human rights defenders, the Tunisian authorities use other methods, such as imprisonment and torture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often they also confiscate their passports, disconnect their telephone and intercept their mail so as to cut them off from the outside world,&quot; Amnesty International said today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a 19-page report published today Amnesty International shows the gap which exists between the discourse of the Tunisian authorities, who continue to reiterate their commitment to respecting human rights, and a reality where the most fundamental rights are violated daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An increasing number of people, including many women and even children, are subjected to retaliation because of their family links with political opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wives of Islamist political prisoners and refugees are the first victims of this repression. Their freedom of conscience and of movement are restricted, their physical and mental integrity and their right to privacy are often violated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often prevented from working, from leaving the country or from moving freely within the country, these women are kept under strict surveillance. They are routinely arrested and interrogated about the activities of their exiled husbands, about their contacts with them, and about their sources of subsistence: They are often subjected to torture, including sexual abuse; some have been forced to divorce and others have been imprisoned for long periods, and their children have been traumatized by police raids conducted both during the day and at night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, anyone who gives them any help, however minimal, risks being prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of people have been accused of &quot;unauthorized collection of funds&quot; and imprisoned just for having helped families of political prisoners and refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is difficult to reconcile such practices with the Tunisian authorities's discourse in favour of women's rights,&quot; Amnesty International said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samira Ben Salah, mother of four young girls and married to an exiled Islamist opponent, came under pressure after her husband fled the country in 1991. She was frequently arrested and in 1992 she was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. After her release from prison, arrests and interrogations continued; in detention she was undressed, tortured, sexually abused, threatened with rape and forced to file a divorce procedure. Her ordeal lasted until the end of 1996, when, after strong international pressure, she was able to leave Tunisia with her daughters to join her husband in Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the case of Samira Ben Salah and of some other women have been finally resolved and they have been able to obtain passports for themselves and their children, dozens of other women continue to suffer similar injustice. After years of ordeal and with no prospect of any solution in the near future, some women have chosen to take the risk of leaving the country with their children without travel documents. Some are now in a difficult situation in neighbouring countries and others have been arrested before they could cross the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rachida Ben Salem was arrested on 18 May with her two small daughters as she was attempting to cross into Libya, from where she was hoping to be able to go to join her husband, a political refugee in Holland. She is now detained on charges of belonging to a criminal gang and risks a long prison sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International and other human rights organizations have continued to raise their concerns with the Tunisian authorities.  However, detainees continue to be held in secret detention and tortured in the Ministry of the Interior itself. The scale and persistency of the violations, and the lack of action on the part of the authorities, show that such violations are tolerated or even encouraged at the highest level of the Tunisian Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Complaints lodged by victims of such violations are usually ignored or, worse still, can result in further violations as a means of punishment,&quot; Amnesty International said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While welcoming the release of six prisoners of conscience in the past few months, and the recent release on bail of the trade unionists who were detained since last April, Amnesty International renews its call on the Tunisian authorities to take without delay concrete measures to put an end to the daily human rights violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization calls in particular for the release of all men and women prisoners of conscience, an end to the practice of torture, the setting up of independent and impartial investigations, and an end to intimidation and harassment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - A high-level Amnesty International delegation led by Secretary General Pierre Sane today met with members of the Kenyan government led by Vice President George Saitoti and urged the government to live up to commitments to improve the country's human rights record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation from the world-wide human rights organization raised concerns with various representatives of the government including torture, deaths in suspicious circumstances, the use of the excessive force by the police and prison conditions. These concerns were included in a memorandum sent to the government last month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We appreciate the opportunity to enter into dialogue with the government about our human rights concerns in Kenya,&quot; Mr Sane said.  &quot;During the meeting the Vice President made public commitments to address our concerns and we will be closely monitoring how these commitments are implemented.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We look forward to continuing dialogue with the government and hope that the government's commitments to respect international standards on human rights will be translated into action to improve the fundamental rights of all Kenyans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the meeting, the Vice President committed the government to investigating all cases of torture and to bringing those found responsible to justice. He assured the delegation that police brutality and the unlawful use of force is not tolerated and in the case of unlawful killings, police officers will be prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Sane rejected arguments about national sovereignty put forward by the Vice President saying that &quot;both the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations have recognized that human rights do not fall solely within the domain of national sovereignty. The Kenyan people are entitled to the same basic rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as any other citizen of the world. By ratifying international standards such as the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights the Kenyan government has acknowledged that it is the responsibility of the international community to scrutinize, monitor and demand that the government lives up to its obligations&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those present at the meeting also included the Attorney General, the Solicitor General, the Commissioner of Prisons, the Commissioner of Police, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Education and Secretary General of KANU, the Director of the CID and the Permanent Secretaries of the President and Ministry of Health. The Amnesty International delegation is due to have follow-up meetings with the Attorney General and Commissioner of Prisons to concentrate on specific areas such as legal reform and the human rights record of the Kenyan Police.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - There could be quite a few &quot;casualties&quot; in the Cape Peninsula's booming guest house sector over the next few years, a study by the Cape Technikon tourism research unit has found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The research project established that the majority of the guest houses in the Peninsula have been in existence for no longer than three years and have not yet experienced a full economic cycle of between five and seven years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the guest houses have not yet experienced a full downturn in the tourism sector and it is expected that some of them would not survive it, the study has found.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another problem identified for the industry was that 60 percent of all earnings came from foreigners, which meant that spiralling crime, the &quot;What happens if Mandela dies?&quot; factor and a downturn in the economy could cause the clientele to dry up overnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In such a situation only well-organised and established houses will survive,&quot; the researchers reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Private guest houses were identified as the biggest part of the formal accommodation sector, accounting for 36,2 percent of all the formal accommodation establishments in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although a guest house requires a relatively high capital outlay, it is relatively easy to start one, as there are virtually no legalities involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study found that more than 70 percent of all guest houses are either sole proprietors or partnerships and only 23 percent have opted for legal protection as companies or close corporations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">English was the most common business language used by guest house owners, followed by German.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of people employed in the industry was estimated at 958, with an additional 252 finding part-time work in the sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are about 3 300 beds available in guest houses in the Peninsula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the period of the study - one week in October last year - the average occupancy rate was 51 percent. A profile of 59 guest house owners found the majority to be &quot;no fools&quot;, with 52,8 percent boasting a post-matriculation qualification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only 32 percent of the guest houses surveyed belonged to the Guest House Association of South Africa, and about 55 percent were members of Captour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Word of mouth was the most popular promotional method used to advertise guest houses, followed by advertisements in magazines, according to the study.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - If Beryl Eichenberger, promotions manager of Independent Newspapers Cape and recent winner of the 1997 Rotary Press Award, had not carved a successful career for herself in promotions/public relations, she could have made it big on the stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who says? Not Beryl herself, but people who have watched her in action at major events like the Cape Argus/Pick 'n Pay Cycle Tour, The Cape Times/Southern Life Big Walk and many others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diminutive but extrovert Beryl certainly has the dynamism, energy and chutzpah to have made it big in front of the footlights before a critical audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she herself is pretty dismissive of her early stage career.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I was a little girl growing up in Sussex in England, the elder sister of twins, I had so much excess energy that my father simply had to find extra things for me to do,&quot; she recalls. &quot;He also didn't want me to be saddled with a Sussex accent for the rest of my life. So one of the things he did was to send me to elocution lessons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was the only Jewish girl in the class and I chose Shylock from The Merchant of Venice. I'm not very big now, but I was widgy then.  Looking back, it must have been a real hoot for the audience to see this tiny little thing up on stage, rubbing her hands with glee, and intoning 'Many a time and oft on the Rialto...'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Later, when I was working in London, I joined an amateur dramatic society and was selected to play the part of Rosa Gonsalez, a whore, in Tennessee Williams' play Summer and Smoke. I threw myself whole- heartedly into the part to the extent that, on opening night, I walked off with one of the essential props and nearly ruined the play for the leading man and leading lady. Anyway, they were all very nice about it and said I had played the part really well!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By this time, however, Beryl was serious about a business career.  She came to South Africa 28 years ago &quot;more or less to find myself&quot;.  She loved the country immediately and made it her home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a retailer by trade - I suppose you could say a creative retailer,&quot; she said. &quot;I studied dress design in the UK, but when I arrived and joined Truworths I went into the display field. I then went to Greatermans, where I was fortunate to work for a boss who saw my potential for special events. For five years I did a lot of special fashion events and shows, liaising with television and contracting people like David Hall Green and Doreanne Berry to compere them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I learned a lot working with them and watching them, to the extent that I was later able to compere some myself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had a high-profile job in Johannesburg when my then friend, now my husband, was transferred to Cape Town and he asked me to join him.  There was no equivalent in Cape Town of the job I had in Johannesburg and I joined Woolworths. I worked there for 12 years and got brilliant training, first as a buyer - selector as they called it - and then in their PR division, where I worked closely with the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Six years ago, when the job of promotions manager became vacant at the Cape Argus, I applied for it and got it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What are the most stimulating events she and her department are involved in?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, obviously the cycle tour, first and foremost, though I've never sat on a bicycle. It's far too painful. The whole job revolves around working with Rotary as part of a team. Each person is a cog in the wheel and when that wheel starts turning it doesn't stop until the tour is over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a huge event - 27 000 riders from 32 000 entries this year.  We had to disappoint 5 000 because the roads wouldn't take them. The Cape Times Big Walk has 15 000 entries annually and going up.  Together, these two events raise R1 million for the Rotary coffers every year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And there are many other community-based events: the Gun Run, the LifeCycle Expo, the Food and Drink Festival, the Waterfront Wine Festival and so on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They call her Beryl &quot;Just in Case&quot; Eichenberger or Beryl &quot;We'll Make a Plan&quot; Eichenberger, because years of experience have taught her to leave nothing to chance. Her most palpitating emergency?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There have been many. One I remember was when a huge canvas hall, not a marquee, that had been erected at the Waterfront for the Miss Rave competition finals blew down. The October south-easter got hold of it and by the time it had finished the tent, or what was left of it, looked as if a giant foot had trodden on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There we were with just two days to go before the event and 1 500 tickets sold. We had just 48 hours to find a suitable venue, with stage, changing rooms, accommodation for the audience, etc.  Eventually we found a vacant warehouse at A Berth and in 24 hours, working around the clock, we transformed it into a glittering show venue. As a venue it was such a surprising success that for two or three years afterwards it was still being used for exhibitions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comprehensive citation for Beryl's Rotary Press Award includes this line: &quot;Not only does Mrs Eichenberger assist with the overall organisation of the events mentioned (The Argus cycle tour, Big Walk and others), she goes beyond the call of duty in exhibiting friendship and help to Rotary. She is a true and loyal friend.&quot; But Beryl will not accept the kudos alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a team effort,&quot; she said of the Independent Newspapers (Cape) promotions department. &quot;There are eight of us and we depend very much, one upon the other. We call ourselves the A-Team because we make your promotions come together - and we deliver.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - French champagne producers will investigate reports that Paarl wine co-operative KWV tried to sell thousands of cases of sparkling wine disguised as champagne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KWV has denied press reports last week that a plan was approved by senior executives in 1990 to pass off sparkling wine as champagne in the United States and Europe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reports said the wine was to be sold in special bottles imported by KWV from France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andre Enders, head of the Comite Interprofessionnel des Vins de Champagne, the French champagne producers' body, said his association viewed the allegations in a serious light. &quot;We will undertake our own investigation,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interviewed by telephone from his offices at Epernay in Champagne, Mr Enders said the association would contact St Gobain, the French glass manufacturer from whom KWV allegedly imported more than 250 000 champagne bottles, as well as the suppliers of corks to KWV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But of course anyone can buy these bottles and use them, provided the contents are labelled correctly. There is also no ban on using the same corks as we use for champagne. But if the corks were labelled with the word 'champagne', that is not acceptable&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Enders said the goal of his association's investigation was to tighten protection for champagne producers and the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If this has happened once it can happen again. The public pays the price for champagne and has a right to the authentic product.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He hit out at the American authorities who allegedly refused to allow the fake champagne to enter the United States but did not take the matter further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is as if they only wanted to protect their own public,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The most striking aspect of the unfolding SABC TV drama is the anarchic &quot;each man for himself&quot; ethos which has apparently gripped the news department for more than two years and climaxed in the latest exodus of senior executives from the corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the sake of simplicity, some observers have placed the staff into three vaguely political camps - each trying to muscle out the others - but informed sources say the reality is less conspiratorial and more an insidious battle by individuals to survive in a fog of uncertainty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The catalyst for the latest shake-out was the controversial entrance of the irascible Allister Sparks, whose appointment as editor of news and current affairs was the last straw for editor-in- chief Joe Thloloe, who resigned in outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SABC chief executive Zwelakhe Sisulu has remained tightlipped about his actions, although it is well known that he and Thloloe have had numerous clashes over management style and restructuring.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one observer puts it: &quot;Thloloe came from a different kind of newspaper tradition, and associated himself strongly with the Black Editors Forum. Sisulu has long since dissociated himself from the BEF and has become a highly ambitious corporate animal who sits on a number of boards. Their styles contrasted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was the apparently secretive way in which Mr Sisulu went about his negotiations with Mr Sparks - who has to all intents and purposes replaced Mr Thloloe - that prompted Mr Thloloe to quit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wrote that he had left &quot;because the Sparks arrangements were made behind my back and I had to hear them in the corridors of the SABC&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has since emerged that Mr Sisulu offered Mr Thloloe a newly created administrative position, that of head of department, which Mr Thloloe refused and which, according to one insider, is now a post with a big question mark over it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Sparks' appointment, on the other hand, has met with some opposition from outside the corporation - although Mr Sparks himself has emphasised that the welcome inside has been positive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Sisulu has been castigated by the Inkatha Freedom Party for surrendering editorial integrity in what is perceived as a political sop to the African National Congress, while some independent observers have questioned the &quot;irony&quot; of hiring a white print journalist without a strong track record in the television industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's strongly held in some quarters that Mr Sparks, who has been wanting to work hands-on at the SABC for a long time, according to a former board member, is a pivotal player in the rise to power of a coterie of people from the Institute for the Advancement of Journalism (of which he is executive director) - people with a longstanding history of struggle journalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Sisulu's association with Mr Sparks is a close one, dating back to the Rand Daily Mail. He is hoping Mr Sparks' intervention in restructuring TV news and providing on-the-job training for reporters will deliver the long-overdue improvements to the service and, some say, ease the pressure Mr Sisulu has been under from the Government to effect a more visible transition in the news content.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He may not have anticipated, however, the effect of his decision on Mr Thloloe's senior appointees, including head of news Ivan Fynn and head of current affairs Sarah Crowe, who both tendered their resignations last week in solidarity with Mr Thloloe's sentiments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, given that Mr Thloloe's senior, TV chief executive Jill Chisholm, had only shortly before announced that her contract would not be renewed, it's not surprising that Mr Thloloe's staff felt under siege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critical observers say Mr Thloloe was languishing with a poor team of executives and journalists and that, while he was highly regarded as a newsman, he did not have the necessary training skills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, credence has been given to speculation that the new breed of TV journalists, including political editor Phil Molefe, his deputy Ivor Powell and presenters Max du Preez and Jacques Pauw, are pushing for the removal of the &quot;old guard&quot; with the leak of a memo by Mr Molefe. It says a clique with an NP agenda has been sabotaging the work of reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;old guard&quot; is seen to be represented by long-serving staff members headed by executive producer Jeremy Thorpe, fired recently for criticising the decision to scrap the SA Press Association service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The irony is this: despite months of treachery and intrigue at the top, the reporters have been churning out the news - all but oblivious to the &quot;crisis&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the reporters remarked: &quot;The poisoned brew tastes the same, no matter what hand is stirring it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's another way of reflecting on what has become increasingly evident at the SABC - that there has been a distinct lack of good leadership in a task which is perhaps unrealistically ambitious.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The Bid Company is to set up a meeting with People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad) to make clear its withdrawal from the controversial gangs-for-peace initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The severing of the Olympic connection with the gangs initiative was spelt out in a letter to Pagad last week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, at a weekend rally attended by about 300 people, Pagad repeated its demand that Chris Ball and other members of the Bid Company executive be removed, and he warned that if this was not met Pagad would have no choice but to boycott businesses which had sponsored the bid, including Pick 'n Pay, Caltex, Mercedes Benz and Telkom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday's rally was called to protest against the now-defunct alliance between the Cape Town Community Olympic Forum and the Community Outreach Forum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Olympic connection with the initiative was ended last week when the Olympic Forum - which operates independently from the Bid Company - withdrew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intiative is now be monitored and co-ordinated by other community organisations as part of a broad anti-crime campaign. It will be known as the Peace Intiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pagad said it was not against the Olympics as such but against any Olympic Games of which drug dealers and gangsters could be part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pagad national co-ordinator Abdus-Salaam Ebrahim said the breaking up of the alliance was a &quot;victory for Pagad and for all who assisted&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Of all the old apartheid structures which had to be transformed with the advent of full democracy in South Africa, none presented a more pressing or difficult challenge than the SABC. From having been the public voice and propaganda arm of a shameful and repressive order, the complex State-owned electronic media monopoly had to be changed into a politically independent organisation capable of meeting the demands of a profoundly different social, economic and political system.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the transformation is far from complete, it has been embarked upon with vigour and commitment and in many important areas impressive progress has been made. Unavoidably, though, problems have arisen. Among them is an alarming operational deficit, accompanied by disturbing allegations of mismanagement, profligate spending and theft, and the unexpected departure of some of the most influential and respected news and administrative staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the number of people who depend entirely on radio or television for their daily information about the diverse and rapidly changing society they live in, the crisis at the SABC is cause for grave concern. The corporation is an essential element in the process of nation building; it is the key player in fostering not only a new sense of national identity but a spirit of reconciliation and national unity. It also has a vital role to play in education and in many other fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To serve the unique needs of the emerging new South Africa, the SABC will have to resolve its problems urgently and effectively - and, above all, it must be seen to be doing so. The corporation's setbacks cannot be allowed to overwhelm it, or divert it from the commendable course it embarked upon a few short years ago.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Police were questioning four people today in connection with the hijacking and murder of a Simon's Town doctor and his fianc e, whose bodies were found in Mitchell's Plain yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men were arrested early today by a Mitchell's Plain police patrol, who found two pistols in their possession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police are investigating the possibility that Dr Tatilal &quot;Rolly&quot; Kessow, 56, and his fianc e, Henrietha Millward, 54, were kidnapped after visiting a casino in Lansdowne late on Saturday, before being shot dead in their car and dumped near a rubbish heap.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their night of terror on the Cape Flats the hijackers abducted Dr Kessow and Mrs Millward and shot both in the head, then used Dr Kessow's BMW to hold up and rob two petrol attendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cold-blooded shooting of a motorist beside his broken-down car in Lansdowne is also being investigated by detectives, who were piecing together the gang's movements yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trail of death came to light when police found the bodies of Dr Kessow and Mrs Millward on the corner of Mitchell Road and Highlands Road, Mitchell's Plain, about 3.25am yesterday. The couple went to Lansdowne after visiting family in Grassy Park, according to a relative, who could not say where exactly they had planned to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But police learned that Dr Kessow was a keen gambler, raising fears that he and his fianc e were stalked at the casino and attacked as they left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their bodies were found without valuables, jewellery or cash. Mrs Millward's pants had been undone but police did not believe she had been raped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 3.15am a gang using Mr Kessow's BMW pulled up in the forecourt of a service station in Morgenster Road, about 2km from where the bodies were found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There the gang, armed with a revolver, held up attendants and robbed them of a jacket, a radio-cassette player and cigarettes, all valued at about R400.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 4.50am the same gang attacked staff of a service station in Camberwell Road, Lansdowne, where they got away with R1 600 in takings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police were scanning the garage's closed-circuit security video recording to see if they could spot images of the gang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Lansdowne police were called to the scene of a murder in Orion Road, where a gang in a light-coloured BMW pulled up behind a man whose car had broken down at about 4.30am.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A witness told police that one of the gang opened fire and killed the motorist during an argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police are withholding the dead man's identity until his family has been notified of the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detectives were eventually called to Observatory, where a resident found Dr Kessow's car abandoned in Herschel Road about 8am.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The back seat was soaked with blood and the car's two right wheels were damaged as if it had hit a curb at high speed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forensic experts examining the car found a spent cartridge, packets of cigarettes, a drinking glass and a liquor bottle top. The forensic specialists combed the car for fingerprints.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MBABANE (Swaziland) - Swaziland will scrap the five year tax holiday it currently offers as an investment incentive to foreign investors when the kingdom's new Investment Bill is tabled in Parliament during the first week of July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bill, which has just been approved by Swaziland's Cabinet, was released for circulation amongst stakeholders on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bill, being piloted by the Ministry of Enterprise and Employment aims at charting a new strategy for luring direct foreign investment (FDI) into the country seeks to provide fresh incentives to attract investment particularly in the manufacturing sector.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New incentives include the scrapping of the five year tax holiday and replacing it with a system of investment credits, a targeted companies tax rate, a different tax rate for small companies and a low sectoral rate for manufacturing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In place of discriminatory incentives, the corporate tax rate, currently at 37.5% has been adjusted to 30%. The rate will be reduced by a further 5% to 25% within five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bill's broad-based objectives include promotion of local and foreign investment, protection of investment, settlement of investment disputes, establishment of an investment promotion centre and setting up a one stop service for investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While generally optimistic and supportive of the spirit behind the Bill, Swaziland industry is adopting a &quot;wait and see&quot; attitude until the its impact on the Kingdom's regional competitiveness is known.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are supportive of the concept but we have emphasised that investment should be a one-stop concept not a one-more-stop concept,&quot; Swaziland Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) Executive Director, Harvey Bird said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bird said the Chamber, while appreciating the financial and tax incentives, feels they should not be seen as more important than the country's regional competitiveness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many countries in the Southern Africa region have lower corporate tax rates than Swaziland,&quot; Bird said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chamber's involvement in Swaziland's investment promotion legislation dates back to a report by Irish consultant Patrick Padriac, whose recommendations are the base for the new Investment Promotion Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must demonstrate that we are facilitating new investment in the Kingdom,&quot; Bird said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federation Swaziland of Swaziland Employers (FSE) Deputy Executive Director, Muhawu Maziya said the new investment incentives should help the Kingdom survive regional competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The region is opening up to new competition,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions (SFTU) Assistant Secretary General Jabu Nxumalo said the manufacturing sector's investment incentives should include investors' easy access to operational land, an Export Processing Zone (EPZ) and effective trade liberalisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is government's responsibility to legislate investor friendly laws, settle disputes at the point of origin and invest in dialogue,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SFTU is opposed to the corporate tax cuts being carried over to the workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The taxes should be such that the small man does not end up paying for the big corporations,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federation sees the focus of new initiative being shifted to new investment, especially in the manufacturing sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We support any policy that is promulgated as long as it takes into account the social life, welfare of the people and investment,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MIDDLEBURG - Police reported on Sunday that yet another elderly couple died of carbon monoxide poisoning on Saturday after using a traditional coal brazer in their room to fight the bitter Highveld cold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police spokesman, Captain Doep du Plooy told African Eye News Service (South Africa) on Sunday that Christina Mabena (65) and her common law husband, Jacobus Jiyane (47) were found dead in their bed by their daughter at 14h30, after a worried neighbour sent a child to summon her from her in-laws.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The neighbour reportedly became concerned about the couple after they failed to answer their door despite his knocking. When there was still no answer at midday, he sent the child to fetch their daughter.  &quot;We understand that it gets really cold, but this is the second elderly couple in two weeks to be killed by home-made coal stoves.  The problem is that people seal all their windows and air vents to keep the cold out and then light these coal fires in what are basically drums,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The monoxide build up is so gradual that the victims slip into a coma and then death without even realising it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stove or brazers are know as imbawula and are believed to be the most popular form of indoor heating in poor rural areas.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Government has directed Aero Zambia and the Kenyan Airways to put in place arrangements that would ensure equitable sharing of business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acting Communications and Transport Minister Suresh Desai said yesterday until the arrangements were made, Kenya Airways flights would remain suspended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The two airlines have been asked to make arrangements for equitable sharing of passenger traffic. As long as these arrangements are not in place, the status remains the same,&quot; Mr Desai said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But sources, earlier said President Chiluba had ordered the Ministry of Communications and Transport to facilitate the resumption of Kenya Airways flights to Lusaka immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chiluba at the weekend said an airborne Kenya Airways flight from Lilongwe to Lusaka on May 12 was denied landing rights in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chiluba said this when he met representatives from the two airlines, the Ministry of Communications and Transport, and a delegation from Kenya on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He assured the Kenyans that the matter would be investigated and he would hold responsible whoever stopped the flight from proceeding to Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources said the officials from civil aviation maintained they were merely acting on instructions from the ministry to stop the aircraft from landing on Zambian soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to documents available to this paper, the Kenyan government requested on February 13 for a fourth frequency (Monday/Thursday) through the Zambian Ministry of Communications and Transport which was approved by Deputy Minister Gilbert Mululu on February 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bilateral air services agreement between Zambia and Kenya clearly allows either party to request for an additional frequency if need arises. Whoever ordered the aircraft to turn back was not in the meeting at State House that's for sure,&quot; the sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chiluba has ordered the ministry to lift the suspension on Kenya Airways so the airline resumes Monday/Thursday flights to Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kenyan delegation included its transport and communications minister Wilson Ayah, Kenya high commissioner to Zambia Joseph Sefu, deputy secretary (transport) Julius Okara, state attorney and delegation legal counsel Nathan Birundu and Kenya Airways managing director Brian Davies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambia delegation comprised Mr Desai, his deputy Mr Mululu, Aero Zambia chief executive David Tokoph, managing director Youndewossen Mengistu and many other civil aviation and transport officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya Airways has lost about $130,000 between May 12 to June 2 and risks losing over $1m if the Monday/Thursday summer flights do not resume.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The loss is $25,000 per round trip and that doesn't include revenue lost from connecting traffic out of Europe, Middle East on the inbound leg into Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The stoppage is a blow to the partnership we have with KA. It means we are in serious breach of agreement,&quot; the sources said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Central Board of Health (CBH) has finally been delinked from Government and all health workers will have to reapply for their jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health Minister Katele Kalumba who announced the move at the weekend said the decision would take effect on August 1 and only 69 employees would be retained at the ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Kalumba on Friday signed statutory instrument number 76 to herald the new measures.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All jobs will be advertised and contracts signed thereafter. The whole exercise should be completed by August 1. We are now implementing the National Health Services Act of 1995,&quot; Dr Kalumba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Government would now only deal with policy issues, the budget allocation for health, relations with donors, strategic management and advocacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of terminal benefits to employees before transferring them to Health Management Boards (HMB) had already been taken care of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Kalumba said Government would work closely with non- governmental organisations (NGOs), the donors and all interested groups to foster a higher delivery of health services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He observed that passion had been substituted with hostilities by some health workers even in mission hospitals. He urged health workers to treat their jobs as a calling and not as routine work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was need for valuable services to be offered to the sick in the new setting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As all jobs are up for grabs in the health boards, only the best people will be retained. We need to give quality health services based on mutual respect by both partners,&quot; he said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Kalumba also said Government had signed a memorandum of understanding with church-run medical institutions in the delivery of health services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The memorandum defines the rights, obligations and entitlements of both parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNICEF resident representative Mark Stirling in another development said his organisation would continue to assist Government to ensure all families, children in particular, received better medical services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNICEF would act as a bridge between Government and NGOs. It would facilitate dialogue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The curtain has drawn on Zambia's aspirations to play at the 1998 World Cup finals in France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday's loss to South Africa's Bafana Bafana signalled the end of Zambia's aspirations in the World Cup race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Zambia is out of contention for a World Cup finals place should not be treated as the end of the road.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, Zambia will not be among the creme de la creme of nations to line-up in France next year but this does not mean Zambia is dead and buried as one of the top teams on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia has yet to make her presence felt on the international scene since the Seoul Olympics, all because of a misguided approach which is crippling soccer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria learnt from Zambia how to win but Zambia has been failing to turn its abundant talent into goal-getters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday's 0-3 whacking from South Africa says it all about the calibre of the game in Zambia and not the players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whereas players with beautiful ball skills and natural acumen are readily available, the people who are charged with the responsibility of nurturing their talent are not there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) has lamentably failed to organise the national team let alone clubs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The endless list of successive FAZ executives have fallen far below expectations when it has come to driving the national team and clubs to higher heights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The preparations for the national team for international matches have always been half-baked yet Government's financial support is ready at all times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dream of Zambia playing at the World Cup will not be realised if Zambia continues pretending that all is well with the administration of soccer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government offered to fund the team's training before the South Africa match yet FAZ did not put forward any proposals for the simple reason that the executive is busy seeking a fresh mandate in the June 28 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia's failure to beat South Africa yesterday and consolidate the chance of playing at the World Cup finals is all the fault of the FAZ executive and not players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FAZ executive has let the nation down and has no moral right to seek a fresh mandate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fine, the officials don't play soccer but they have an obligation to prepare the team through effective training matches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A deliberate policy should be in place to ensure as many players from the league are exposed to international soccer, a trait which other countries have tapped but FAZ blocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As long as FAZ remains the domain of so-called long-serving administrators who are not achievers, Zambia will continue to sink as the continent's soccer force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia lost yesterday, but Zambia is far from finished so long we get the bearings right but not with people at the helm of FAZ who cannot scent victory.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa) is convinced the African Economic Community (AEC) will succeed because it has the backing of African regional economic groupings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comesa acting secretary general Erastus Mwencha said in an interview in Lusaka on Friday that it were the regional groupings building into a continental economic body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Comesa welcomes the introduction of the African Economic Community as it is in line with the principle of globalisation that is taking place around the world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot afford to continue thinking small in terms of our trade markets because we will lose out. We need a big market into which any of the countries on the continent will have easy access,&quot; Mr Mwencha said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Comesa signed a protocol that provided for the establishment of AEC at the recent Organisation of African Unity (OAU) summit in Harare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mwencha agreed with Comesa authority vice chairman and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni that the continental body should involve private businessmen to succeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe the organisation will be driven by businessmen involved in the regional groupings in various regions. Getting the private sector into the integration process is the essence of all these integration efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After all the private businessmen are the people who do business.  Without them, we cannot achieve market integration,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Museveni was quoted after the 33rd OAU heads of state summit last week in Harare as having said that the AEC was headed for failure unless the private sectors of individual countries were allowed to run the affairs of the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the African states have ratified the establishment of the AEC to create a common market for the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Mr Mwencha dispelled speculation that the Comesa secretariat had dismissed its directors of trade and customs Zewde Demissie and director of transport and communications Anastase Munyabarenzi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mwencha said the two directors were just normally retiring from the organisation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Government has continued to stall over the payment of over K10bn it owes food suppliers because of double-dealing by some members, Food Suppliers Association national chairman George Mwambazi has charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mwambazi said at the weekend that although suppliers were instructed to stop delivering food to Government institutions until all the debt was cleared, some of them had defied the directive.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the development had created suspicion in Government on whether suppliers were genuine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government had also taken advantage of the confusion and was making no effort to repay the huge debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We agreed that we should stop supplying food to Government institutions until the whole debti s cleared. But we have suppliers who are still supplying to Government institutions and are being paid cash. This is unfair to those who are owed money,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mwambazi said although the prisons department owed food suppliers more than K5bn, Government had only managed to pay K400m which was a drop in the ocean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warned suppliers that unless they observed the ban on supplying food to Government institutions, all those who are owed money would never get it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mwambazi said it was impossible for suppliers to sue Government and the only way to win the fight was to work together.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Peasant farmers in Chief Chitanda's area in Chibombo who were swindled out of millions of Kwacha by a maize buyer last year have appealed to Government to help them recover their money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The farmers said in Kabwe their efforts to trace the whereabouts of the trader, Mr Siyoto Mumbula of Siyohako Investments Limited have failed, hence the need for Government's intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of the farmers, Mr Gilbert Mpande of Kaponya village and Mr Petulo Haadunka from Fulabunga village said since last December when they reported the case to Kabwe police to date there were no signs that they would recover their money.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Narrating their ordeal, Mr Mpande said in October last year Mr Mumbula introduced himself to farmers in Chief Chitanda's area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said on October 18 last year the buyer collected 40 x 90kg bags of white maize from Mr Mpande and another 177 x 90kg from Mr Haadunka, promising to pay K15,000 per bag after 30 days from the date of collection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mpande explained that afer 30 days of waiting farmers started traveling to Kabwe to chase for their money and it was not until November 23 last year when Mr Mpande was given K150,000 as down payment . He said other farmers were not paid a single ngwee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mpande said after persistent knocks at his office at the former Zambia National Wholesale and Marketing Corporation (ZNWMC) the Mr Siyoto travelled to the area where he promised to pay the affected farmers in form of fertiliser, but he never returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A month later when they found the his office closed , farmers went to his home in Natuseko site and service where they only found his wife who told them her husband was still in Lusaka scouting for fertiliser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when the farmers went back on January 2 this year, they found the man had shifted his family to an unknown place and to date they have not traced him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mpande who said they have since then been calling at the police pointed out that their families were now starving while their animals have died from corridor and other diseases because they have no money to buy drugs. -Zana/ZIS.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It is all over. Zambia yesterday bowed out of the race, yet again, of the World Cup championship billed for France next year's when they suffered their worst defeat in 10 years at the hands of South Africa's Bafana Bafana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the dreams that the Zambian soccer fans had envisioned of donning national colours at the prestigious championship in France went up in smoke in a space of five minutes, no thanks to Helman Mkhalele and Phil Masinga first half goals.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right from the blow of the first whistle, Zambia went into the game too relaxed and casual for anyone's liking, what the porous defence and the once perfect pair of Harrison Chongo and Elijah Litana clearly failing to tick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was doomsday for anyone singing the famous Chipolopolo anthem as a swift Mkhalele ably cut his way through the midfield and slotted in the first Bafana Bafana goal in the 11th minute with a shot that left Zambia's goal minder Davies Phiri, sprawling on the ground, not knowing what had hit him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One for the hosts and nil for the visitors. The second goal was too much to handle as it came in just five minutes after the first through a Phil &quot;Chippa&quot; Masinga shot that was a creation from Mkhalele in the 16th minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mexico based skipper Kalusha Bwalya tried all he could to revive his passive side but alas, even the famous goal poacher Paul Chellah and once feared Dennis Lota failed to co-ordinate and make any sense of the first half.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On resumption, Zambia led by a fit Jonson Bwalya came into the game with a lot more vigour and inspiration than before, with a few good flashes from Mordon Malitoli who handled the right wing well but still, striking force was too blunt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John &quot;shoes&quot; Moshoeu and doctor Khumalo handled their midfield with precision and showed off their expertise and abundant talent than Hilary Makasa and Andrew Tembo trying to find their feet half the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The line, hook and sinker came through super substitute Mark Williams who came in for Shaun Barlett and scored the last goal of the day in the 75th minute after Khumalo collected a loose ball and passed it to Williams who made no mistake of finding the net.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We tried our best and I think it simply was not our day. We were rather shaky as we saw all the goals come on counter-attack,&quot; were stand-in national coach George Mungwa's words after the 90 minutes nightmare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;It took time to settle down also but I guess we now have to concentrate on the Africa Cup and hope we can win that cup.&quot; With the pressure obviously on Zambia, Lota found himself being handed a yellow card in 87th minute after he still went for a ball that South Africa's goal keeper Andre Arendse had already picked up leading to a near scuffle with Mark Fish in the thick of things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bafana Bafana coach Clive Barker commended the Zambian team for a good match and said: &quot;The 3-0 was not really a true reflection of the game as Zambia also had many chances though we seemed to have used ours ably.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - A crisis over salary increases has once again flared up at the Namibian Broadcasting Corporation (NBC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday a strike was averted by union leaders while more negotiations with management and the Board of Directors were opened up, according to an NBC Namibia Public Workers' Union (Napwu) Shop Steward Council member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unionist told The Namibian that an eight per cent increase across-the-board hike proposed by management had been rejected by NBC employees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national broadcaster has faced simmering discontent on the wage front for a number of years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yesterday the Napwu representative said that despite the fact that numerous surveys sanctioned by the station's board had revealed that NBC staffers were grossly underpaid, nothing tangible had yet emerge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff representatives were now considering taking tougher measures to ensure that staff grievances were addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said a recent survey had indicated that NBC employees, in all grades, were underpaid by about 33,31 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All we are requesting now is for our salaries to be adjusted to the job market level. We have collected signatures from the employees to show the Board that people are serious,&quot; he said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warned that this was the last time the union would try and reach a compromise with the Board as employees had been patient for the last six years and could no longer go on negotiating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the NBC was run as a parastatal, employees in other Government institutions, such as reporters, were paid far better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said if the trend continued, the NBC would end up with 'the dead wood' as its competent employees would continue to seek greener pastures elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the years the NBC has lost some of its most competent presenters, producers and reporters mostly to other Government institutions where they are offered better packages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NBC employees have also complained that with the implementation of the Wage and Salary Commission (Wascom) proposals they have been left worse off than before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the matter was laid before Prime Minister Hage Geingob when he met the NBC Board recently, he apparently said the NBC first needed to generate its own income before employees could clamour for pay hikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, disgruntled employees point out that this approach should then also be applied to the state-funded news agency, Nampa, and the state-funded newspaper, New Era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At present the NBC receives close to N$50 million from Government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - The Attorney-General has called for a thorough review of tender procedures and Tender Board practices, in the face of public criticism of government tendering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I recommend that a review be undertaken to ascertain whether the legislation and procedures regarding the awarding of tenders are adequately transparent and fair to ensure that tenders are awarded impartially,&quot; Vekuii Rukoro told an ethics and anti-corruption seminar at the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rukoro also questioned whether the current composition of the Tender Board was adequate and whether independent members should be added.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another aspect which needed investigation was whether adequate procedures existed to ensure that specifications were not written to favour certain companies &quot;and that the evaluations done by ministries are disinterested.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rukoro noted that the Tender Board must have adequate staff to evaluate tenders competently and independently of the ministry requesting the contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On contracts awarded by local authorities and parastatals, he said there was an absence of comprehensive laws regulating the awarding process which should be fair, impartial and open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on civil servants, who apparently lived beyond their means, Rukoro suggested that new anti-corruption legislation should make provision for investigating these individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Under the anti-corruption statutes of other countries, a public servant is guilty of corruption if he maintains a standard of living that is above his known sources of income.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For example, if a junior customs and excise official is known to have a fleet of expensive cars or to take expensive vacations abroad, questions may arise as to whether bribes or kick-backs were received by that official in the course of his duty,&quot; he pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rukoro said there should be a general criminal prohibition against the use of public office for private gain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on the same platform, opposition MP, Hans-Eric Staby noted that a culture of corruption thrived in secrecy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He accused the building industry of fostering selective transparency and secrecy which encouraged rumour and corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appealing for transparency in the sector, he said: &quot;Secret arrangements that might be quite innocent will be perceived as unethical simply because of their secrecy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staby also said negotiated contracts and exemptions from Tender Board Regulations triggered suspicions, especially when the state was involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seminar was officially opened by Prime Minister Hage Geingob who pledged to root-out corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African Minister of Water Affairs, Professor Kadar Asmal was guest speaker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government ministers, members of the diplomatic corps and representatives from the private sector attended the seminar.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hearing has been postponed for various reasons, prominent among them being the fact that a large number of the people to whom warning letters were addressed by the Commission, advising them that they would be implicated in a detrimental way by witnesses at the hearing, did not receive the notices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These notices (sent in terms of section 30 of the Act) were sent at the beginning of May, to these persons, many of whom are retired or former members of the South African Police and South African Defence Force, via nodal points or central communication points in the SA Police and Defence Force.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission has only now become aware of the fact that many of the people to whom warning notices were sent, did not receive the notices at all, and in other cases, only received the notices during the last week. Lawyers acting for the persons named in the notices, have indicated to the Commission that their clients require further time within which to consider the allegations against them, and to prepare for the hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, after studying documents which certain witnesses who are to appear at the hearing will refer to, it became clear to the Commission that such documents refer to persons to whom warning notices had not been sent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all the circumstances, the Commission has decided that in order to ensure that there can be no possible prejudice to the rights of any person who may be detrimentally implicated at the hearing, that it would be in the public interest to postpone the hearing for approx. 6 weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hearing will now take place towards the end of July, on a date to be announced by the Commission.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - The International Secretariat of OMCT requests your urgent intervention in the following situation in Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brief description of the situation :</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Secretariat has been informed by reliable sources of their grave concerns over the extra judicial or arbitrary execution of Ato Assefa Maru (37), human rights activist, member of both the Executive Committee of the Ethiopian Teachers Association (ETA) and the Executive Committee of the Ethiopian Human Rights Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the information received, Ato Assefa Maru was surrounded and shot with a kalashinkov, an automatic gun, and a hand grenade by several policemen on 8 May 1997 while he was walking home in Woreda 12 Kebele 06 to his office in Addis Ababa. It is alleged that the policemen did not order Ato Assefa Maru to stop nor did they fired any warning shots, but deliberately aimed at his head and chest. Following his death his body was searched and his briefcase was taken away by the policemen.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the information received, approximately twenty-five minutes after Ato Assefa Maru, was killed, policemen searched his house and took away tape cassettes and Ethiopian Human Rights Council and ETA papers. At the same time at the ETA office, policemen detained on the premises 34 persons including ETA's leaders and staff as well as others who had gone there for private business. The following day, policemen came back with a search warrant and searched the offices and took away documents, while the staff were denied access to the office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federal Police Investigation Coordination Department has apparently claimed that members of an anti-peace group which calls itself the Ethiopian Unity Patriots Front have been taken into custody and that Ato Assefa Maru, who they claimed had replaced the Front's leader and had been co- ordinating its activities, was shot dead while trying to escape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sources strongly refute the suggestion that Ato Assefa Maru was a member of the Ethiopian Unity Patriots Front.  During the house search, no fire arms were found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action requested: Please write to the Ethiopian Authorities requesting that they:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">i. take immediate action to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of all 34 persons mentioned above;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ii. order their immediate release if they are still detained without valid charges or, if such charges exist, bring them before a competent and impartial tribunal and guarantee their full procedural rights;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">iii. guarantee an impartial and exhaustive enquiry into the death of Ato Assefa Maru and the other events described above, identify those responsible, bring them to trial, and apply the penal, civil, and/or administrative sanctions provided by law;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">iv. take all necessary measures to guarantee the family's right to redress;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">v. ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with national laws and international standards.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maseru - The government of Lesotho will spend about M15 million on production of Voters Registration Cards (VRCs) which will be given to voters for the forthcoming general multi-party elections, the Chief Electoral Officer Mr. Lebohang Tsepane said in Maseru last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The VRCs will be produced to curb the problem of unclear identity during the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not clear whether people will have to pay for the cards, but it is believed that the government will give an explanation on this issue when the Independent Electoral Commission(IEC) is launched.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Issuance of VRCs will be made sometime in March 1998. &quot;Machines will be put in every registration station in each constituency where people will be photographed,&quot; said Tsepane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tsepane said that similar birth dates of many voters appearing in the 1993 voters roll were found to be accurate and correct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tsepane was reacting to the complaints made by some political parties that such birth dates similarities may mean that some dubious deals in the making of the voters roll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that his office re-registered some people to check the accuracy of the roll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Indeed we found out that these were the real dates in which those people were born,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tsepane is also of the idea that holding of both general multi-party elections and local government elections separately will cost the government a lot of money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He argued that funds for the general multi-party election alone are not enough and at the moment he is working on a proposal for funds top- up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief electoral officer said that M15 million was budgeted for the multi-party general elections and about the same amount will be needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This amount is separate to that of VRCs, which means that the government may need about M45 million for the general multi-party election only.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maseru - Continuing our series on juvenile justice in Lesotho this week we look at how juveniles are treated by the law, and in practice.  Mopheme also visited the juvenile wing of the female prison and talked to some of the detainees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young girls who commit crimes in Lesotho are sent to the juvenile wing of the Female Prison in Maseru.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the Juvenile Training Centre for boys, which we reported on recently, the juvenile wing of the Female Prison is a place of rehabilitation, and not supposed to be a prison environment. However unlike the JTC, which has its own grounds the girl's wing is part of the adult prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the girls are treated differently to the adult prisoners - they sleep in a separate dormitory and have access to primary education - they do not have the same vocational and recreational facilities as the boys at the JTC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the 22 girls currently detained at the Girl's Unit have a similar story to tell. Tseli's (not her real name) story is typical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tseli's Story Tseli is one of the young offenders detained at the Girl's Unit of the female prison in Maseru. Since arriving there 6 months ago she has not had a single visitor. Despite the winter coldness Tseli walks around the prison yard barefoot. She has no shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We supply uniforms and blankets and basic toiletries,&quot; explains M'e Machachamise, the Warden, &quot;but we cannot supply shoes. The girls' parents or guardians have to do that. Girls who do not get visits from parents or friends are often without some basic items. We cannot supply underwear or face cloths either. Parents should bring money for the girls to buy these things. If there are no visitors the girl usually does without such items, except what she had when she arrived here.&quot; Tseli's crime is theft, the most common crime among girls. She was a house maid and stole money from her employer. &quot;I worked long hours each and every day, from very early in the morning to late at night&quot;, she says. &quot;The house had eight rooms and I had to look after two children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the six months I was working I never got a day off. I never got to talk to people my own age, except when I was hanging clothes on the washing line. It was very lonely.&quot; Tseli asked for a pay rise but her employer's would not give her one so she stole money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many of the girl's who are sent here are domestics who have stolen from an employer says,&quot; M'e Machachamise. Often they steal because they are not paid. Also you find many of the girls have left their parent's home, perhaps due to some family problems and are on the streets stealing to meet their needs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talking to the girls Mopheme discovered that over half have do not receive regular visits. Eight girls have not had a single visitor since they arrived. Kekeletso (not her real name) arrived at the prison in 1994, when she was 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her crime was stealing M550.00 from a passenger in a taxi. &quot;I don't know why my parents have never visited me,&quot; she says with tears streaming down her face. In three years I have had no visits from anyone. I will go and ask my family to forgive me when I am released but I don't think they will want me back.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maseru - Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle has successfully staged a coup against his own Basutoland Congress Party (BCP) and formed a new one.  The new government was unofficially formed in Parliament yesterday afternoon when Mokhehle asked his supporters in parliament to cross the floor and rally behind him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mokhehle then addressed a press conference before a packed Parliament with MP's and the public, while session adjourned for the afternoon.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, the break time lapsed and time was extended as the National Assembly Sergeant in Arms continously made a reminder that the press conference was held on borrowed time and that Parliament session had to resume.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mokhehle, BCP is old and has finished its job. He said the BCP main task was to get freedom for Basotho and his new party Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) is promote and develop the true democratic governance of the people by the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new government still under the leadership of Mokhehle has been kidnapped by the new party LCD he formed with his supporters at the weekend meeting on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He advised the remaining leadership of the BCP to register as an official opposition in Lesotho Parliament and advise the Speaker of the New Opposition Leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked about his stated intent to leave active politics by the end of the year, Mokhehle said it is not yet the end of the year. He however said though he is ill and old, it does not mean an old man can not work for his children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new party whose slogan is &quot;puso ea sechaba ka sechaba&quot; - government of the people by the people - bears the same colours like the former except that this one has double black and they flying eagle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party leader is Mokhehle, deputised by Pakalitha Mosisili. On the chair is Thebe Motebang assisted by Mopshatla Mabitle. Shakhane Mokhehle rocks the Secretary-Generalship chair of the party assisted by Notsi Molopo. PRO is Pashu Mochesane deputised by Thabiso Melato, Treasurer is Lira Motete, Editor Monyane Moleleki, while members are Makatla Makatla and Kelebone Maope.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maseru - It all started as a mere bickering, or so it appeared. Later it turned out to be a teething-struggle for succession. It then developed into a circus that took almost two years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, instead of laughing, spectators were annoyed while the electorate and supporters suffered indigny of having cast their votes for turncoat politicians in the kraal of Basutoland Congress Party (BCP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The entire leadership of the BCP had long lsot its root. It has lost direction, it has no vision and its future is bleak. In the words of its founder &quot;it is dead.&quot; Dr Ntsu Mokhehle and his deputy Mr Molapo Qhobela had been at loggerheads for the simple questions of power and digging of the past to fuel animosity among members of the BCP to justify their harum scarum political behaviour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks God it did not take them up to the coming 1998 general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blood was smelling when it came to nomination of candidates for the party's constituencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, at last there is solution. Water and paraffin. Followers of the ailing Mokhehle have thrown the towel into the ring because their best boxer is hors de comabt with clout injury. In the meantime, Qhobela, who has also reached the retiring age as far as modern politics is concerned, got what he wanted by clever political horse-trading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mokhehle has desrted and left Qhobela with BCP to exercise his muscles with all ease Qhobel is now the head that wears the crown. No more &quot;tired and old Ntsu, his younger brother and uneducated miners.&quot; Qhobela must show his way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mokhehle is taking a rest. He has opted to punch Qhobela and his henchmen from a distance by forming his new political party, Lesotho Congress Democracy (LCD). The worst part of it is that it has been formed through corrupt means and its formation has cost the public dearly. But it all depends on the opposition and public approval of this corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of public money; several hours which should have been invested to the entire public affairs and public properties have been misused by the government to form a political party. Cabinet ministers have exploited whatever is within their reach in their public offices and official capacities to rob the public for the sake of the new party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cabinet ministers, who are holding their positions on the ticket of BCP have been using day and night public stationery, telephones, electricity, offices, desks and vehicles organising for the formation of the new party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BCP under the leadership of Qhobela, appears to be a bad looser. They have lost their hard-fetched government to LCD. In fact BCP is starting from the scratch to work for a new government, if they have no means to deprive Mokhehle of their entitlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What the leaders of BCP and the new party as well, need now is a serious introspection Reformation of the party with dynamic modern democratic noms that allow diverse participation of members without time frame restrictions toward a truly democratic organisation that will convey democratci principles into government is inevitable to any political organisations aiming to survive in the 20th century. New blood should hold the reins while old blood should hold advisory positions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maseru - Say the Eagle has Landed or say it has flown, depending on where you stand. But, there was yet another political precedence set in Lesotho yesterday which will certainly amaze the whole world. All in all, it appears to have been within the constitutional boundaries of the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some people may not agree that it was a coup, but it was, but from within and a very silent one, and a very clever one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is now becoming evident, from the mouths of the defectors, is that the structures of the Basutoland Congress Party did not allow the fully swing of a democratic existence within the party, and thus the long and queued leadership struggle which went from a court to another court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sad, and very sad indeed that at this eleventh hour, some &quot;goodmen&quot; will come and open the eyes of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Things being where they are now, it is worth challenging the mind, eyes and ears, to make own judgement, as to what has been a problem in the governance of the BCP. Was it the Pressure Group or the Majela-Thoko (Conservatives). Now balancing scale has been put upright and the voters can make their own clear choices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though some political analysts are already foreseeing a political setback, which could somehow develop into a hectic confusion for Basotho, others say in the name of democracy and progress towards the development of democratic structures in the country, things could not have come at this better moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by the look of things, the new party may experience good support, and then until, as some critics see it, when the old man retires from active politics, then like in some other political parties, like Basotho National Party and National Progressive Party, candidates would be making empty promises to the people in the name of the good past....</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This and others have been very surprising moves in Lesotho politics, that instead of set philosophies and ideologies, politicians turn to believe and propagate their canvassing around personalities and may be to some extent had gotten good votes...!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Dr. Mokhehle has stated that he is forming the new party for his children (supporters), it will not be surprising that even after he has completely quit, his name would still feature prominently his children's campaigns for being elected, as if he would still be in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The struggle for power had almost gotten too much into the voters disillusioned hearts and the absolute split will certainly rekindle some political competitiveness, even though the competition results will be drawn from leading personalities and not on promises and set policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, come 1998, and what will be born of that new era may be a total disaster for the nation or a total breakthrough in Lesotho's political stability and good democratic governance. The nation has been placed in a make it or break type of situation, and if until now the smaller opposition parties (as they are always called) are still fast asleep, they will be dealt like those girls in the Bible who forgot to fill their lamps with oil before the bride came, and they will never ever be allowed in.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maseru - The new Maseru City Council is to be congratulated for taking up its job seriously. They want to make a clean sweep of Maseru City by implementing livestock control regulations (Mopheme June 3-9, 1997).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulations are a colonial baggage which merit thorough review before prosecuting livestock owners who do not heed MCC's appeal to observe the regulations. Their implementation has eluded past administrations since 1966. The MCC, in a democratic administration, should save itself the embarrassment of its predecessors by appearing like a toothless bulldog.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surprisingly, city livestock have a lot in common with city prostitutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And city' is understood to include the expansive Maseru peri-urban areas where many poor women keep one or two dairy cows and few chickens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both livestock and prostitutes in the city are a product of poverty, and therefore invoke a sense of compassion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are also a product of male affluence; and since the affluent often call the shots, the MCC might find itself banging its head against a brick wall. Keeping livestock and engaging in prostitution are a male pastime. The former has cultural underpinnings. This is why a cow or any bovine is culturally elevated to molimo o nko e metsi' (a god with a wet nose!) On the other hand, male clients in prostitution trade merely express Freudian instinct of male dominance over and subordination of the female. Like with the animals which cohabit with their partners instinctively, the end result is promiscuity with all its implications such as infection with AIDS, for humans, and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the city livestock unlike their counterparts, pose no threat to spread of this scourge of diseases, it would be reasonable, if not prudent, for MCC to re-examine its priorities. Control of STDs is a much more pressing and urgent problem in Maseru city than livestock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Director of Parks and Recreation, Mrs Leratang Monare, may be correct in reminding the public that &quot;livestock control regulations within the city are necessary in the interests of public health, reduction of traffic hazards---------&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the moonlight' ladies are a worse traffic hazard and menace especially after drinking away their earnings and invading, in their drunken stupor, dangerously speeding motorists. Saving their life from physical injury and from being a reservoir of STDs is a much more urgent humanitarian act of compassion than immediate concern for livestock in the city. At least, livestock is never seen staggering around the streets, Mountain Brewery has not done enough marketing yet! These observations should not be misconstrued to imply condoning keeping of livestock in the city. Rather, the intention is to convey a sense of balance in the approach to our city's problems and for MCC to reassess its priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is nothing wrong with MCC attempting to emulate the not-so-poor cities like some of Johannesburg's wealthy suburbs studded with horse stables and dairy farms; Zurich's hilly and exclusive periurban residences overlooking clean Brown Swiss cowsheds; Lago's market centres where roaming goats appear to coexist happily with marketeers; or Nairobi city's lush greenery meticulously mowed by majestic Masai's herds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in poor Lesotho, colonial regulations &quot;prohibit livestock in government proprieties in the city centre and in properties below one acre. Properties of one acre and above are allowed two large livestock, and livestock such as sheep, goats, pigs, oxen and donkeys are prohibited&quot; Government property, what of police stables and MCC animal slaughterhouse? Livestock was prohibited in properties below one acre because during the colonial days only Basotho lived in such properties while the masters who lived in mini-farms in the city could keep two large stock, usually a cow and a horse for pleasure riding. As for other classes of livestock which poor Mosotho could keep, there was a total ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What will MCC do about large poultry units in the city? And dogs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maseru - A young priest got terrified. He feared for his life as he saw a 9mm firearm being pulled out of the hotel room cabinet drawer.  Glancing at the fatal weapon, he could smell death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Father Antony &quot;Scar&quot; Monyau of the diocesan order of priests at Our Lady of Victories - Mofumahali oa Tlholo- was being interrogated in room 453 of the Hotel Victoria on Lt. Phakiso Molise's skipping the country to seek asylum in the neighbouring South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Far from any suspicion, the priest was asked by police officer Major George Mofolo in a telephone conversation to phone the latter's colleague officer Kizito Mhlakaza who was obviously booked at the Victoria Hotel, a member of the Lesotho Hotels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He asked me to meet him at the hotel. When I entered the room I found him with two other people- a woman and a man- whom I suspected were also policemen. As I got in, the other dashed out,&quot; said Monyau in an exclusive interview with Mopheme-The Survivor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him the young police officer, a product of the St.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Augustine's Seminary which also groomed Monyau to the priesthood said Molise &quot;has talked and said you helped him skip the country, adding that what we did was not good and wanted to know if we did so under any instructions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He told me he was the only one to pull us out of the menace as the issue was dangerous,&quot; noted Monyau who categorically denied any links with Molise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later on after an hour interrogation that started at 7.00pm, Mhlakaza wisely lured the celibate to accompany the woman. Instead he offered them a M30 to pay for a night cab to ferry them to their places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the trio got out of the hotel room, Mhlakaza pulled a gun out of a drawer, a move that swiftly hurled the priest into uncertainty and fear for death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I said if anything happens the woman will have to testify. She said we'll only be two when we return from accompanying her.&quot; But the policeman silently hang his weapon on the-----.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventually the suspecting priest, in company with Mhlakaza, drove his Golf model car to ferry the police woman to Florida estates, after which he drove back his interrogator to the hotel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In yet another shocking incident, the priest was again interrogated by Major Mofolo, one Lt. Matsoso who is a member of the thriving Catholic Life Group (CLG) at Our Lady of Victories and their colleague one Matona. He was told he had dug his finger on police issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I asked him what they meant because on that day in question- February 16- I was conducting mass at the Lesotho Defence Force (LDF) barracks at which I asked the congregation to pray for peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aggressive policemen, who were bitterly coughing out a spree of questions to the suspect, wanted to know if he knew Molise. He said he had only seen his photograph on Moeletsi oa Basotho newspaper, adding &quot;I was familiar with the face.&quot; After he strongly warned them that it would the first time to arrest a priest in a democratic rule, Matsoso wondered how they would protect the church if &quot;we didn't tell the truth,&quot; and they asked him to act respectably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He questioned them as to why they were not making inquiries from the Palace for the fact that the government had announced Molise was hiding there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had also been asked if he knew one Fr Khoza of Ladybrand South Africa, who is alleged to have also assisted in fleeing Molise from the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another priest who has also been wrecked by police unwarranted fury is Rev Patrick Sekome, also a diocesan priest at the Cathedral of Our Lady of Victories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was suspected to have given shelter to Molise and Sergeant Thabang Makateng who is still at large and helped them skip the country to take refuge in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Fr. Sekome, who studied at the St. Augustine's Seminary together with Mhlakaza, a graduate in Bachelor of Philosophy, Major Mofolo and policeman Matona told him their four sources confirmed that he was allegedly involved in sneaking out the two policemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They said Archbishop Bernard Mohlalisi had said Makateng might have been at his house because he found the latter's note requesting to be linked with lawyers. I told them if that was so I would have known because I work under Archbishop Mohlalisi. I also told them that some people have severely suffered because of lies and that we were aware some of the police officers were plotting to assassinate us.&quot; He then asked them why they did not enquire from the Palace where Molise was suspected to be taking refuge. A third priest who also toiled under police wrath is Fr Augustinus Mahlaku. He was also questioned on any links with Molise and Makateng's fleeing the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Royal Lesotho Mounted Police head of press section Captain Sekoateng Serabele said the names of the priests were mentioned by the people who were interviewed by the police during their investigations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not that they were regarded as criminals. We just wanted them to say what they knew and they have denied any links,&quot; he told Mopheme- The Survivor last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if conducting an interview in a hotel room was a normal practice, he said as long as policeman wanted to get information he &quot;can conduct his interview at any place&quot;, but added that the meeting might have been on friendly basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He denied the newspaper any access to interview the policemen who interrogated the church ministers saying &quot;that might jeopardize ongoing investigations,&quot; and added that could not happen because those police officers are not public relation officers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maseru - Tensions mounted the whole of yesterday morning in the National Assembly as members awaited the announcement of a new political party formed by the Prime Minister Dr. Ntsu Mokhehle and his supporters at the Saturday meeting held at the Cooperatives College in Maseru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The long wait seemed not to come to an end as MPs started using harsh language attacks against each other while debates on Amendment Bill on 1970's Dismissed Public Servants were on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of Parliament alike members of the public were not sure as to whether Prime Minister Mokhehle would resign with his supporters from government and form an opposition in parliament. But, there was sure an important announcement to be made and all waited crossing their fingers .for a tail of head.....</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As at that time there seemed to be any possible move, even members of the BCP Pressure Group did not move about much or stray in case they had to form a new government in a drama.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was only in the afternoon when MPs were unofficially asked to cross the floor with the new government that it bacame clear that the Prime Minster had within the provisions of the Constitution - if that be - staged a coup against his own government and formed a new one, without shaking any constitutional democratic foundations...! The formation of the new party by Mokhehle and others was viewed by many critics as a win by the Pressure Group, and this was followed by jubilations and celebrations throughout the weekend by the BCP non-supporters of Mokhehle. But, in Mokhehle's words, it looks like it's a win over nothing...! Mokhehle said during the press conference yesterday afternoon, there was a struggle for executive positions in the BCP, but now that they have left, the new BCP leadership has been left with empty seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mokhehle does not however want to dictate the fate of the BCP. He had said it has done its job well and now it is old. It fought for the freedom of Basotho and that has been achieved, what is needed now is the promotion and expansion of the democratic strutures within the political set up of Lesotho so that Basotho can taste a fair and good democratic governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some critics say it is too late for the old man to realize that the goals and objectives that his former party - that he, himself, founded over forty years ago - were pursuing are overtaken by time, they feel he has done more damage to himself that he thinks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some argue that it would now be difficult for the electorate to put total trust to a man who is one day shouting ride-on and the next day whispering pull back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, as critics and opinions would come from all sides without fail, the only final test that both Mokhehle and Qhobela now in their different corners, have to face is the man in the village, the woman in the street, the teenager at school, and everybody who can cast a vote in Lesotho. The answer is not far from being found, .....come 1998 and the people will make their choice...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Molapo Qhobela's words, Mokhehle's quit &quot;...has been such a bloody good riddance...&quot; and continues that the rock that has always been on the way for the BCP to move ahead has now been removed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He however said the BCP Executive will now accept the provocation by Mokhehle that they should register as an official opposition in parliament. &quot;We are not to fall for that bribe package,&quot; said Qhobela who further added that the BCP won elections in 1993, and that all members of the National Assembly except one (Bofihla Nkuebe) were voted by BCP. He said Dr. Mokhehle is only trying to turn things up-side-down, while he himself should register for the official opposition and not the ruling party which won elections in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Qhobela said BCP now has one turn to normalise the leadership and observe the High Court rulings which will observed by the holding of the party national conference on July 26-27, 1997, and from there they are not looking back but are going forward into the villages and towns and continue with politicking.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA - In Ethiopia and other countries in similar stages of development where the economy is mostly based on farm products, land is an &quot;indispensable natural resource,&quot; it was noted by the minister of Agriculture yesterday when opening a four-day workshop on rural land use and forest conservation policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proper use of land depends on periodic survey of the potentials of a certain region and its utilization for years without damaging its productivity, Dr. Seifu Ketema said. due to lack of rural land use and forest conservation strategies in the past, however, different natural resources have been exposed to uncontained have been exposed to uncontained deterioration or damage in the highland areas where agricultural development is extensive, the Minister pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the minister, the survey carried out in 1978 in these areas indicated that 2 million hectares of land were exposed to excessive damage and have since become unproductive. Some 14 million hectares of land have meantime been badly eroded whereas 27 million hectares have been exposed to partial soil erosion and degradation, he said, adding that an estimated 2 billion metric tones of soil are being washed away to neighboring countries every year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister also noted that the dense forests which covered as much as 40% of the country's land surface a century ago have since been reduced to 2.7% and the annual deforestation rate stands at 200,000 hectares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Tamiru Habte, head of the Forestry and Wildlife, Soil and Land use Technology and Regulatory Department, said earlier that studies showed that if the present rate of deforestation continues Ethiopia will be without any forest stands by the year 2004. The annual loss of forests is estimated at birr 65 million (10 million dollars), he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to both officials, the draft document on proposed policy and strategies is meant to find lasting solutions to these and related problems the country is encountering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also called on the participants of the workshop to thoroughly discuss the draft document and come up with appropriate suggestions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. George Kasberger, GTZ-Project Advisory Assistance to the forest Administration, on his part widely elaborated on the importance of forestry based on the experiences of the Federal Republic of Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Kasberger also elaborated on some key issues relevant to the current situation in Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 53 department and bureau heads, team leaders and experts representing the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples, Oromia, Afar, Dire Dawa, Region 14, Benshangul-Gumuz and Harari as well as invited guests were present during the opening session.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA - In Ethiopia and other countries in similar stages of development where the economy is mostly based on farm products, land is an &quot;indispensable natural resource,&quot; it was noted by the minister of Agriculture yesterday when opening a four-day workshop on rural land use and forest conservation policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proper use of land depends on periodic survey of the potentials of a certain region and its utilization for years without damaging its productivity, Dr. Seifu Ketema said. due to lack of rural land use and forest conservation strategies in the past, however, different natural resources have been exposed to uncontained have been exposed to uncontained deterioration or damage in the highland areas where agricultural development is extensive, the Minister pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the minister, the survey carried out in 1978 in these areas indicated that 2 million hectares of land were exposed to excessive damage and have since become unproductive. Some 14 million hectares of land have meantime been badly eroded whereas 27 million hectares have been exposed to partial soil erosion and degradation, he said, adding that an estimated 2 billion metric tones of soil are being washed away to neighboring countries every year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister also noted that the dense forests which covered as much as 40% of the country's land surface a century ago have since been reduced to 2.7% and the annual deforestation rate stands at 200,000 hectares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Tamiru Habte, head of the Forestry and Wildlife, Soil and Land use Technology and Regulatory Department, said earlier that studies showed that if the present rate of deforestation continues Ethiopia will be without any forest stands by the year 2004. The annual loss of forests is estimated at birr 65 million (10 million dollars), he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to both officials, the draft document on proposed policy and strategies is meant to find lasting solutions to these and related problems the country is encountering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also called on the participants of the workshop to thoroughly discuss the draft document and come up with appropriate suggestions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. George Kasberger, GTZ-Project Advisory Assistance to the forest Administration, on his part widely elaborated on the importance of forestry based on the experiences of the Federal Republic of Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Kasberger also elaborated on some key issues relevant to the current situation in Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 53 department and bureau heads, team leaders and experts representing the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples, Oromia, Afar, Dire Dawa, Region 14, Benshangul-Gumuz and Harari as well as invited guests were present during the opening session.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Returns from the top five Zimbabwean stocks dropped during the first five months of 1997 under heavy selling pressure from investors, analysts said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The market analyst, Dataworld Nominees, said in its latest newsletter that Zimbabwe was now ranked 13th out of 27 emerging markets in terms of the performance of the top five stocks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the month of May 1997, the country was ranked the fifth worst performer,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) has been reeling under selling pressure since April. This has been due to profit-taking by investors after announcement of the controversial central bank decision on transfer of dual quoted shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its latest report on emerging markets, the International Finance Corporation says that the Zimbabwe Stock Market's performance, so far this year, in terms of the Investable Indexes, was 17.4 percent in United States dollar terms. Its returns, based on the broader based Global Indexes measure, was 10.7 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Investable Index is based on price movements in the top five capitalised shares on the ZSE, while the Global Index is calculated on 22 stocks selected from industrial and mining counters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The top five capitalised stocks are Delta, Barclays, Bindura, Zimsun and Wankie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the revival of the watershed Industrial Index continued Wednesday following another day of robust performance by the heavyweights, First Merchant Bank and Caps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two counters surged ahead 200 and 100 cents to close at 4,100 and 2,700 cents respectively, movements which pushed the index 64 to 10,294.28 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday's increase meant the 59-counter index has gained 230 points or 2 percent since Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mining Index put on nearly two points to close at 999.70.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species secretariat has conditionally accepted the proposal by three Southern African countries to remove the elephant from the list of endangered species.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a document to be discussed by some 1,500 delegates attending the meeting in Harare, Zimbabwe, the secretariat accepted proposals by Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe. These countries are calling for limited trade in ivory stocks which have accumulated since 1989 but gave conditions which, first, must be met.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The countries propose that the conference of parties approve export quotas for a specified period of 1998 and 1999 of existing registered stocks of raw ivory for the exclusive purpose of disposing of accumulated ivory stocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The secretariat noted that the three countries had proposed procedures and conditions for the export of ivory stocks, limited quantities and limited number of shipments, as well as inspection of shipments by any adherents to the convention, including the secretariat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document says trade in live animals, hunting trophies, hides and non-commercial personal effects as proposed by Zimbabwe was unobjectionable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The African population in Namibia is stable and those in Botswana and Zimbabwe is increasing,&quot; the secretariat said. &quot;Although there is concern about funding for anti-poaching activities in Zimbabwe, there is no basis for predicting a decline in population.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Southern Africa has a 300,000-kilogram stockpile of ivory. This accounts for at least half of all of Africa's stocks and could generate at least 330 million zimdollars (30 million U.S. dollars).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe are proposing that elephants be moved from the endangered species list from Appendix I to Appendix II, which allows for controlled trade in elephant products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although optimistic, Zimbabwean officials said they feared that some countries would not support the downlisting because of threats from some non-governmental organizations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK, United Nations (PANA) - A military showdown with a combined West African force is likely the main fear of the junior officers who toppled Sierra Leone's democratically-elected government May 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while the Nigerian-led forces are deploying and efforts continue to seek a negotiated solution to the crisis, the putschists face another formidable foe: James Jonah, Sierra Leone's United Nations envoy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the coup halted Sierra Leone's slow recovery from years of civil war and cut short its fledgling democracy, Jonah has embarked on a diplomatic offensive to deny international recognition to the new military leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the United Nations, where he retired in 1994 after some 30 years of service, to the Organization of African Unity and the Economic Community of West African States, Jonah has tapped his wide-ranging contacts in seeking to isolate the coup plotters and their rebel allies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the just-concluded Africa summit in Harare, Zimbabwe, where the Sierra Leonean diplomat represented his country, he succeeded in obtaining a strong O.A.U. condemnation of the coup. The organization also supported possible military action to reverse the coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jonah has also succeeded in putting the soldiers on the defensive by alleging, at a meeting Monday with the president of the U.N. Security Council, that the coup leaders were planning genocide against supporters of the ousted president, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jonah asked the council to issue a warning to the soldiers and to set up an ad-hoc tribunal to try the putschists &quot;if any harm should come to the people of Sierra Leone&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The credibility of the soldiers has also been severely dented by reports that the soldiers have asked for a 46-million-U.S.-dollar pay- off to step down and allow Tejan Kabbah to return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To show his utter disdain for the coup makers, Jonah has used an arsenal of scathing words, describing them variously as &quot;renegade soldiers&quot;, &quot;a little bunch of illiterate thugs&quot; and a &quot;group of pretenders masquerading as the government of my country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He even called them &quot;naive&quot; for daring to recall him, in the wake of the coup, as Sierra Leone's permanent representative to the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Jonah, unusually blunt for a diplomat, has also attacked the media, which he has used effectively since the coup, or any group he perceived as seeking to delay a reversal of the coup, the country's third in five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his second press conference since the coup, at the UN headquarters in New York, he lambasted the media Monday for &quot;not accurately reporting&quot; the shelling of Sierra Leone's military headquarters by Nigerian gunboats last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jonah said the media &quot;missed the point&quot; in focusing on an alleged retreat by Nigerian forces rather than the &quot;inhuman action&quot; by the coup plotters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also accused the British charity group, International Alert, which tried to mediate in the crisis, of seeking to &quot;strengthen&quot; the coup by seeking Security Council involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) should seek the council's mandate before using force in Sierra Leone, he said: &quot;We don't need to do that because Ecowas has demonstrated that it is a credible regional organization, more than any of them (Security Council members) have done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jonah, 63, may have every reason to be angry. Since his retirement he has devoted his time and energy to his country, presiding over a successful political transition as chairman of Sierra Leone's interim national electoral commission and participating in reconciliation efforts as a member of the country's National Security Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, faced with the prospect of another transition program under the regime of Maj. Johnny Koromah, which has asked to stay in power for 18 months, Jonah's fuse is very short.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We in Sierra Leone are tired of military regimes,&quot; he said. &quot;We cannot spare the time to tolerate this new military coup.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I urgently appeal to all sides to the conflict to agree to an immediate cease-fire and begin negotiations,&quot; Mugabe, also Zimbabwe's president, said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In calling for an end to the hostilities, we are mindful of the elections scheduled for July 27 where the people of Congo should be allowed to make their democratic choice in an environment free of violence,&quot; Mugabe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence broke out Thursday when the army attacked the home of former President Denis Sassou-Nguesso, in an effort to disarm his militia.  Sassou-Nguesso, a former army officer, intends to contest the elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The ANC in KwaZulu Natal is not surprised by the negative response of the National Party and the Democratic Party in KwaZulu Natal as articulated by Danie Schutte and Wessel Nel respectively, towards the ANC proposed Peace Package. Indeed, the response of these white racist parties is a clear indication that we are on the correct track.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the proposal had received the support of the NP and DP then there would have been something fundamentally wrong with the ANC's Peace Package.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These tiny white racist parties would be obliterated from the political scene of KwaZulu Natal if the political violence which only consumes African lives were to come to an end. Political violence is in the political interest and the main reason for the continued political existence of the NP and DP in KwaZulu Natal. It is therefore in their interest to keep on fanning the fires of violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For them the killings of Africans is like watching an interesting film. The negative comments by Mr Bantubonke Holomisa were also expected. It further exposes who Holomisa is - a former leader of a bantustan system whose main thrust was to divide, rule and kill Africans. Holomisa, true to the bantustan system he was part of, would want to see more Africans being killed in KwaZulu Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyway, Holomisa cannot pretend forever. He has finally found his real place, the arm pit of Roelf Meyer. Mr Roelf Meyer as the former Deputy-Minister of Police is in an advantageous position. At the Deputy- Minister of Police he was privy to know all the agents of the apartheid regime's security forces. He may have already started to regroup these agents under his arm pit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - The Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) and twenty-two religious and secular organizations have issued a statement calling on the leaders of industrialized nations to consult with Africans before making policy decisions which affect African nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The heads of government of the Group of Seven (G7) countries Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States will hold their annual economic summit in Denver, Colorado from June 20 to June 22. The event has become known as the Denver Summit of Eight in recognition of the inclusion of the Russian leader, Boris Yeltsin, in most of the summit deliberations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Summit participants are expected to consider measures to promote economic liberalization in Africa and to accelerate the integration of African nations into global economic networks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CBC and the organizational endorsers of the statement, &quot;Africa and the Denver Economic Summit,&quot; insist that African representatives should be take part in reaching decisions that directly affect African nations. They fear that, otherwise, the Summit will repeat the errors of the 1884-84 Berlin Conference, at which the major European powers and the United States carved up the African continent, establishing colonial enclaves and imposing commercial regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TEXT OF STATEMENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa and the Denver Economic Summit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We applaud the industrialized nations participating in the Denver Summit of Eight for the decision to pay particular attention to Africa.  However, we greatly regret that the participants will have no opportunity to consult directly with African officials. If Africa is to be on the agenda, Africans should be at the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is imperative that the Denver Summit of Eight not become a modern- day Berlin Conference at which powerful nations make decisions about Africa's future without consulting Africans themselves. Africans across the continent are initiating projects and debating policies consistently and constructively. We urge policy makers to recognize these developments and to establish a mechanism to facilitate systematic consultation with all those whose lives will be affected by the choices made. This requires that the summit participants initiate a dialogue that involves not only their counterparts in African governments, but also a broad cross-section of African public, private, and civil society sector representatives. We hope that such discussions would develop a comprehensive program of action for consideration at the 1998 economic summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We recognize that Africans do not speak with one voice, nor are all individuals and groups equally well-equipped to make their voices heard.  Consequently, a particular effort must be made to consult with those who typically find themselves on the political and economic periphery: rural dwellers, women, workers, youth, the unemployed, elderly, and disabled.  We fear that, in the absence of these perspectives, certain principles fundamental to policy development and assessment will be ignored. These include criteria that have already emerged from our own discussions with African community and civil society organizations and that resonate with our experiences in domestic struggles for social and economic justice:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The single most important question which must be asked about any Africa initiative, whether multilateral or bilateral, is: What impact will the action have on Africa's economically poor majorities and the most marginalized sectors of each society?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Programs and policies should be designed to produce explicit, tangible benefits for poor communities. It should never be assumed that benefits will &quot;trickle down&quot; from the economically or politically powerful to the marginalized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Action must be undertaken simultaneously on a number of fronts and policies must interlock to form a coherent and comprehensive whole.  Initiatives in one area must not be undermined by action (or inaction) in another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. All multilateral and bilateral initiatives should facilitate and model increased popular participation in decision making, greater accountability of officials, and improved transparency. Such &quot;process&quot; concerns should take precedence over a rigid insistence on any particular economic regime.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - While most Cape clothing manufacturers are struggling in tough market conditions, uniform supplier Sparks &amp; Ellis is farming out a large chunk of its production to keep up with demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sparks &amp; Ellis, a subsidiary of Cape Union Mart, is the oldest supplier of law enforcement and corporate security uniforms in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leonard Jocum, Sparks &amp; Ellis' director of marketing and procurement, said the company had decided to go the outsourcing route some four years ago when it was awarded a major contract by Telkom.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So far this year 30 percent of our manufacturing has taken place outside our own manufacturing facility, either to organisations that we have seen grow into medium sized factories, or to individuals who perform the more specialist tasks for us such as the embroidery on an officer's peak cap.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Jocum believed that this was true empowerment, creating employment and capital among disadvantaged communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people we are dealing with are probably not going to fill out state tender forms because they don't have the capacity to handle the volume - if we can help them get the volume through the group - that is empowering them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sparks &amp; Ellis first outsourcing venture was with Cheryl Masoet, a supervisor at a clothing factory who had been laid off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Masoet began her business with six employees out of her garage at home, and has seen her business, Eez Clothing, graduate to a small factory in Lansdowne with 15 employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eez Clothing produces parka jackets and other warm clothing for Sparks &amp; Ellis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here Sparks &amp; Ellis learned its first lesson, sending back the first batch of clothing because it did not meet specification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We realised we had to give continual support and training and, in some cases, lend them machines to perform certain tasks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now when we run training sessions for our own staff, we ask these suppliers to send any of their own staff along.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vivian de Klerk, the proprietor of Vestido Clothing, which has been producing for Sparks &amp; Ellis for the past four years, said the group's support had helped his business grow into a medium sized factory employing 100 staff members.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - In the old system of education, schools were controlled in an authoritarian and fragmented way. Teachers, pupils and parents had very little say in how schools were run and even less say in the policy- making process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The introduction of the Schools Act in January this year brought hope to parents, teachers and pupils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The act demands that all public schools introduce representative and democratically elected governing bodies to replace the old (sometimes unrepresentative) structures which were in place at schools.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aim of the new governing bodies is to involve parents and make sure they take part in decisions affecting the education of their children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governing bodies will have the power to decide on admissions, religion and language policies, a code of conduct for learners (pupils) and school hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will also control the school property and buildings and support the work of the principal and educators (teachers).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Governing bodies will have to supplement State funding by raising money or charging fees, or both, and will be responsible for improving educational equality at the school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governing body membership will consist of three groups of people - the elected members, the school principal and co-opted members. The elected members are parents of learners at the school, educators at the school, administrative staff - including gardeners - and learners at the school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The co-opted members will be members of the community and owners of school property, or their representatives, if the property is privately owned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Schools Act stipulates that the number of parents on any governing body must be one more than half of all the members who may vote. Parents who are employed at a school cannot represent parents on a governing body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Co-opted members are optional and are there to help the governing body with its functions. They may not vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Learners on the governing body must be elected by the representative council of learners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of members on a governing body will vary from one school to another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provincial education authorities will tell schools in each province the exact composition of their governing bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A governing body must elect office bearers, including at least a chairperson, treasurer and secretary. A parent may only be chairperson of a governing body if he or she is not employed at the school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Membership of the body is for a limited period of time - no longer than three years for a member other than a learner and not more than a year for a learner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new governing bodies will perform the functions of their predecessors until they begin functioning under the Schools Act on a date to be decided on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For their part, the provincial education ministers must ensure that school principals and officers of the education department help governing bodies perform functions specified under the Schools Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governing body may allow the reasonable use of school facilities for community, social or school fundraising purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A governing body may be allocated additional tasks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a governing body wants additional tasks, it must apply in writing to the provincial education minister, who may refuse to give permission for the extra tasks to be taken on, and may also withdraw a function of a governing body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In emergency cases, the provincial head of department may withdraw a function without communicating the decision as long as he or she gives the governing body reasons, reasonable opportunity to make representations and duly considers the representations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provincial head of department can suspend this action, and any person aggrieved by the decision can appeal against it. If a governing body ceases to function, the provincial head of department must appoint someone to perform its functions for not more than three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This period can be extended by three months, but the total period cannot be more than a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A member of a governing body is obliged to withdraw from a meeting if any issue in which he or she has a personal interest is being discussed and decided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expenses incurred by governing body members in performing their duties may be reimbursed by the governing body.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Police in the Western Cape have set strict new crime reduction targets and have identified crimes that will be given special attention this year</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slowly, but inexorably, a coherent and credible plan to fight crime seems to be emerging. The lifting of the moratorium on recruitment for the SAPS, the appointment of a high-powered executive from the private sector to reorganise and manage the police and, most recently, the setting of crime fighting priorities and crime reduction targets in the Western Cape, all point to the measured implementation of a national police strategy to deal with what is the country's most disturbing problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Western Cape the plan has been finely honed. Housebreakings, thefts from motor vehicles and the confiscation of illegal drugs and firearms will be among the crimes which will be specially targeted this year. And in each crime category, specific targets have been set for the number of arrests. At the same time the police hope to reduce by 20 percent the number of cases withdrawn in the region's courts due to incomplete police investigations. This approach makes maximum use of police manpower and resources and appears to offer the prospect of effective action against at least the most prevalent crimes in the region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there can be no long-lasting solution to the scourge of crime while the two other legs of the criminal justice system - the courts and Correctional Services - remain seriously handicapped by a lack of funds and manpower. This week the Department of Justice warned that it might have to limit its activities because of a critical lack of staff and funding, and the premature release of prisoners points to chronic overcrowding and staff shortages in the country's prisons. These problems will have to be addressed urgently and purposefully as a logical extension of the national crime strategy now being put into effect by the police.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - On meeting Desire Samaai, soloist and principal dancer with the Cape Town City Ballet, people invariably ask &quot;but what do you really do? Just dance?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So then I tell them what my working day is like, from start to finish,&quot; says this petite professional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not an easy day, either. If the company isn't performing, they do class from 10am until 6pm, and that's hard physical work in itself.  If they are performing, they work and rehearse until it's time to go to the Nico to get ready for the evening's performance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They do all their make-up and accessories themselves, then it's curtain up at 8pm, perform until 10.20pm, and after that they put all their costumes away safely for the next day. Only then can they take their aching bodies home to rest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The life of a professional ballet dancer is extremely demanding. Like sportsmen, they have to be in peak physical condition all the time. It's a rigorous and exacting discipline, where perfection is the goal.  Besides mastering the difficult technique of classical dance, they also have to learn to act, as their expression and interpretation of their roles is all important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Desire Samaai is the first dancer in the Cape Town City Ballet company to be adopted. It's called the Adopt-a-Dancer campaign, and the idea is to get a business to sponsor pointe shoes for the women dancers.  Liz McGrath, owner of The Cellars Hohenort and The Plettenberg hotels, was the first to take up the challenge, sponsoring Desire's pointe shoes for a year by donating R6 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Desire hopes it will set the ball rolling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Shoes are the most important things that a lady dancer needs. A dud pair can make or break a performance. A huge part of City Ballet's money goes towards shoes. We get 24 pairs per annum, which is two a month.  It's quite shocking, really, as overseas girls get 10 or 12 pairs a month!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bear in mind that some roles can take a pair a performance,&quot; she adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Desire was born in Paarl and matriculated at the Klein Nederburg Senior Secondary School. She started dancing at the age of 8 and joined the UCT Ballet School after matric. Originally, she had planned to be a ballet teacher, but auditioned for Capab Ballet (now Cape Town City Ballet) and was accepted. She has been with the company since 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not sure what decided me to dance,&quot; she says. &quot;I guess I just kept going, inspired by performances I saw and by my teachers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her family initially felt that teaching would be a more secure profession - a career in the performing arts is a risk, and they felt that a dancer's performing life is very short.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are plagued by injury,&quot; Desire points out, &quot;and because our performing life is over quite soon, we're all forced to look at something else in the long term. Also, it's not a very lucrative profession in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the moment, Desire is a rising star in the City Ballet company, and it's probably quite a while before she'll have to consider doing anything else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reason I enjoy dance so much is the feeling of achievement it gives me. As a dancer, no matter who or how good you are, you'll never achieve perfection, you can only try your best and start each day all over again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Desire is satisfied with her career here. She's not harbouring ambitions to dance overseas, she believes that it's a bit late in her career, and frankly thinks she's too short, anyhow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most overseas companies like dancers taller than me. I'm 5ft 2inches, and the French companies start at 5ft 6 inches. Also, I'm quite old for a dancer - I'm 27.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a worrying time for professional dancers now. If private sponsorship is not forthcoming, the Cape Town City Ballet may be forced to close its doors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's so important that we get sponsorship. If only people realised how important private funding is. We can't not have a ballet company in Cape Town. We have the audiences. If the government allowed business tax relief for sponsorships to the arts it would make it easier, too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To take part in the Cape Town City Ballet Adopt A Dancer campaign, the company can be reached on tel 689 4346.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - A high-powered Business Against Crime initiative, spurred in part by the Olympic bid, is to be launched in Cape Town today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BAC initiative will effectively channel private sector expertise and resources into the anti-crime drive, and is likely to enlist support from all key sectors of the province's economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it follows the pattern established elsewhere, a four-pronged strategy will cover short and long-term objectives - fighting crime; researching and advising the Government on legislative measures; developing initiatives to secure economic upliftment; and steps to achieve community rehabilitation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's launch will be attended by Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi, and his Western Cape counterpart, Gerald Morkel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Who's Who of prominent city business executives, as well as top city and provincial government officials, will serve on the BAC board.  Bid Company chief executive Chris Ball will also be a member of the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crime was highlighted by the International Olympic Committee in March as one of several key concerns about Cape Town's bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although individual IOC members have indicated that they do not consider crime an impediment to the city's Olympic hopes, the bid team has sought to use the Games project to promote strategies aimed at improving security and curbing crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Pemberthy, co-ordinator of the bid team's security task group, and a key figure in the BAC project, said success in fighting crime would depend on measurable strategies to boost policing as well as to tackle the causes of crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Highlighting the benefits of business-backed initiatives, he noted: &quot;These are not people who stand on ceremony. They want things done. They ask two things: what's to be done, and when? Their role will be to identify practical steps and find the resources to achieve them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Pemberthy added: &quot;The bid, the police and the business sector have joined hands to work together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Law enforcement will always be the responsibility of the police, but they need help.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - International Olympic Committee visitors from France and Switzerland left the city today with a &quot;very positive impression&quot; and certainty about Cape Town's capacity to organise a technically good, secure Games in 2004.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they made it clear that hosting the Games was an awesome challenge that meant &quot;everyone has to pull in the same direction&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, their overall impression was &quot;fantastic&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This could be a good Olympic city,&quot; said French IOC member and chief executive of the Tour de France, Jean-Claude Killy, who also spoke on behalf of his Swiss counterpart, Rene Fasel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Mr Killy and Mr Fasel - who is also president of the International Ice Hockey Federation - became IOC members in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Killy noted the &quot;professionalism&quot; in the bid team and that the proposal was &quot;compact&quot; and &quot;makes sense, technically&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We came with two concerns,&quot; he said. &quot;We wanted to be reassured about your capacity to organise the games and we wanted to be assured that the games would be well secured, that there would be security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And, yes, absolutely, those conditions have been met.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;We know there are problems, but what country does not have problems today?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if Africa's exclusion from hosting the Games so far was a significant factor, Mr Killy replied: &quot;The Olympics is well represented throughout the world. But I think it is important that nobody is left out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;I expected this city to be exactly what I saw in the Bid Book. But the beauty is absolutely breathtaking. We flew over Cape Point, and it is absolutely magnificent.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Attempts by gang leader Colin Stanfield to avoid tax evasion charges, by taking advantage of the Government's tax amnesty, have failed after he allegedly under-declared his income to the Receiver of Revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year Western Cape Attorney-General Frank Kahn said he would use the &quot;Capone option&quot; to bust drug dealers for tax evasion. At the time he was investigating charges against Mr Stanfield for allegedly owing the revenue services R10-million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government's amnesty policy, which allowed defaulters to register as taxpayers without being prosecuted, raised the possibility that people like Mr Stanfield would escape prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now commercial crime unit detectives are investigating charges of fraud and tax evasion against Mr Stanfield, who could end up like notorious American mobster &quot;Scarface&quot; Al Capone, who was jailed on tax evasion charges during Prohibition in the 1930s after the authorities failed to make other charges stick against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Informed police sources say Mr Stanfield, who is facing drug-dealing charges in connection with a Mandrax bust which involved 87 000 tablets, is believed to have only declared R11-million of his R17-million assets to the Receiver of Revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Stanfield, 42, had not been asked to plead on allegations of dealing in Mandrax in connection with the bust in Beaufort West and is on R500 000 bail. He is expected to appear in court in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Mr Stanfield has made a full declaration of all his assets it will be almost impossible for the the authorities to pursue the &quot;Capone option&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigating officer for the commercial crime unit, Clayton Thomopoulos, said this new investigation was initiated after a complaint of fraud, alternatively contravening section 104 of the Income Tax Act, and a contravention of the Value Added Tax Act, were received from the SARS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are in the process of verifying the allegations against Mr Stanfield and because the matter is sub judice, I cannot furnish more information regarding the investigation,&quot; Sgt Thomopoulos said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the investigation was nearing completion, after which the docket would be sent to Mr Kahn's office for a decision whether to prosecute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Stanfield's lawyer, Reuben Liddell, said he was aware of the investigations, but as the matter had not yet been contested in court, he could not comment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Daimler Benz and Mpumalanga's provincial government is scheduled to enter &quot;highly sensitive&quot; negotiations today (Wednesday) to thrash out the specifics of a R300-million international airport near Hazyview, after Premier Mathews Phosa reached a principled agreement with Daimler Benz executives at a meeting in Germany on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The negotiations, which will take place in South Africa, are aimed at ensuring that Daimler Benz agrees to upgrade Nelspruit's municipal airport in a linked development and also allows for more local participation in the Hazyview scheme.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to ensure that local residents really benefit both through shareholding and in the development itself. Because the airport is 40km from Nelspruit, the existing municipal airport needs to be upgraded to act as a shuttle terminal,&quot; explained Phosa's spokesman, Oupa Pilane.  Pilane refused to comment on what the announcement means for a competing airport development at Primkop near Nelspruit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpumalanga currently has no international airports and has only been granted license to approve one by national aviation authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Primkop is nearer the provincial capital at Nelspruit, Hazyview is regarded as better suited for tourism and fruit exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Hazyview project has been dubbed the Kruger Park International Airport.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - The South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) in Matsulu, near Nelspruit, has called on Mpumalanga premier, Mathews Phosa, to investigate a delay in classroom provision at local schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadtu executive secretary in Matsulu, Lindiwe Sibiya, said the Department of Education had promised in 1994 to build extra classrooms at Tikhontele High School within two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That was three years ago, and now we are faced with a problem where pupils can't attend the required number of periods per week, because of a shortage of classrooms,&quot; Sibiya said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said some pupils no longer wanted to pay the same schools fees as others, as not all pupils were receiving the same number of lessons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the moment, teachers work a full day from 7am to 4pm, giving morning as well as afternoon classes in an attempt to give all Grades their required lesson time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr CG Shube, Nelspruit district manager for education, said on Tuesday he remembered visiting Tikhontele High School three years ago, but could not remember promising to build additional classrooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How can a person promise to build additional classrooms within two weeks when there are department procedures that have to be followed?&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Nkululeko circuit manager, Mrs Hlophe, under whose jurisdiction Tikhontele High School falls, the building of additional structures takes time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First, there's a priority list on which things are prioritised,&quot; Mrs Hlophe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If there is a need to build a structure, a procedure must be followed, and if you don't know the procedure, you must ask,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said building projects had to be checked and re-checked by various offices before being approved, and that it first had to be determined whether there were enough funds to embark on such projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even if there is no money, and you are on the priority list, then you know you will be the first to be considered by the department when funds do become available,&quot; she explained. .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Mpumalanga's finance MEC Jacques Modipane warned the provincial legislature on Tuesday that his R92-million budget for the 1997/98 fiscal year was only enough to pay his staff their salaries and not enough to equip them to actually work effectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insisting that the stringent financial constraints placed on the provincial government by national planners were proving to be counter- productive, Modipane said that he needed at least another R18-million to deliver effective services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We run the risk of creating a banana republic by under-funding our departments and forcing up to five officials to share the same office.  The situation is completely unproductive and inefficient,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modipane also stressed that while his budget for the current fiscal year was theoretically R92-million he actually only had R72-million for core services after &quot;earmarked funds&quot; for centralised services such as a the provincial service commission, a youth commission and religious desk were subtracted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These items total 20,3%, or R18,8-million of my entire budget but gives outsiders the impression that that we receive a far higher allocation than we actually do,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides calling for additional funding for a better and &quot;healthier&quot; working environment for his staff, Modipane also said that the department needed funds for new furniture, computers and &quot;suitable vehicles&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conceding that fully owned Government vehicles were costly because staff tended to abuse them and the province had to cover all maintenance and fuel costs, Modipane said that Mpumalanga was considering boosting its vehicle subsidy scheme to combat these costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When officials own or even partly own the vehicles they have to use for work, they tend to look after them better than if they were state owned and also are obliged to cover the maintenance and some of the fuel expenses themselves,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also confirmed that an internal audit had been launched to investigate the control measures currently being used to manage state vehicles and warned that any officials found guilty of fraud or of abusing the system would be prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amongst the most common abuses were fraudulent transactions on government petrol cards and the supposed theft of government vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This happens when officials report their state vehicle as stolen to the police but that have actually sold the thing illegally,&quot; said Modipane.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - IT was surly Sunday night for Chipolopolo loyalists who travelled to Johannesburg, South Africa, after Zambia was humiliated via a 3-0 drubbing by South Africa's Bafana Bafana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A planned victory party at the Chez Nthemba night club in the sprawling Hillbrow suburb organised by the Zambia-South Africa Friendship Association turned into a rather sad and somewhat despicable spectacle reminiscent of a funeral gathering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scores of disconsolate fans hurdled together, pondering what had gone wrong.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a massacre,&quot; cried Charity Akakandelwa, &quot;I never thought a day would come when Zambian would lose by such a big margin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although some fans took to the dance floor and the laughter levels were high in some cases, the pain was evident every where.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chipolopolo fan club chairman, Elijah Chisanga, was a forlorn figure as he flopped into settee and drowned his sorrows in steins of Castle lager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a disaster,&quot; he lamented, &quot;I will now find it very difficult to mobilize fans to go and cheer our team during away games.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka Province deputy minister Christopher Chawinga who, quite evidently had knocked back one too many, tried in vain to assuage the disconsolate fans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even if we have lost we should rally behind our boys,&quot; Chawinga said, &quot;let's us not blame the coach or the players. The better team carried the day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prominent Lusaka lawyer Mumba Kapumpa, however, had the solution to the unfolding nightmare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let us just enjoy ourselves and open a new chapter,&quot; Kapumpa said as he tossed bones to the sounds of Wenge Musica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some fans, however, it was double tragedy as the bus in which they had travelled in was burgled and their property, including passports, stolen after it was parked metres away from the Chez Nthemba night club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least three people-Maureen Ngombo, David Mulanda and Newton Makukula-confirmed losing their property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have lost everything, including my passport,&quot; Cried Ngombo, &quot;I don't know how I will travel back home.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - AFTER last Sunday's burial of Zambia's hopes of qualifying for the France '98 World Cup finals, all roads now lead to Kabwe to elect leaders who will guide the squad for the African championship in Burkina Faso next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia Tender Board boss Teddy Mulonga who is also super league, Lusaka City Council (LCC) trustee has rejuvenated his attempt to get to Anchor House for the highest office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mulonga's campaign coordinator Fisho Mwale, a patron at LCC is optimistic the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) electoral regulations would not bar Mulonga from the race on June 28.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FAZ electrol regulations bars Mulonga because his nominations papers were signed by Zanaco treasurer Collins Shamutete when the requirement says the club chairman or his secretary are supposed to endorse while the vice-chairman could only sign in the absence of the chairman with an accompanying letter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwale who is also Lusaka City mayor, however, said as far as LCC was concerned Shamutete was also the vice-chairman and was therefore vested with powers by his club to second a candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwale said the fact that he has not received any communication from the association over the impending disqualification of Mulonga goes to show that his nomination was acknowledged and valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have not been informed at all by FAZ that our candidate has been disqualified,&quot; Mwale said in an interview Monday. &quot;Mr. Mulonga is standing in his own right as a man who has been in football for the past 24 years and we shall not demean ourselves by getting involved in smear campaigns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwale who travelled to South Africa to watch the Zambian side go down to Bafana Bafana by 3-0 said the soccer standards in the country would remain mediocre if the leadership is not changed in the coming FAZ elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Zambia national team will remain second best in the region if we don't put the people with a vision of improving the sport,&quot; Mwale said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If FAZ relax the regulations against Mulonga, the contention will be among former FAZ general secretary Herman Mphashi and the incumbent president Micheal who has since accepted blame for Zambia's 'dark Sunday'.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - One of the most popular decisions which came with independence was the discontinuance of the hated Poll Tax and the Pass Book system(Chitupa).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then more than the Poll Tax and Pass Book went with that decision. The only principle and basis for effective financing of local government and one that actually worked efficiently in this country went with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the last constitutional review exercise, some petitioners suggested the re-institution of the &quot;native authority&quot; system. In what they did not state explicitly they were very right.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That system, in retrospect, now appears to have been efficient. But that is not because of its name. It is simply because it encompassed the principle that was destroyed in the &quot;struggle for independence&quot; that of giving local authorities powers to levy and spend revenue from local taxes in the areas where such monies are collected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bulk of the money that the hated District Commissioners (DCs) collected under the Poll Tax system was in fact spent in the districts where it was raised. Very little of it was passed on to Lusaka.  Independence seemed to reverse that. Local authorities now started looking to Lusaka for money and that was the beginning of the end for local government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They lost financial autonomy and this system has succeeded in destroying local government altogether. If it is not reversed there is absolutely no chance that councils will be revived. They will go under and many of them are already in state of effective voluntary liquidation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They need greater access to all revenue raised in their own areas.  Such monies should not all go to Lusaka and only later be recycled in dribs and drabs back to the source. This has killed the councils because the money they get from Lusaka is rarely what they need to put them on an even keel, particularly the bigger ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Council financial problems would not of course be wiped out because some are quite small and there is little activity in their areas. Still, it would allow for some financial autonomy and reduce government subsidies in a number of cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local councils regardless of size have identical problems today.  Throughout the country they are broke and are unable to deliver public services or meet basic financial obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every once in a while the central government releases a few millions to select, more crippled councils. Such money is usually enough only to cover salaries of workers who remain unpaid, many times, for months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These days too they are paid mainly for being on the payroll. They are no longer able to do any real work because of the larger financial problems councils face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has rapidly transformed most councils into nothing more than agencies for the payment of salaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delivery of services, to the communities which are the primary function of councils has ground to halt and the urban environment, in particular, is becoming progressively more unlivable. It now requires only a few more years before all the cities and towns are transformed into shanty compounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a truly frightening scenario and the country is threatened with regression to the dark ages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is time for bold decisions that will serve this vital arm of the government. Burying heads in the sand will not do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Councils must be allowed greater and direct access to at least a reasonable portion of all taxes levied in their areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The present system where the Central government has virtually all the access will only sink the councils further into financial woes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There appears to be no way of escaping giving councils greater access to revenues raised in their areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a system that worked well once before and without something along those lines councils will collapse one by one under the weight of debts and other financial problems.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The concentration of news media organisations in urban and peri-urban areas has created a critical shortage of information among the rural dwellers, said information and broadcasting deputy minister Ernest Mwansa yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwansa, receiving a video van on behalf of Zambia Information Services (ZIS) from United Nations Education and Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), said rural areas are information starved.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Video vans are good alternatives for visual information for rural people who do not have access to television because ZNBC (Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation) fails to reach all the corners of the our country,&quot; Mwansa said. &quot; This has been compounded by the fact that national newspapers have concentrated in urban areas dotted along the line of rail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwansa said the UNESCO donation was appropriate and would help the government in social mobilisation as well as communicating with rural masses on its various programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He assured UNESCO that the van, a Land Rover Discovery, equipped with loudspeakers would be utilised for the benefit of the rural communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And UNESCO country representative, Lusite Deware, said her organisation was happy to contribute in the area of information because it was a crucial sector.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - CitiBank's New York financial institutions vice-president, Maurice Menasche, yesterday advised Commonwealth countries and all African governments to come up with necessary legislation to curb money laundering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Menasche, presenting a lecture on money laundering at the Bank of Zambia yesterday, said money laundering was on the rise in Africa and there was need to put in place relevant laws to fight it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Menasche advised bankers to keep the basic rule of good banking which he said demanded knowledge of clients.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Menasche is on a tour of 15 African countries in CitiBank's efforts to enlighten bankers on the continent on money laundering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bank of Zambia's director of bank supervision, Jonathan Muke, commenting on money laundering in the country in an interview yesterday, said he was hopeful that appropriate legislation would soon be tabled in the House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are happy that the Ministry of Home Affairs has already shown commitment towards ensuring that there is adequate legislation against the activity,&quot; Muke said. &quot;We expect the draft act to be debated when Parliament resumes as this will help address the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although there were no ready figures on money laundering in Zambia, Muke said there was information that it was rife, especially with the rise of drug trafficking activities in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is of great concern that currently we have no legislation against laundering and we only hope that Parliament can quickly enact the law,&quot; Muke said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CitiBank Zambia Limited managing director, Sanjeev Anand, in an interview yesterday, appreciated the commitment shown by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As long as we continue dragging the formulation of the law against money laundering, we will just be paying lip service to the problem,&quot; Anand said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should realise that its has become widely accepted that Zambia has become a transit point for drug trafficking and it is through such activities that laundering is place.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - University of Zambia (UNZA) workers yesterday went on strike and locked up the offices of vice-chancellor Andrew Siwela and other nine top administrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The striking workers appealed to President Frederick Chiluba to immediately remove vice-chancellor Siwela and some of his senior officers for alleged maladministration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workers resolved to stage the strike action during a meeting held yesterday to address their grievances after the non-appearance of a representative from the administration.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They had earlier called for the UNZA council chairman, Dr. Mashekwa Nalumango, to represent the administration to explain why he had failed to dismiss vice chancellor Siwela and some senior members of his administration even after an Auditor General's report which incriminated them in financial irregularities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workers urged President Chiluba to intervene in the matter and take a political decision to dismiss the current management for financial mismanagement and failing to address the workers welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The furious workers also called for the dissolution of the University of Zambia Council for &quot; failing to take remedial measures in the face of rampant irregularities&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the resolutions made at the meeting were to immediately go on strike, lock up the administration officers and block senior management staff from withdrawing money at any of UNZA's 48 bank accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resolutions were made after a lengthy meeting which started at 09:00 hours yesterday and went on until later in the afternoon and was addressed by all the workers' representative bodies - UNZA Lecturers and Researchers Union, UNZA Workers Union and UNZA Professional Staff Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting also resolved that until President Chiluba removed the &quot;rot&quot; no senior management official would be allowed to &quot;get near their offices&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in a letter to President Chiluba, the workers demanded for the immediate removal of the current UNZA administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We recognise that you may have no legal authority in the University Act to intervene in the affairs of the University,&quot; the letter read in part, &quot;but we also note that the financial mismanagement and incompetence of management at UNZA are not issues about legalities but moral standards for the safety of public resources.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They singled out the vice-chancellor, the registrar and the bursar, including their deputies, as having been behind the mismanagement of the institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But UNZA registrar, Michael Tandeo, reacting to the workers' action in a press statement, said administrative staff were not aware of yesterday's meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tandeo charged that the workers' action was a ploy to bar UNZA administrators from presenting their submissions to the ongoing UNZA and Copperbelt University Commission of Inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The events of Tuesday 10th June (yesterday) are clearly part of a plan to prevent management from making its submission on Wednesday June 11 to counteract the many unsubstantiated allegations and distortions that have characterised the submissions from staff of the University of Zambia,&quot; Tandeo's statement read in part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also accused the workers' representatives of divulging confidential information given out by the Auditor General to the University Council on which they were members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is highly irresponsible and unethical of the workers' representatives on the Council to have made the confidential verbal brief by the Auditor General a subject of a public meeting clearly intended to arouse workers emotions and to disrupt the work of the University,&quot; Tandeo said, urging all workers to resume work immediately.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Eastern Province chambers of commerce and industry is to host investment fora next month as part of its efforts to increase awareness of the investment potential of the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairman Mr Idris Ugrader said yesterday, that the fora would be held in the province to afford businessmen there a chance to meet investors and representatives of various organisations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chamber would invite various organisations and potential investors to attend the meetings to give them an opportunity to see for themselves the work the chambers were making to develop the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We realise that there is stiff competition in all areas of the country to attract investments and that is why we want to bring investors here.&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the chambers had come up with four main areas in the province that needed massive investments to reach their full potential and would concentrate on these areas during the fora.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He listed some of the areas as tourism, small scale mining in aquamarine and other precious and semi precious stones which had been underutilised for a long time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other areas that the meeting would look at include agriculture commercial and industrial concerns that had been on the decline for many years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ugrader also said the second Zambia-Malawi trade exposition would take place in Malawi later this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chambers hoped the exposition would become a permanent feature because it would boost trade and exports between businessmen from the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last exposition that had been held in Chipata last year had been a success and had opened opportunities for a number of businessmen from the two countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Chilanga Cement Plc is in dire need of $50m to double its present production capacity of 350,000 tonnes a year in anticipation of high demand for cement by ZCCM and Gecamine of Congo-Kinshasa in the next four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report in the latest issue of Investec Securities obtained by the Times in Lusaka yesterday says whereas at present ZCCM orders 12,000 tonnes of cement a year from Chilanga Cement, the figure is expected to rise to more than 500,000 tonnes within four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demand for cement is further expected to increase with the rehabilitation of the Congolese copper mines in the former Zaire and the report says that Chilanga Cement will fail to meet the demand from the two mining provinces of Zambia and Congo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Chilanga to meet this demand the company would have to increase its capacity by doubling production, a doubtful prospect at present but which might be embarked upon by the year 2002.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, shortages of cement within the Southern African region will become pronounced that even South African companies will find huge new potential markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The case for investing in new capacity is strong, but the funding will be difficult. Chilanga's management estimates that it will cost $50m to double capacity. This does not seem to be too daunting a prospect except that it would have to be done off Chilanga's capital base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At K105 a share, it has a market capitalisation of just $16m. Hence it will have to raise over three times its existing worth to proceed with its expansion,&quot; the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The major shareholder, Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) with 50 per cent, is unlikely to be able to support an equity raising of that size.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The domestic money markets are too small and too short-term to provide more than token amounts of capital. Therefore, Chilanga must look off-shore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To do this there must be a properly marketed international offering while the balance could be sourced off-shore and a combination of a direct investment from a strategic partner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All this would require the cooperation of the CDC. Unfortunately, this may not be forthcoming. The CDC seems to be obsessed with a need to control its investments even when it does so to the detriment of their perfromance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chilanga has already missed the most favourable period to invest because of the CDC's reluctance to countenance its capex plans. We are also aware of at least one key strategic deal that has been vetoed by the CDC,&quot; the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It warns that any further delay would be disastrous as the long-term prospects are astonishing. The nature of the host rock encountered in the copper mines is such that it needs total support to prevent roof falls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most effective solution is cemented backfill. This requires that roughly three tonnes of cement is used to produce one tonne of copper.  It is expected that copper production in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia will reach 500,000 tonnes a year within 10 years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Zambian exports to the US will for the firs t time enjoy duty free treatment, the Office of the US Trade Representative has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest issue of Washington Line, a publication of the American Embassy released in Lusaka on Monday said the U S Generalised Systems of Preferences (GSP) programme had given Zambian goods easy access into the American market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US will allow 1,783 products from the reprieved countries to be imported duty-free.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move would impact on 30 sub-Saharan African states which belong to the world's 38 poorest nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In addition to Zambia and 29 other least developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the other countries newly eligible for the additional trade benefits under the programme include Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Yemen, Cambodia, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Kiribati,&quot; the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though GSP technically expired at the end of last month, the U S administration was seeking a multi-year renewal of the programme, which would provide benefits retroactively to the countries involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The administration is committed to building strong trade partnerships with sub-Saharan Africa's rapidly growing and reforming economies, relationships which will benefit both Africans and Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In an increasingly competitive global economy, the U S cannot afford to neglect a largely untapped market of some 600 million-plus people and the world cannot afford to see a vast region marginalised,&quot; Charlene Barshefsky, U S Trade Representative said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only 0.3 per cent, about $588 million came from the sub-Saharan countries last year, while 64 per cent of total GSP imports come from Asian beneficiaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the competitive need limits provision, an individual beneficiary country can lose duty-free access for a GSP product if the country accounts for more than 50 per cent of total U S imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A country loses the facility also by having exported more than $75 million worth of the product to the U S in 1996.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The 1997 Castrol-Spectra International rally yesterday got a $15,000 boost from the main sponsors, Spectra Oil Corporation, for the the rally's preparations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the donation to Zambia Motor Sport Association (ZMSA) in Lusaka, Spectra managing director Yuyi Lishomwa said the amount was an initial contribution to the rally which revs off next month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lishomwa, whose company distributes Castrol products in Zambia, said ZMSA had demonstrated its ability to promote very well organised events under unfavourable financial conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The donation was an initial of the K30m Castrol, the largest lubricant dealers in the world, pledged last month to be the main sponsors of the Zambia international rally for the next two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZMSA president Lee-Ann Singh received the donation and said she was grateful for the financial support her association was getting. She assured the sponsors all the money would be put to good use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZMSA treasurer Aaron Chungu, who unveiled the K100m budget for the rally, said there was competition in bidding for the sponsorship but they picked Castrol because of its long-term commitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee-Ann said about 25 drivers, most of whom would come from Zambia, were expected in the 1000km rally.It has also attracted drivers from Uganda, South Africa and Kenya.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Nchanga Rangers striker Wedson Nyirenda is at the centre of a 15,000 rand transfer cash wrangle allegedly owed to South African club Hellenic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hellenic are demanding a down payment of the 15,000 rand from Rangers who they also accuse of fielding Nyirenda illegally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wrangle is as a result of Nyirenda's transfer from Hellenic then to Kaiser Chiefs before the player finally found a home at Rangers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyirenda transferred from Hellenic to Kaiser Chiefs for 45,000 rand but Chiefs only made a payment of 30,000 rand, defaulting by 15,000 rand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But since Nyirenda moved to Rangers, Hellenic feel the FAZ Premier Division side should settle the oustanding amount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hellenic secretary Collin Gie has written to FAZ, seeking to recover 15,000 rand from Rangers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his letter to FAZ dated May 25, Gie claimed that despite writing to FAZ, no help has been forthcoming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hellenic have warned that if the matter remained unresolved, they would take legal action to recover the money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rangers secretary Friday Silavwe said in Chingola executive committee was working on the matter and were waiting correspondence from Hellenic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Silavwe said there was a bit of complications in the Nyirenda issue and the club had tried to communicate with the South Africans but had no response from them, reports Melody Mwala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have tried to communicate with Hellenic many times but they have not been responding, making things more complicated,&quot; Said Silavwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyirenda who joined Rangers last season as a guest player has not been playing this season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Silavwe said as far as Rangers were concerned there was nothing wrong with Nyirenda featuring in local games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nyirenda can feature in local games and not international games. He played in the league last season while he has not been featuring in any international games we have played this year,&quot; Silavwe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And FAZ general secretary Julio Chiluba denied having seen any letter from Hellenic and said the matter was supposed to be settled by the two clubs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba said in Lusaka that &quot;I think Hellenic and Rangers are dealing with this matter because we only deal with associations and unless the South African Football Association steps in, that is when we will also get involved.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Civil Servants Union of Zambia (CSUZ) has said the statutory instrument signed last Friday on the delinkage of Health Management Boards (HMB) from Government is anomalous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union has demanded for an immediate meeting with Government to correct the anomalies and warned of industrial unrest if the issue was not resolved quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CSUZ general secretary Japhet Moonde said in a statement jointly signed by national chairman Leonard Hikaumba that it was illegal to transfer workers without them knowing their conditions of service or understanding the nature of the transfer.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Moonde said the statutory instrument signed by Health Minister Katele Kalumba contradicted section 35 of the Laws of Zambia which stated that before a worker could sign a contract of transfer, he should first understand the nature of the transaction and his consent should not be obtained by coercion or undue influence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Government has, however, disregarded all this and in fact workers do not even know the conditions of service under management boards and have not fully understood the nature of the transaction,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the instrument purported that transferred workers would continue drawing salaries from Government until January next year and yet the contracts were expected to be signed by August 1, which meant that the boards were broke and could not sustain themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The instrument did not make any provision for those to be rejected by the boards and was silent on their severance packages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pensions contributions would also be inconsistent with Public Service Pensions Act since contributions would be paid despite signing new contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is because of such glaring anomalies that CSUZ has repeatedly called on government to sit down with all concerned parties and jointly redress these anomalies for the good of the workers as well as for the success of the reform programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is for this reason that we will, after making all necessary consultations with our members, reserve the right to take measures that will serve to speak to Government that enough is enough,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Kalumba announced at the weekend that after the final delinked of management boards on August 1, all workers would have to re-apply for their jobs and sign new contracts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Prisons Fellowship of Zambia (PFZ) has advised newly- pardoned prisoners to exploit their potential through self-employment because the present economic environment does not allow for formal jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vice-chairman of PFZ Mathews Chikwanda told 28 prisoners, who included those pardoned in January, to be self-reliant because seeking employment would prove frustrating and they would be tempted to go back to their old ways.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev Chikwanda said in Ndola this at a seminar organised for ex- prisoners on entrepreneurship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said companies in Zambia were downsizing through retrenchments and employment levels were slowly waning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hard economic times were felt by everyone and he warned former prisoners not to go back to their old ways to make ends meet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PFZ was concerned with the welfare of ex-convicts and wanted to make a change in their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the pardoned prisoners had been incarcerated for a number of years and many felt their time was up, but as far as potential was concerned, it was not too late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the ex-convicts at the seminar said they had undergone tailoring courses at Kabwe's Good Samaritan Centre but they were lacking capital to begin businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said they would not go back to crime as it never paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The course content of the seminar includes introduction to entrepreneurship, developing business ideas, business plans and hope for survival .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 488 prisoners were released under presidential prerogative at the occasion of the last Africa Freedom Day in May, following an earlier 600 in January when President Chiluba opened the first session of the eighth National Assembly.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Bank of Zambia (BOZ) yesterday called on Parliament to quickly pass a law against money laundering to safeguard Zambia from dirty money estimated in billions of dollars circulating globally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BOZ registrar of banks Jonathan Muke said in an interview in Lusaka yesterday that Zambia risked being a major money laundering centre because of her liberalised banking system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Muke was speaking after a money laundering awareness seminar addressed by Citibank International vice-president Maurice Menasche who is on a tour of Zambia and Tanzania.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although there were no statistics to show the magnitude of the laundering problem in Zambia, the lavish life-styles of some citizens were a source of suspicion that they had joined cartels of money launderers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zambia is vulnerable and can be used to launder the money because of her liberalised banking system. Dirty money can easily be brought into the country, cleaned and sent back to the owners,&quot; Mr Muke said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the seminar held at the BOZ in Lusaka, Mr Menasche said Zambia should quickly legislate against money laundering with the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said global statistics indicated that 90 per cent of the money changing hands without paying tax was associated with the scourge of drug trafficking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Zambia had passed a series of laws against drug trafficking, there was need to legislate specifically against crimes like embezzlement, racketeering and illegal gambling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Menasche said: &quot;It is estimated $1 trillion of illicit funds are circulating worldwide and between $400bn and $500bn of this is associated with the drug trade.&quot; The Mafia in the US, Italy, Russia, Bulgaria and Poland as well as the Japanese Yakuza, Asian Triads and South African drug cartels were involved in laundering and needed stiff laws to be checked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said there was need to open up banks to money laundering probes because launderers were also tightly connected to illegal arms trade, terrorism, corruption and political distabilisation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The stand-off between Aero-Zambia and Kenya Airways over flight schedules and landing rights between the two countries has persisted despite Government call for the two airlines to arrange for an equitable sharing of business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aero-Zambia managing director, Youndewossen Mengistu, said in Lusaka yesterday that Kenya Airways has not cooperated with his firm in finding an amicable and lasting solution to their differences.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acting Communication and Transport Minister, Suresh Desai, on Friday said the controversial Kenya Airways flights to Lusaka would remain suspended until the two airlines agreed on an equitable mode of sharing passenger traffic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The two airlines have been asked to make arrangements for equitable sharing of passenger traffic. As long as these arrangements are not in place, the status remains the same,&quot; said Mr Desai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mengistu explained that his firm would be meeting Government to present its case and offer suggestions following Kenya Airways' alleged uncooperative stance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot comment much now lest we pre-empt ourselves. All we can say is that our friends are not being cooperative at all and we shall be informing Government accordingly,&quot; said Mr Mengistu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He denied a June 9 story in the Daily Nation of Kenya that his firm and Kenya Airways have resolved their differences after an understanding reached between their governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These reports are totally untrue as we are already not agreed,&quot; said Mr Mengistu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources told the Times that President Chiluba last week met a Kenyan government delegation led by Transport and Communication minister, Wilson Ayah and ordered the lifting of suspensions of Kenya Airways flights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya Airways is said to be losing more than $25,000 per round trip following the row which was brewed after Kenya's request for further frequencies approved by Communications Deputy Minister Gilbert Mululu.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Zambian political parties which attended a two-day high- level inter-party meeting in Stockholm, Sweden, have resolved to begin dialogue between Government and major opposition parties within 21 days from yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four parties, MMD, UNIP, National Party, and Agenda for Zambia, adopted and signed the agreement known as the Stromsborg statement at the close of the meeting yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement released by the International Institute for Democratic and Electoral Assistance (IDEA) which organised the meeting, the parties agreed to allow the MMD to initiate the first inter-party meeting to establish the agenda and programme of action.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first meeting which would comprise all secretary generals of major political parties would be overseen by a facilitator from IDEA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was agreed that the new dialogue would focus on, among other things, questions about the design of the electoral process and ways of increasing the democratic capacity of institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also in attendance at the round table meeting were representatives of Sweden, Denmark, the European Commission, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Britain, the United States, United Nations Development Fund (UNDP) and the World Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finance Minister Ronald Penza, who led the MMD delegation, said after the agreement was read out, &quot;I am very excited by this event, the beginning of a dialogue to carry forward the process of democratisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a very good development and I appreciate very much the work of IDEA for facilitating this round table.&quot; And UNIP secretary-general Sebastian Zulu echoed Mr Penza's sentiments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am very pleased with the outcome of this unique round table because the interest of the people in Zambia demands that there must be meaningful dialogue,&quot; Mr Zulu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IDEA secretary-general Bengt Save-Soderbergh said the breakthrough in the impasse on dialogue was due to the willingness of all political parties involved to talk to each other and demonstrated a real example of peaceful conflict resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inter-party meetings failed twice last year at the Mulungushi Conference Centre over the issue of chairmanship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And President Chiluba yesterday urged Christians to dedicate more time to prayer if they are to overcome the current intra-denominational wrangles that have dogged churches in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chiluba said in Lusaka that the current intra-denominational rows were a manifestation of Satan's work and Christians would only defeat this by dedicating more time to prayer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was speaking when he officiated at the annual general meeting (AGM) of the Fellowship of Christian Councils in Eastern and Southern Africa (Foccesa) comprising 12 countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the devil had failed in the fight for inter-denominational conflict characterised by the rift between Catholics and protestants in the 1960s and was now busy trying to divide individual churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The intra-denominational conflicts that we are witnessing are the work of the devil and he should not be allowed to succeed. Christians should dedicate more time to prayer,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chiluba said Christians needed to pray for all their preachers and avoid being selective on who should be their pastor because the word of God was universal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged Foccesa members drawn from Angola, Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, Swaziland, Lesotho, Zambia, South Africa and Zimbabwe to venture into conflict resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chiluba said the church had a duty to promote human rights, ecumenism, literacy and other projects that would improve the well-being of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He deplored the high illiteracy levels in the country and called on the church to take up the challenge of liberalisation and venture into management of tertiary education.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Money-laundering for drug-trafficking or other purposes has never been a crime of the poor. It is an exclusive crime of the rich.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the apparently guaranteed advantages that high society criminals enjoy in this business is that law enforcement agencies rarely pounce on them and spark processes that land them in jail. This is how prison has been variously seen as an exclusive penalty for the poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And all the advantages that money-launderers and drug-traffickers enjoy tend to fizzle out in their inability to profit from their illicit gains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The realm of money-laundering is a blood-and-death domain in which there is no joy for all the financial power available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a deceive-and-get-deceived territory in which trust and honesty are simply impossible, in which lying and treachery are the one way of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Personal freedom disappears immediately one enters into the vice, in which the vice-grip of threats and warnings keeps the individual on the run. Laughing all the way to the bank, but tormented all the way to the grave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minors in the field are in easy reach of law enforcement agencies, and even in Zambia the Drug Enforcement Commission (DEC) is yet to display high society influentials the way it has displayed and humiliated lightweights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This situation has tended to show, over and over again, that certain people will always live above the law. Be it in Zambia or elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criminals of sheen may enjoy many advantages as a consequence of this, but even they cannot always escape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where international law enforcement agencies fail, the criminals destroy themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for the cruel ruin they sell to societies worldwide, there is a serious need for our Government to make high class criminals like the largely unknown money-launderers practically - not merely philosophically - liable to prosecution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Five University of Zambia (Unza) council members resigned yesterday as over 2,500 lecturers and general workers went on strike locking up offices of vice chancellor Andrew Siwela and 10 other management officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The employees who gathered at the forum resolved to lock up offices of management officials and immediately go on strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They want Professor Siwela and his vice Professor Jorry Mwenechanya to cease to be signatories to all the 48 Unza bank accounts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will be gathering at the forum at 09:00 hours everyday and only return to work when the officials are removed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The employees removed chains from poles at the forum to use for locking up offices as some suggested they weld the grill doors to all the 11 offices so the officials cannot have access to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University of Zambia Workers Union (UNZAWU) president Darlington Banda and University of Zambia Professionals and Senior Administrative Staff (UNZAPROSA) president Pearson Banda all publicly announced their resignations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNZAWU general secretary Michael Kaluba said Dr Cecilia Shinondo and Mr Yakub Deedat had also resigned. The five officials quit citing the council's inability to discipline the Unza management following glaring financial irregularities unveiled by the Auditor General's report last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The employees resolved they would not return to work until President Chiluba intervened. The three unions have written to Mr Chiluba requesting him to step in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University of Zambia Lecturers and Researchers Union (UNZALARU) vice president Gwala Phiri disclosed at the gathering that one management official awarded himself a K4m loan on Monday. Another senior manager got K7m for his family's holiday at Mosi-O-Tunya Hotel in Livingstone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workers want the following people removed, Prof Mwenechanya, Prof Siwela, Bonaventure Beleshi (purchasing manager), Dominic Chinukwe (purchasing officer), Ian Banda (resident engineer), Fred Zyambo (acting chief internal auditor).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other are Bizeck Phiri (Dean of students), Mafken Tembo (bursar), Ramesh Bhavnani (deputy bursar) Mike Tandeo (registrar) and special assistant to the vice chancellor Mr Peter Mphande.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Unza council chairman Mashekwa Nalumango said it was up to the vice chancellor to accept the resignations of five council members.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in-service student Alex Simumba, 28 failed to substantiate his claims that the bursaries committee had ghost sponsored students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the bursaries committee needed to be investigated and restructured to make it more efficient and responsive to student demands.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when commissioner Dr Wilfred Lombe asked for specific examples, Mr Simumba said he had none but disclosed that students who graduated still appeared on the sponsorship pay roll.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this stage commissioners took time to find out the meaning of the terms. Mr Simumba explained lumpens were drunkards while monks were hard-core students who had nothing to do with women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are they homosexuals?&quot; queried Commissioner Steven Muliokela. &quot;No, they just do not have time for women,&quot; he replied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Tom Kamwendo wondered what the name was for ordinary people and was told &quot; walking timber or logs&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Simumba also suggested that Unzasu accounts be audited to ensure subscriptions were not misused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unza librarian Dr Hudwell Mwacalimba said the vice chancellor and chairman of the council should be appointed by the Head of State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described as unrealistic a senate regulation empowering it to close the university if a stand-off with students exceeded three days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the state of the library at the universities deteriorated after a management decision to drop librarians from the academic salary scale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company (LWSC) customer information manager Martin Liywalii 26, urged Government not to tolerate mismanagement wherever it surfaced otherwise standards of education would continue to decline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in a written submission, Unza senior counsellor Hector Chiboola suggested that the academic calendar commences in September because the current February time-table did not coincide with the Government financial year resulting in delayed funding and payment of student stipend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chiboola said the bursaries committee lacked a clear policy on payment of allowances to students and proposed that supplementary funds be made available at the start of each academic year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Government grants be given to the university directly from the Ministry of Finance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On administration, Mr Chiboola proposed that the council be empowered to discipline the vice chancellor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - The condition of a two-year-old girl who was brutally raped in the Tsumeb district in April is no longer life-threatening after the toddler underwent a specialised operation, a senior medical doctor told The Namibian from Tsumeb last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nangombe Kalukambe is being held in connection with the horror sex attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a telephonic interview yesterday, head of the Tsumeb State Hospital, Dr Mahmoud Eltawik, said the two-year-old victim had been discharged from the Oshakati State Hospital where she had won her struggle for life.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, she will still need to undergo another operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eltawik said that during the rape the little girl's attacker had &quot;ruptured the floor of the vagina resulting in the vagina and the rectum becoming one hole&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors at Oshakati Hospital had performed a colostomy on the two- year-old, in which a tube had been inserted into her colon to prevent &quot;the wound being contaminated&quot; by excreta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The operation also served to prepare the girl for another operation aimed at repairing damaged organs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, Eltawik said, the child was receiving special medication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about her chances of making a full recovery, especially after the next operation, the Medical Superintendent said: &quot;As she is a child we hope she will recover. I hope she will become alright.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police at Tsumeb yesterday named the suspect as Nangombe Kalukambe from Otamatshau village. Although initial reports said the man was 45, the Police yesterday gave his age as 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalukambe is accused of raping the toddler at Omutsewonime village in Oshikoto Region on April 22. Both Otamatshau and Omutsewonime villages are along the Oshivelo Ondangwa main road, west of Oshivelo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police at Oshivelo told The Namibian that Kalukambe was only arrested on May 15 as he had gone into hiding after the rape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Police, Kalukambe has appeared in the Tsumeb Magistrate's Court twice already and is being held in custody until his next hearing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - A world-class luxury train, the Desert Express, which will offer a luxury scenic train journey between Windhoek and Swakopmund, will start operations in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manager Bruno de Comarmond revealed yesterday that the N$21 million project was the first of its kind in southern Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What differentiates this from other existing tourist trains is that Desert Express is not a nostalgic journey to the glorious days of steam travel. It is an ultra-modern train fitted with the latest technology, with the comforts associated with such a product,&quot; he boasted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Comarmond said the Desert Express would provide much-needed foreign currency for the country and put Namibia on the map.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Desert Express has two classes, the Spitzkoppe and the Starview Class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Spitzkoppe class consists of four sleeper coaches, each with six fully air-conditioned, heated cabins. The Starview class has a unique glass-panelled roof which will allow passengers to view the magnificent desert skies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the way to Swakopmund, the train will stop at Okahandja to allow passengers to visit an ostrich farm. There will also be a sunrise excursion to the 'moon valley' landscape in the desert near Swakopmund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The highlight on the eastbound journey from Swakopmund will be a visit to the Spitzkoppe mountains for a tour of the San paintings and an opportunity to experience Namibia's magnificent sunsets against the Spitzkoppe mountains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The luxury train will depart from Windhoek in the early afternoon and arrives at the coastal town at 10h00 the next day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Desert Express was designed by a leading European engineer, Dr Karl Dieter Bodack and 50 jobs for Namibians were created during the building of the train. After its completion, 25 train attendants will be employed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Desert Express will contribute greatly to promoting Namibia as an attractive tourist destination,&quot; said De Comarmond.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - The DTA of Namibia has condemned a third term for President Sam Nujoma, saying that he did not exhibit the qualities expected from a 'father of the nation'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement yesterday, DTA president Mishake Muyongo said that Nujoma's supporters maintained that he should serve another term because he was the father of the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As father of the nation he should set an example to his people regarding the eradication of poverty that he is constantly preaching.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muyongo said that the eradication of poverty was not high on the President's list of priorities, taking into account the N$4,8 million spent on new vehicles for Nujoma's motorcade, as well as the approximately N$200 million which will be spent on his new jet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The DTA wishes to point out that for the price of these travelling toys for Mr Nujoma, some 4 000 sub-economic houses could be built for the homeless; or some 20 fully equipped and staffed clinics for the rural population; or hundreds of classrooms; or every learner could have his own set of schoolbooks; or teachers, nurses and police staff could receive the salary increases that have been denied them. The list of needs of the Namibian people is endless when measured against the waste of taxpayers' money on such uncalled-for luxuries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accusing the Swapo government of showing signs of following in the footsteps of other African governments who wasted their resources, Muyongo asked whether Nujoma wanted to be remembered in history for the same spendthrift habits as Mobutu Sese Seko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The DTA of Namibia wishes to urge the people of Namibia not to keep quiet about the things they see going wrong, the way the people of Zaire did. They should speak out now against this waste of money that could be spent on far more urgent things that will benefit thousands instead of only one person,&quot; he concluded.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - Namibia Breweries Limited achieved excellent results for the financial year which ended on January 31, with turnover rising by 31,9 per cent from N$205,2 million to N$270,7 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Operating income increased from N$34,9 million to N$40 million while total financing costs decreased by 20,6 per cent, mainly due to the repayment of short term borrowings. The net income attributable to shareholders increased by 28,5 per cent to N$34,7 million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The beer division again contributed the major portion of operating income. Turnover for this division increased by 27,3 per cent to N$207,6 million, while volume in hectolitre terms showed a 17 per cent increase, from 628 000 to 735 000 hectolitres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the softdrink division, turnover went up by 28,2 per cent to N$39,6 million while the schnapps division also showed significant growth with an increase in turnover of 111 per cent to N$5,5 million, mainly as a result of substantial volume increases in the South African market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tabling the company's annual report last week, Namibia Breweries' chairman Werner List said the focus would continue to be on export markets with long term growth potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that more and more beer drinkers in South Africa were beginning to appreciate the taste of pure Namibian beer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our brands continue to achieve growth far above budgeted forecasts, especially so in the premium market where the support of the discerning beer drinker is on the increase,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">List added that other countries in the subregion had all been identified as prime potential export markets. Improvements in the distribution network of the respective markets, as well as regionalised promotions had contributed to a sales volume increase of 28,2 per cent in the company's export performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to the domestic market, List said that all sales regions in Namibia had reported solid volume growth. The company's position as market leader in Namibia has been further consolidated, while performance in the domestic beer market had exceeded sales volumes for the previous year by 6,3 per cent. This had occurred despite a negative macro-economic environment, resulting from adverse climatic conditions, low fish stocks, the ongoing high interest rates and the persistent deterioration of the Namibian dollar in relation to other foreign currencies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - Nico Tromp, outgoing chairman of the Namibia Stock Exchange, called on the private sector to seize opportunities to create economic growth and more jobs, when he addressed the fifth Annual General Meeting of the NSE last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Namibia's economic growth was forecast at over three per cent this year and possibly even higher in 1998. A bumper harvest should boost the agronomic sector, while ocean conditions and fish stocks appeared to be improving.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the annual report for the year to February 1997, Tromp said that diamond production should increase while prices remained healthy. Other mining projects were also being discussed, including one of the biggest copper mines in southern Africa, on which a final decision could be expected soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Minney, NSE's general manager outlined the figures of five years of dramatic growth in the annual report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The most significant development of the last year has been the dramatic growth of the NSE local market, made up of the shares of companies which are owned in Namibia or have the majority of their operations here,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Namibia Breweries and CIC, which were both listed in May 1996, have boosted local liquidity. The 1997 International Finance Corporation handbook puts NSE liquidity at 11.5 per cent, which was higher than the Johannesburg and Zimbabwean stock exchanges. The NSE local index was the 19th best in the world for US$ investors in 1996, after climbing 74 per cent for local investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Total NSE income was up 71 per cent to N$1.08 million, while total expenditure went up by 32 per cent to N$488 884. This left a net surplus of N$480 349 after N$109 985 was transferred to the NSE guarantee fund.  Some of the surplus and other reserves were budgeted for a new computer system, on which project specification work was in progress. This would speed trading, cut risks and move the market towards scripless settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transfer Secretaries (Pty) Ltd, an NSE subsidiary, also saw big increases in business. Overall the NSE had increased staff numbers and capacity and would continue the process as trading volumes were expected to soar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An active secondary market in government debt and legal changes to allow limited liability corporate membership were in the pipeline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Finance Minister Nangoloh Mbumba, the time was right for new developments in the financial markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The speech was delivered on his behalf by Helmut Angula to an appreciative audience of 230, including leaders of business and finance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry had launched an invitation for proposals on consolidating existing government debt. It planned to combine issues, extend maturities and take other steps to build secondary trading. The primary market for gilts was already working well and a money market was also active in Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The broking membership would be transformed if planned amendments to the Stock Exchanges Control Act were passed early next year. These would allow limited liability corporate stockbroking firms, including banks and foreign-owned stockbrokers. Capital requirements would be raised.  Dual-capacity trading may be considered later for brokers who want to be both agent and principal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbumba also called for discussion on widening share ownership, &quot;both as a way to increase savings to be put into risk capital and to prepare for later privatisation exercises.&quot; He praised a joint government- private sector initiative called &quot;Emerge 2001&quot; to develop Namibia's financial markets over five years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - Namibian officials have launched a top-level probe into the 'negative impact' of an electrified fence Botswana is building along the Namibia-Botswana border at the southern side of the West Caprivi Game Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the fence is not yet complete, it is already sparking controversy and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is resulting in Namibia losing valuable game. It is also disrupting the migratory routes of the elephant population in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Added to this, well-placed sources said the 'electric wall' was set to disrupt the lifestyle of the Kxoe people in the area.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The N$4,8 million fence is ostensibly being built to prevent the cross-border &quot;spread&quot; of foot and mouth and lung sickness disease among cattle following a devastating outbreak of lung sickness disease in Botswana in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition to the project has also emerged in Botswana because there has been no environmental impact assessment study, or consultation with potentially affected communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Namibia initially gave conditional support for the erection of the 'electric wall' as long as it did not interfere with the migratory routes of elephants or with the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But now the Caprivi border fence plan is raising concerned eyebrows in conservation, community, tourism and other circles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior ranger stationed in the Bagani area in Caprivi said that in April alone three giraffes and an elephant died while struggling to free themselves after becoming trapped in the fence. The animals were following their natural migration path along the game corridor from Namibia to Botswana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the animals reportedly died on the Namibian side of the border, a group of Batswana apparently sneaked into the country and carted away the elephant and giraffe carcasses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fence, which will only be electrified once it is fully completed, will stretch from the area around the Mahango game reserve to the Kwando river in the Caprivi. Work on the fence started in December and was initially due to have been completed by the end of this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the face of mounting game losses, Namibian authorities have launched a probe to ascertain the seriousness of the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our office in the Caprivi is looking into the seriousness of the situation so that appropriate procedures will follow between the two governments,&quot; a senior Ministry of Environment and Tourism spokesperson, Sackey Namugongo, told The Namibian yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are discussing the losses incurred in our game and our Ministry is investigating the situation,&quot; he revealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Namugongo said the probe, being carried out by Ministry officials, was focusing on the impact of the fence on game migration and was aimed at rectifying the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that although his office did not yet have exact statistics on the number of game losses being caused by the fence, the matter had become worrying enough to be brought to his Ministry's attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The area being fenced is a free movement area or a corridor for the immigration of elephants, buffaloes, lions and other animals migrating between Angola, Namibia, Zambia and Botswana,&quot; he observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unconfirmed reports have also surfaced that portions of the uncompleted fence have already been destroyed by elephants as they move to and from Botswana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before Botswana started putting up the electric barrier, authorities from the line ministries in that country consulted Namibia's Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Rural Development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Personal assistant to the Minister of Agriculture, Samuel Goagoseb, said the Ministry had initially given Botswana a green light on the move, but only on condition that &quot;migratory routes for elephants should be left open&quot; and that the fence should not interfere with the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry had also agreed to the project because the fence is apparently not being erected on the international boundary separating the neighbouring states, but on the Botswanan side of the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agriculture, Water and Rural Development was consulted because the issue pivoted around controlling the spread of livestock diseases, which falls under their jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initial issues pertaining to environment were apparently ironed out with the Environment and Tourism Ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contacted for comment yesterday, Botswana's High Commissioner to Namibia, Edward Matenge, said the matter had not been brought to the attention of the Botswana Mission in Windhoek.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Matenge added, the Namibian authorities had raised the issue with his country's government. But, he said: &quot;I don't want to go further than that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report in the Okavango Observer earlier this year quoted Botswana's Agriculture Minister, Roy Blackbeard, as saying the fence was the only &quot;practical step&quot; that could be taken to prevent the free movement of cattle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, conservation organisations in Namibia's eastern neighbour believe there are alternatives as well as ways of making fences &quot;wildlife friendly&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Japan, which is willing to buy ivory from the three Southern African nations pressing for the removing of the elephant from the list of endangered species, does not have enough controls in place to check illegal trade, the leading environmental pressure group, Greenpeace, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its position paper to the on-going conference on the Convention in International Trade on Endangered Species, Greenpeace said it supported the findings of the panel of experts on the African elephant, set up by the convention, that downlisting could trigger poaching activities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe, which together have 155,000 elephants, want to animal downlisted from Appendix I to Appendix II, which will allow limited and controlled trade in ivory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Greenpeace said the Japanese market was insufficiently controlled to stop illegal ivory trade while control in the three nations pushing for downlisting seemed to be problematic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the event of a partial relaxation of the international trade ban on ivory and other elephant products, poaching is likely to restart,&quot; It said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent reports of up to 280 elephants killed in Cameroon at the end of 1996, it said, say poachers claimed that they had killed the elephants assuming that trade in ivory would become legal in 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a population of 66,000 against a carrying capacity of 35,000 elephants, Zimbabwe says it has become increasingly difficult to manage in a sustainable manner, the ever increasing elephant population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the question of controls in Japan, Zimbabwe says it is prepared to have two ports established - one in Harare and the other in Japan - with officials and witnesses appointed to accompany the ivory until it reaches its final destination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CAPE TOWN, South Africa (PANA) - South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said Thursday developed countries would likely be unable to sustain their long-term stability if they failed to help reduce poverty in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbeki was speaking at the global ceremony to launch the United Nations Development Programme Human Development 1997 report. The ceremony was held simultaneously with that in Bonn, Germany via satellite link.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said measures to eradicate or reduce poverty should involve the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A people-centered society is important,&quot; he said. &quot;We have to talk to people who are negatively impacted by policies we introduce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbeki later told a news conference that if the developed world was serious about helping develop Africa, then they should forgive debts owed by these countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they don't it will be difficult to talk of progress in Africa,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa, he said, could help by making itself attractive to foreign investment so as to manage its high budget deficit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the U.N. agency, Africa's debt stands at 215 billion U.S. dollars, up from 55 billion dollars in 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission chairman, Bishop Desmond Tutu, said in a live satellite message to Bonn and Cape Town that if it were possible to end apartheid in South Africa, it should also be possible to eradicate poverty in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some years ago, some people thought it was a dream to get rid of apartheid,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poverty would disappear, he said, if governments spent less on arms and spent more on gender development, social, economic and environmental issues and if there was a more equitable economic order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My call to you who helped to end apartheid is let's join to end the scourge of poverty,&quot; Tutu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.N. Development Programme's report, which was launched throughout the world, could be used by governments to formulate policies aimed at reducing poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency said only a fraction of the global income was needed to eradicate poverty the world over. It said it would cost about 80 billion dollars to provide universal access to basic social services to alleviate poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The additional cost of achieving basic social services for all in developing countries, it said, was about 40 billion U.S. dollars a year over the next 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said that this sum was less than 0.2 percent of the world income of 25 trillion dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another 40 billion dollars is required if the gap between the annual income of poor people and the minimum income which would lift them from poverty is to be closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Better collection, publication and analysis of statistics showing how countries are reducing poverty will be important for maintaining momentum,&quot; the agency said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The president of the Zimbabwe Economic Society, Kenias Mafukidze, has said the country's macro-economic stability is under renewed threats from inflation which has risen by more than 60 percent from 13.9 percent in November 1996 to 22.4 percent in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is disturbing about this rate is that there are no signs that the amount is going to come down,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, the rate is more than likely to rise above the April peg in subsequent months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the June issue of Megabuck, Mafukidze said the knock-on effects of the recent fuel price hike will definitely result in a spate of price increases in other items causing cost-push inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe's fuel prices went up in May by between 12 percent and 24 percent despite a background of reduced oil prices from 247.50 Zimdollars (22.50 U.S. dollars) at the beginning of the year to 203.50 Zimdollars(18.50 U.S. dollars) in recent months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mafukidze said the expected increase in the budget deficit would have a serious inflationary impacts as it would have to be funded from domestic sources following the suspension of funds by the International Monetary Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The budget deficit was set to rise to about 11 percent of GDP as opposed to the initial target of 8.5 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it is not contained this rise in inflation figures will have devastating ramifications on the marketplace,&quot; Mafukidze said. &quot;The impact of the unforeseen rate increases is likely to be met with confusion, alarm and uncertainty by the market.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Belgium has requested President Laurent Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo to actively seek for a prompt solution to the refugee problem in his country in conjuction with the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call was made in Lusaka on Thursday by the Belgian ambassador to Zambia, Leopold Carrewyn, when he presented letters of credence to President Frederick Chiluba.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that Kabila should also shed full light on the humanitarian situation in eastern congo which is plagued with the problem of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carrewyn said that his government is in favour of a broad-based transitional government in Congo-Kinshasa, with a prospect of free and fair elections within a reasonable time-span.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our own position towards the new Democratic Republic of Congo, and President Kabila is, as you know, positive and constructive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Burundi, the Belgian diplomat regretted that since the military take-over by Maj. Pierre Buyoya, the situation in that country has remained worrisome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carrewyn said that Brussels welcomes ongoing Zambian efforts to restore legitimacy in that country. Zambia is among East and Central african states which imposed sanctions on Burundi after Maj. Buyoya's military coup on July 25, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The envoy said his government, as well as in the framework of the European Union continue to be ready to play an active supporting role in preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welcoming the new ambassador, Chiluba assured Belgium of his country's intention to promote cooperation and regional integration. He said, however, that it was not possible to have regional trade when there is instability in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unless there is stability in the region, there is nothing much we can talk about in terms of trade. Zambia remains committed to the idea of regional integration,&quot; Chiluba said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK, United Nations (PANA) - The United Nations Secretary- General, Kofi Annan has called on the parties to the current fighting in Brazzaville to cease hostilities and begin negotiations to settle their differences immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Secretary-General is increasingly concerned about the deteriorating situation in Congo, Brazzaville, and the rising human toll of this conflict,&quot; UN spokesman Fred Eckhard said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He welcomes president Omar Bongo's readiness to mediate, and appeals to other leaders in the region with influence on the parties to assist in any way they can,&quot; Eckhard said. The UN spokesman said that the Secretary-General had requested his special representative to the Great Lakes region, Mohamed Sahnoun, to support the peace effort in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of people have been killed in Brazzaville since fighting broke out last week between government forces and a private militia loyal to a former Congolese military leader, Gen. Denis Sassou-Nguesso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fighting started when President Pascal Lissouba, fearing a possible disruption of the country's forthcoming presidential elections, sent government troops to disarm the 5,000-strong &quot;Cobra&quot; militia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, Annan briefed the Security Council on the situation in the country, and other African hot spots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are worried it (fighting in Brazzaville) could spread to central Africa,&quot; he said after the briefing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) says although poverty had begun to show signs of decline, its rise is caused by new global pressures such as AIDS, conflicts, retarded or stagnant economic growths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its 1997 Human Development Report, the UNDP said it was possible to eradicate poverty in the first decades of the 21st century if countries stuck to their promise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This may seem an extraordinary ambition, but it is well within our grasp,&quot; says the report.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said almost all countries committed themselves to eradicating poverty by the 21st century at the World Summit for Social Development held in Denmark in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At present, a quarter of the world's people remained in severe poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a global economy of USD 25 trillion this is a scandal reflecting shameful inequalities and inexcusable failures of national and international policy,&quot; noted the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said that Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest proportion of people in - and the fastest growth in - human poverty. Children are most vulnerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Half a million women worldwide also die each year in child birth - at rates 10 to 100 times higher than those in industrialised countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also indicates that a growing number of elderly people live their twilight years in poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report identifies some of the solutions to poverty as empowering economically both women and men, gender equality, globalisation, political and international support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNDP has been producing an annual report on human development since 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reports are destined for policy makers, private organisations, academics, civil society and the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was with this in mind that the UNDP organised a two-day workshop in Cape Town, South Africa, from Thursday to discuss issues raised in the report focusing on African development experiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overall objective of the workshop is to raise the awareness of participants on the critical issues to be tackled in eradicating poverty and the policy implications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants include high level government officials, non- governmental organisations, academics, parliamentarians, journalists, representatives of African institutions and UNDP officials from 19 African countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Expelled Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) Nalolo member of parliament Kasukwa Mutukwa has been accused of betraying the party by flirting with State House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mutukwa has dismissed the allegations as &quot;madness&quot; and &quot;hallucinations&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZDC deputy national secretary Azwell Banda, in an interview yesterday, said his party was aware of the activities of Mutukwa, expelled party treasurer Dante Saunders and Susan Jere's alleged links to the ruling MMD through defence minister Ben Mwila.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's important to make it clear that no single member of ZDC executive can flirt with the MMD and escape unnoticed,&quot; Banda said, insisting he was also speaking as a member of the steering committee.  &quot;We have the capacity to know whatever Chiluba is doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banda further claimed that the MMD legal machinery has been empowered to seek ways of saving Mutukwa's parliamentary seat without going through a by-election. He also claimed President Frederick Chiluba was using Nakatindi Wina &quot;to bring Mutukwa into the MMD&quot; and he has been promised a big post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutukwa, in an interview last night, said Banda's allegations did not have any foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's madness. I'm sorry to use such words,&quot; Mutukwa said in an interview last night. &quot;They better be serious. I don't want to be drawn in accusations and counter-accusations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutukwa said he last met President Chiluba in 1992 when he was head of the Eastern and Southern African Management Institute (ESAMI) in Arusha and was not in the delegation which met the president before the November 18 elections last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when asked about Mutukwa's position, ZDC president Dean Mung'omba said he was aware that the Nalolo member of parliament was meeting President Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mung'omba said, according to information before the steering committee, matters Mutukwa discussed with President Chiluba bordered on &quot;betrayal of ZDC&quot;. He said the expelled vice-president for international relations &quot;saw Chiluba to dissociate himself from the petition&quot; currently before the Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All those are hallucinations,&quot; Mutukwa said last night.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The government was party to the management problems the University of Zambia (UNZA) was facing, charged UNZA vice-chancellor Professor Andrew Siwela yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Siwela, submitting to the ongoing commission of inquiry on operations of University of Zambia and the Copperbelt University appointed by President Frederick Chiluba, accused the government of not following communications channels and has contributed to the strained relations between management and workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Siwela further charged that government ministries had been releasing &quot;classified&quot; information intended for the UNZA administration to union officials at the institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My strong appeal and recommendation is that the ministries should respect channels of communication.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently information intended for the management is being given to individuals frequenting ministry corridors,&quot; Professor Siwela said yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Siwela cited a recent incident when the Ministry of Education released information that workers salary arrears would be paid out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While management was trying to work out the modalities for the payment even before the funds were made available, several copies about the payment were given to the union leaders which has now led to the strike at the campus,&quot; Professor Siwela said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the commission that this situation had rendered the administration redundant as information had been going directly to the workers without the knowledge of management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you are a political appointee you can absorb it but its not possible if you have been selected from a group to run an institution,&quot; Professor Siwela said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And UNZA bursar, Mafukeni Tembo, in his submission defended the move taken to operate 38 bank accounts saying that the accounts serviced different wings of the institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tembo said that among the 38 accounts, UNZA had 14 central accounts for direct use by the campus, 11 accounts for the various schools at the university, six for projects usually funded by donors, and three hard currency accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am afraid we have to be bold on this matter. It is surprising that people I work with can come and say such things to the commission. I cannot believe there is any institution with a K14.5 billion allocation that can operate only one account,&quot; Tembo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called on the commission to send independent auditors to the university to investigate the state of the accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Professor Siwela yesterday accused some petitioners in the on- going commission of inquiry of wanting to discredit his reputation by making false submissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He accused a petitioner who had earlier claimed that the UNZA was running without stationery had lied and further invited the commission to inspect the university's store room to prove his claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wish to draw your attention to the grade three lecturer who told this August house a truck carrying stationery and training aids bought from South Africa had not arrived and that the university had been operating without basic stationery including chalk,&quot; Professor Siwela said. &quot;I wish to state that the petitioner told a lie and that is tantamount to perjury.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Siwela charged that several petitioners had intentions of putting his reputation into disrepute. He was referring to the recent submissions that Professor Siwela's administration had mismanaged and plundered the university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am being called a thief and being blasted left, right and centre and from the recent action at the university it is easy to see that most of the petitioners want to destroy my personal reputation,&quot; Professor Siwela said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And UNZA administrators after giving their submissions, were yesterday taken to task on why they had not included the librarian in management as per the institution's Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the librarian's submission, he had been down-graded to the level of senior lecturer instead of that of professor as was the case in other universities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNZA deputy vice-chancellor, Professor Jorry Mwenechanya, said that the librarian was still in level of management but had been excluded from the daily management of the institution as he was not directly involved with the role. Professor Mwenechanya could not, however, fully explain why the decision was taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Professor Siwela insisted that the librarian had only complained about his position because he had not been receiving some of the &quot;fringe benefits&quot; that management staff were getting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, striking UNZA workers have refused to return to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Siwela, in an interview yesterday, said the workers had stood their ground on not going back to work and called for government's intervention in the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have refused to go back to work and are still denying us access to our offices,&quot; Professor Siwela said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We just have to wait until state intervenes to show them that anarchy cannot prevail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And UNZA Lectures and Researchers Union chairman, Mark Mulenga, yesterday denied that their move to stage a strike was not aimed at stopping the university administration from giving their submissions in the on-going inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There has been no evidence of violence in our protest. And we wish to deny the statement made by the registrar that we were trying to stop them from giving their submissions,&quot; Mulenga said. &quot;In fact we actually advised them strongly to go and give their submissions.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - JUST for that moment when South Africa's Bafana Bafana were thundering goals into our nest, I for a while started dying to have been a South African.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patriotic I am. And if I was to classify my self (although I hate doing that because I do not see sense in the classes our constitution has introduced), I am a first degree Zambian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But let us face the truth. South Africans believe they are not losers and they have reaped just exactly that.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I could feel my innerself trying to praise South Africa as minute after minute was consumed without our players coming into the game. When the first thunderbolt was sent past Davies Phiri, I immediately brushed it as the biggest mistake South Africa had committed because they had heightened Zambia's anger. Seeing the second, I felt my intestines quacking. And with the third goal - I declared Zambia had been embarrassed beyond redemption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previously, I used to go to town with our soccer rating as that was the only pride I could boast of among other nationals. At least in sport, soccer was the identifying factor of Zambia. What can boast about now? The economy? Political leadership? Democracy? No way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africans are champions, they also can boast about their economy and the leadership of President Nelson Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think we had all the designs of going to lose. Our football association was in shambles coupled with ill preparedness of our players. Yes, we may have good players indeed but they seemed to have easily accepted defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I for one would like to lump my blame on the players and the Football Association of Zambia. Not the coaching staff and I would echo the stance taken by people that coach George Mungwa should be spared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we saw last Sunday, was Zambian soccer at its lowest. But what is going to remain up in Zambia? Soccer has been brought down. Politics have gone to the dogs. The Presidency has sunk lower. The integrity of the judiciary is in tatters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I do not dismiss superstitions but I would like to dismiss claims made by people that the Bafana Bafana were playing with the blessing of the sangomas. I think that is wishful thinking to use as an apology for our loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Zambia is a Christian nation and God should have been on our side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For once let us face reality, the South Africans did not win by fluke. When they lifted the African Cup, I was one of the people who wishfully said, had Zambia met South Africa and not Tunisia in the semi- finals - we would have definitely trounced the Bafana Bafana to earn a place in the finals. With all my patriotism, I think South Africa's win was not a fluke and they might prove to be better ambassadors of Africa than we would have been.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are incapable of preparing for a crucial game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One thing Zambia should not forget is that we owe the players who perished off the coast of Gabon a lot and one thing that can pay off is releasing the Gabon Report. At least for the sake of the families involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot has been played down, no wonder this misfortune Zambia is facing. We should not accuse the South African sangomas of sacrificing chickens to earn Zambia's defeat. Probably the biggest enemy we have embraced is the non-release of the Gabon report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think the whole plain truth we should know is that even if we change the executive in the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) we will not achieve anything to speak home about. We will always say we have to sit down and muse. But for how long when countries we used to look at as football minnows are today fattening their sport curriculum vitae.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - FOOTBALL Association of Zambia (FAZ) treasurer Musa Kasonka Jr. has appealed to the government to invest heavily in soccer if the standards in the country have to improve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kasonka made the appeal on his arrival from South Africa on Monday where the Zambian side was humiliated by 3-0 bash in the World Cup qualifier at First National bank stadium.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kasonka who attributed the loss to the ill preparedness of the team compared to the South African counterparts said it was time to talk less and implement programmes that will boost sport in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zambia has to invest heavily in the technical aspect of soccer and I think we should talk less and become action oriented,&quot; said Kasonka.  &quot;Our friends in South Africa have already started preparing the Under-23 team for the Olympics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia only played two international preparatory games prior to last Sunday's World Cup qualifier match in Johannesburg which Kasonka said was not enough to expect a victory over the Bafana Bafana who played their preparatory games in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a soccer fan Mumba Kapumpa still clad in the Zambian colours on arrival at the International Airport advised the country to bury the humiliation and concentrate on the African championship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kapumpa also challenged the soccer administrators to rise to the occasion and prove their worth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have talent but we need to harness it and FAZ should have people with a vision of improving the sport,&quot; said Kapumpa. &quot;As long as FAZ remains in the doldrums we won't get anywhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another fan Felix Khani who heaped the blame on the soccer administrators said that the country was not short of people who can run FAZ effectively.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - TWENTY-five motor rally drivers are expected to rev in this year's Castrol-Spectra Zambia International Motor Rally on July 4, Lusaka Motor Club president Aaron Chungu has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chungu said three international drivers from Zimbabwe have already confirmed their participation while some drivers from Kenya, South Africa and Namibia are yet to confirm their participation in the K100 million rich event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Three international drivers are definitely coming from Zimbabwe and more are expected from South Africa, Kenya and Namibia,&quot; Chungu said in an interview after launching a promotional programme of the rally at the Zambia National Broadcasting Cooperation studios Tuesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chungu also disclosed that the FIA, World's Motor Rally governing body has already ratified Andy Nagi of Kenya as the clerk of the course whose route will be announced later while Italian, Bruno Moretti will be an observer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andy was the Course Clerk in the international Equator Rally, a major event in Kenya which was last won by Zambian Guru, Satwant Singh who is also expected to lead this year's event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Spectra Oils Managing Director, the co-sponsors of the rally, Yuyi Lishomwa presented a cheque of US$15,000 to the Zambia Motor Sport Association (ZMSA) president Lee-Ann Singh to assist with the preparations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lishomwa said that it was Castrol's, the lubricant dealers tradition to sponsor sports World over and more importantly to the deserving disciplines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We selected motor sport not only as a tradition but because we wanted to associate ourselves with an organisation which is accountable and run its affairs properly,&quot; said Lishomwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lee-Ann Singh said the focus will be on Zambia because they are the current holder of the annual biggest event title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a premier competition because it is the biggest sporting event in the country,&quot; Singh said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chungu said the donation of US$15,000 by Spectra of the K30 million pledge the company made last month was a boost to the preparation of the event that will see the cream of the Zambian drivers enter the two days event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We thank Mr.Yuyi for taking up this challenge because it is through this that a sport can become a reality,&quot; Chungu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chungu said the Association will make up for the shortfall of K70 million and was very optimistic that the target will be met before the flagging off day on July 4, at Pamodzi Hotel.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most indicative time would have been during the run up to last year's elections. That in fact is when the problem of lack of dialogue started and also manifested itself fully.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is at that time when the MMD revealed and stood by its true colours. Even the most sanguine donors counted for nothing and were easily shouted down and denigrated.  by not acting then, the Swedish friends of Zambia lost a real opportunity to test their true worth in the eyes of the MMD government and it is necessary to know that sort of dimension when dealing with an apparently opportunist regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is nothing fundamentally wrong with the Stockholm meeting except that it comes at a time when the Zambian government is really desperate and will do anything that will enhance chances of a resumption of aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The repercussions of its misguided arrogance in the period before the elections are only now beginning to register. But it gotten what it wanted and now it can negotiate 'nothings&quot; as its hold on power will not be affected in any meaningful way through such talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MMD cannot possibly turn down an opportunity like the Swedes offered even for appearances sake only.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resumption of Swedish balance of payments support is a sure fire incentive and the government will do anything to have it resumed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting therefore does not represent the true attitude of the MMD to either the Swedish initiative or the talks themselves. It merely suits its designs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is however a sad commentary, on particularly the government of Zambia, and a reflection of its utter desperation that it can only act because of the possibility of aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issues involved in inter-party dialogue transcend hard self- interest considerations. They relate above all to the well being of the country as a whole. True Zambian patriots should require no plodding nor the dangling of balance of payments support before they can act on a matter of that nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sweden does not owe Zambia a living at all. Why then should it take a foreign country for Zambians to act in their own interest? It is a profoundly troubling question.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - AN Election Commission provisional results document revealed yesterday in the Supreme Court that one constituency had more than 2,000 extra voters from the registered number of voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential election petition witness number 93, Dr. Steven Moyo, read out figures from the documents for Mansa Constituency which showed that the constituency had more people than were registered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was during the continued hearing of the presidential election petition in which five opposition parties are contesting the candidature and re-election of President Frederick Chiluba.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Moyo said another Elections Commission document that showed the registered total number of people in each constituency showed that Mansa had 10,145 voters but after voting, it emerged that Mansa had about 12,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He tabulated the votes as follows: President Chiluba (MMD) - 10,433, Chakomboka Chama (MDP) - 188, Lewanika Mbikusita-Akashambatwa (AZ) - 69, Mulemba Humphrey (NP) - 146, Mung'omba Dean (ZDC) - 975, rejected ballot papers 511. This totals 12, 322, showing a difference of 2,177 votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moyo also gave other examples of elections results having been changed from an earlier document he claims came from the Elections Office to the official provisional results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He gave various examples, amongst which was Constituency number 87 Nakonde. It shows that President Chiluba got 5,896 from an earlier document but from the official provisional results he got 5, 894, two votes less and in Isoka East President Chiluba got 5,949 in the earlier result but reduced to 2,757 in the official results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This difference is also reflected in all the other presidential candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Moyo finished his evidence, President Chiluba's lawyers, minister at State House Eric Silwamba and legal affairs minister Vincent Malambo, applied for an adjournment to today in the afternoon to enable them meticulously study all the documents that Dr. Moyo had referred to so that they would be able to adequately deal with him in cross- examination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The application was granted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mululu, officially opening the first Aviation Seminar organised by the National Airports Corporation Limited (NACL) at Lusaka's Pamodzi Hotel yesterday, said Zambia should not lag behind in aviation technology especially on air control management.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transport and communications deputy minister told seminar participants from the Zambia Air Force, Zambia Express, Aero Zambia and other private airlines that the relevance and importance of aviation towards socio-economic development of any country was unquestionable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theme of the seminar is Aviation Development in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Aviation in Zambia plays a pivotal role in our economic development particularly that our country is a landlocked country with a vast geographical area,&quot; Mululu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mululu said the aviation industry, being the fastest mode of transportation today, was also very instrumental in the conducting of world business such as tourism and general transportation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Opposition UNIP president Kenneth Kaunda and Liberal Progressive Font (LPF) chairman Rodger Chongwe will today meet Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe to seek SADC's intervention in Zambia's &quot;political crisis&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mugabe, who is chairman of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and Southern African Development Community's (SADC) defence and security committee, is being asked by Zambia's opposition alliance to intervene in time to stop what is happening in Congo Brazzaville and what took place in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) from taking place in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition Alliance chairman Chongwe and former president Kaunda will discuss the political situation in Zambia with President Mugabe. The meeting will take place this afternoon at State House in Harare.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We feel that SADC should play a major role in reconciling political leaders in this country so that they can resolve problems on the constitution and the electoral process,&quot; said Chongwe in an interview yesterday before he left for Harare. &quot;We want to persuade President Mugabe to take the initiative regarding what is happening here as chairman of defence and security committee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And reached for comment at his Avondale home MMD national secretary, minister without portfolio Michael Sata, asked the name of the reporter adding: &quot;Thank you and goodbye&quot; and cut the telephone line without hearing the query.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But MMD Lusaka Province chairman nominated member of parliament Christopher Chawinga pleaded tiredness after his trip to South Africa where he watched Zambia beaten 3-0.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have just come from South Africa. Let me rest. Get me tomorrow maybe I will comment,&quot; said Chawinga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chongwe revealed that the Opposition Alliance, which comprises UNIP, LPF, Labour Party, National Party, among others, appreciated the efforts initiated by IDEA, a Swedish Non- Governmental Organisation, but did not think it essential in resolving the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chongwe, who insisted that his organisation wanted &quot;to avoid what has happened in Zaire and what is happening in Congo Brazzaville&quot; said such destruction is now happening in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not think that matters can be resolved by using umpires outside the region like he meeting in Sweden,&quot; Chongwe said. &quot;We feel the initiative should come from leaders of this region because the political situation here is serious and is an African problem. Why should people fly all the way to Sweden in order to talk to each other.  It shows how immature the current Zambian leaders are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other opposition leaders have supported the alliance in its move to get SADC involved in the political impasse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We agree and entirely abide by the decisions of the Opposition Alliance,&quot; said National Party vice-president Daniel Lisulo. &quot;We should emphasize in the regional aspect but the problems with Africans they listen to European instead of fellow Africans. The problem is Chiluba.  He doesn't want to listen to fellow Africans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) deputy general secretary Azwell Banda, in an interview yesterday, said he has no doubt about the necessity for a regional solution to the political impasse in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banda said he sees the Swedish meeting as fitting the MMD - Consultative Group agenda which has no relevance to the problems in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are matters which are capable of spilling over to neighbours so SADC must be involved. At the end of the day SADC may be the only organisations which can guarantee the regional solution,&quot; Banda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MMD and UNIP leaders who went to Sweden to set pace for a possible 'dialogue' were simply there for a picnic because the ruling party has a history of dishonesty, ZDC general secretary Derrick Chitala said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chitala, in a walk in interview yesterday, said the trip was uncalled-for because the issues of dialogue between the government and other political parties could still have been dealt with at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The history of dealing with the MMD has been that of dishonesty and cheating at all times and Zambians are aware about this,&quot; Chitala said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the controversial issues that need to be discussed are well- known and these are the 1996 constitution, the 1996 elections and the electoral process which the MMD subverted through trickery and fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chitala charged that the MMD was massively plundering and mismanaging the country's economy to the extent where donors have stopped giving the Zambia balance of payment support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chitala said there is no way the country could progress with the current economy and accused President Chiluba's government of dividing the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is looming hunger in the country because of food shortage and the government needs millions of United States dollars, which it unfortunately does not have, to bring in maize and fertiliser,&quot; Chitala said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He reiterated ZDC's call for President Chiluba to resign and suggested that a national conference be called where Zambians will decide what next course to take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former UNIP secretary general and diplomat, Mainza Chona, yesterday described the MMD delegation to Sweden as not being &quot;high powered&quot; and that whatever was agreed there would not be upheld but thrown out by &quot;forceful elements&quot; within the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unless the donors are close to the MMD dialogue will not take off,&quot; Chona, said adding that church leaders must &quot;put pressure on the MMD&quot; to accept dialogue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And UNIP member of the central committee for political and legal affairs Mwangala Zaloumis yesterday expressed disappointment with the MMD delegation to Sweden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am disappointed with the MMD delegation. Opposition parties have gone to Sweden genuinely but the MMD motive seems to be fun,&quot; Zaloumis said, adding: &quot;We hope we are not being used as guinea pigs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And ZDC, in a press statement signed by the chairman of the legal and constitutional affairs, Wynter Kabimba, says the idea of going to Sweden to agree on the date and the need for dialogue had not been seriously considered by the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZDC welcomed the initiative of the Swedish International Idea for a dialogue in the form an inter-party meeting but it did not want to be hoodwinked into a mere preliminary meeting ahead of the Consultative Group meeting scheduled next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As petitioners of the elections on 1996, the ZDC was of the view that there was a great need to consult with the lawyers to determine and analyse the implication of a dialogue on the petition,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Mpumalanga's provincial government cannot pass five of its departmental budgets for the 1997/ 98 fiscal year and is in budgetary crisis after discovering that it will have a deficit of more than R900-million unless the province receives additional funds from national government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although officials declined to speak about the crisis on Wednesday, NP members of a number of legislative select standing committees confirmed that they would be attending an emergency meeting of all committee chairmen on Thursday to address the problem.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Select standing committees review and pass departmental budgets before they are ratified by the legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In just one department (education) for example, we are R400-million under budgeted. If the province is forced to cut back to conform to national expectations, then not one road, school, clinic or other facility will be built in Mpumalanga during 1997,&quot; explained NP leader, Dr Lucas Nel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nel added however that national government appeared &quot;sincere&quot; when it insisted that it did not have the additional necessary funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpumalanga received a R5-billion total budget for 1997/ 98, which is an effective 8,5% cut on last year's allocation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For every one Rand of this year's budget, 92 cents is spent on salary and other recurrent expenditure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capital expenditure, such as the building of schools and roads has already been cut by 36% but will have to be cut almost completely if the additional R900-million deficit cannot be covered by national government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Event organiser, Frank Jaschinski, said on Wednesday that at least 30 hangliders from across the country were expected to participate in the competition, which would run from Saturday morning to Monday evening.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said speed gliding had never been done in formal competitions in South Africa, but that recorded practise times were as low as 3 minutes 30 seconds over a distance of 2,8 kilometres at 2 100 feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The pilots will be expected to fly around 19 pilons, similar to snow skiers on downhill speed races,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also included in the competition line-up are spot landings, where pilots have to navigate their hangliders to land on markings on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The speed gliding and spot landings are technically demanding and are guaranteed to wow spectators,&quot; promised Jaschinski.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MBABANE (Swaziland) - Government officials from the Southern Africa Common Customs Area partners met In Mbabane on Monday to discuss the implications of South Africa's strengthening links with the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one day conference of officials from Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland (BLNS) on Monday discussed a confidential report prepared by a Zimbabwean consultant.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The countries fear that the development will affect the revenue derived from the customs union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given the current on-going negotiations, we are also considering this in the context of implementation of negotiations of the SADC Trade Protocol,&quot; an official at the conference said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The purpose of the conference is to listen to the findings of the report and &quot;discuss and identify a way forward to ensure the protection of interests of Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland (BLNS).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference which was also attended by SADC observer countries as well as the EU, looked at areas that are of particular concern to Swaziland and the rest of the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swaziland as well as Botswana and Lesotho have had preferential trade access to the European Union markets through the Lome Conventions since their independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, it has been acknowledged that the implementation of an EU(SA Free Trade Agreement will have a significant impact on other SACU members in terms of reduced tariff revenues and competition with European imports,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said both the EU and South Africa have made it clear that they will consider the legitimate concerns of other SACU members during the negotiations of the FTA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although South Africa's entry into the EU will affect SACU member states, it is believed that Swaziland is likely to benefit in the longer term from the dynamic economic impact of an EU(SA Free Trade Agreement on the South African Region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Webb said the unspecified but &quot;significant&quot; investment had been clinched during several meetings between RSSC and Tate &amp; Lyle.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The discussions follow an initial announcement by Tate &amp; Lyle chairman, Sir Neil Shaw one year ago that the multi-national was keen in principle to expand its presence in Swaziland because of the kingdom's &quot;proven expertise&quot; in sugar production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sir Shaw made the commitment after a personal meeting with King Mswati III said at the time that a series of possible investments had already been identified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe that being so efficient, the industry would be a base for developing other food products,&quot; Webb agreed on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tate &amp; Lyle are a Britain based company with 4,5 billion pounds sterling turnover and operate primarily in Western Europe and North America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent years however it has embarked on a heavy investment drive to find new markets in South East Asia, Eastern Europe, Central Europe and Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tate &amp; Lyle already buys about 30% of sugar produced in Swaziland for its refineries in England, Portugal and the United States of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tate &amp; Lyle also has a small equity interest in the Royal Swazi Sugar Corporation and also manages the company through associates, Booker and Tate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Mpumalanga Development Corporation (MDC) chairman Jabu Mabuza &quot;blatantly lied&quot; about his relationship with the parastatal's disgraced chief executive officer Patrick Mogorosi, the National Party (NP) said on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insisting during a press conference in Nelspruit that Mogorosi had married one of Mabuza's sisters, the NP's Mpumalanga whip Chris MacPherson questioned how this personal relationship had influenced the MDC's decision to keep a R300 000 &quot;golden handshake&quot; package to Mogorosi secret.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabuza has repeatedly denied any direct personal relations with Mogorosi, who resigned from the MDC earlier this year after being slated by an independent financial audit for &quot;gross irregularities&quot; and for tampering with various internal audits.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We find it very strange that the MDC decided to allow Mogorosi to resign without pressing criminal or other charges when both a Coopers &amp; Lybrandt report and their own internal investigations had found him guilty of gross personal misspending. Instead, they secretly paid him R300 000 of tax payer's money and promised never to speak about it in public,&quot; said MacPherson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We find it even stranger that Mabuza claims not to know that this man was married to his sister. He actually lied by denying the link at previous conferences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabuza again denied any family other personal relation to Mogorosi on Tuesday night and told African Eye News Service (South Africa) that he was &quot;dumbfounded&quot; by the NP's charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have sisters but they're either all still married or have never been married. Even my cousins are still married to their first husbands and none of these men is Mogorosi,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabuza did concede that the MDC has chosen to settle its dispute with the former CEO by paying him out R300 000, plus an unspecified sum for pension fund contributions and accrued leave but stressed that it &quot;was the cheapest way for us to close the book on this matter and Mogorosi agreed in return to leave without a fight&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pointing out that it had already cost the MDC R354 000 just to initiate disciplinary action against Mogorosi, Mabuza said that the amount could have doubled if it had been fought out in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also stressed that the additional irregular personal expenditure which had been uncovered during the disciplinary action had only totalled R5400.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mogorosi incurred the amount by illegally using his MDC credit card to buy clothing while in the USA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A letter from Mabuza to the MDC board shortly after the settlement also commented that by paying Mogorosi out, they were &quot;containing employee, press and political fallout.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling the &quot;containment&quot; unconstitutional and contrary to the government's state policy of transparency, MacPherson also asked why more than four of the officials who helped blow the lid on the irregularities were still being prosecuted for &quot;leaking&quot; information to an official legislative oversight committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The obvious message being sent out ... is that if you stand up against corruption or try to fight corrupt individuals in Mpumalanga you will be hounded out of a job and out of government,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if you steal, if you lie and if you cheat, then at worst all you'll have to do is pay the money back. To reward you for doing this, we'll give you a large package and promise never to speak about it again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Auditor General's special investigation into both the MDC and Mogorosi's term at the parastatal is expected to be released within the next three weeks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Chris King (e-mail: brodog@fastrans.net)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week marks the fourth anniversary of the June 12, 1993 elections in Nigeria, which were annulled by the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The freely elected president of Nigeria, Moshood Abiola, languishes today in solitary detention; the military, headed by Gen. Sani Abacha, remains in power. Abiola's wife Kudirat was assassinated just over one year ago; the crime, which is widely suspected to have been directed by the government, remains unprosecuted. To remember these crimes, and to spark discussion of the Nigerian crisis, the St. Louis Support Committee for the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) has invited Hafsat Abiola to town this Saturday, June 14. She is the daughter of the imprisoned president and the director of the Kudirat Institute for Nigerian Democracy (KIND).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria and St. Louis grew unexpectedly close this past year. In February of 1996, a handful of Nigerian exiles from MOSOP arrived in our town, including Noble Obani-Nwibari, vice president of the movement.  MOSOP is an environmental justice struggle that materialized in the oil- rich Niger Delta in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Led by much-loved author Ken Saro-Wiwa, MOSOP organized the Ogoni people (who number only 500,000 in a nation of 120 million) to protest the Nigerian military government and Shell Oil, which has operated in Ogoni since 1958 and, according to a slew of independent reports, severely devestated the environment there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saro-Wiwa also called for other minority groups from the Delta to organize and fight nonviolently alongside the Ogoni. The military, aided by Shell, responded with massacres and detentions, and finally executed Saro-Wiwa and eight other key activists on November 10, 1995. When those murders inspired no serious reprisals (like international sanctions on buying Nigerian oil, which accounts for 90% of the dictatorship's income), a manhunt was declared on other prominent MOSOP activists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that climate, Obani-Nwibari and many others fled to a refugee camp in a neighboring country maintained by the United Nations. Through the UN's High Commission on Refugees, they received political asylum in the U.S. Ten Ogoni live here now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early in their exile, Obani-Nwibari met local activist Bill Ramsey, who runs the St. Louis Human Rights Action Service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramsey got MOSOP networked with the local branch of The American Friends Service Committee, a Quaker-based pacifist organization. The MOSOP cause, promoted through documentary videos and speaking engagements, quickly attracted activists from Amnesty International and other groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A MOSOP support committee, headquartered in the AFSC office and coordinated by AFSC staffer Mira Tanna, took shape around monthly protests at local Shell stations. These protests attracted the attention of one of the world's most profitable corporations. Representatives of Shell-USA and even Shell-Nigeria have flown here to meet with members of the support committee (and used these meetings to falsely claim they are in dialogue with Obani-Nwibari, who did not attend the meetings).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The support committee spearheaded a lobbying trip to our nation's capital, which was reported in the Nigerian press, inspiring excitement among activists who remain in-country. Local Ogoni people, with the help of studio engineer Adam Long, also record programming for Radio Kudirat, the clandestine Nigerian pro-democracy radio station. From his couch in south St. Louis, Obani-Nwibari talks once a week to Nigerians, delivering scathing condemnations of the government that keeps him exiled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ogonis who seek environmental justice, and all Nigerians who seek democracy, face an uphill struggle four years after the annulled elections. At Shell's annual meeting in London this May, a dissident group of shareholders pressed the corporation on its environmental record. According to the Times of London, the resolution &quot;requested that a director be appointed to implement environmental policy; internal procedures to monitor policy; external review and audit of policies; regular reports to shareholders and a report on Nigeria.&quot; Over 10% of investors voted with them, not enough to carry the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ogoni, protesting Shell still guarantees suffering at the hands of the military funded by their petrodollars. When the Nigerian magazine TELL (June 2nd 1997 edition) ran photographs of Ogoni people protesting Shell, the Rivers State Internal Security Task Force, which occupies Ogoni, launched a man-hunt for those pictured. A number of activists have already been arrested, among them Eddy Nwikomah, who was &quot;tortured to a state of coma before he was taken to the Bori detention centre,&quot; according to a MOSOP press release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the larger pro-democracy front, June 12 is expected to be a symbolic day for protestors. The electronic news service Nigeria Today reports that The Inspector General of Police has ordered a round the clock security alert in six southern states, which &quot;have been mapped out for extra police monitoring to check protests that may be organised by human rights and pro-democracy groups.&quot; The military is no doubt responding in part to a new coalition, announced in May, of 22 national pro-democracy organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This coalition has been applauded by Nigerian Nobel prize laureate Wole Soyinka, another exile recently charged of treason, which carries the death sentence. The military has announced a transition-to-democracy program, which has been ridiculed by every pro-democracy group. Abacha clearly intends to run for president as a civilian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A forum of elders from the North of Nigeria, home to the Hausa majority ethnic group which dominates the military, has urged Abacha to delay the transition to the year 2000 (it is currently scheduled for October, 1998) &quot;in order to ensure true reconciliation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This quote alludes to the military's efforts towards &quot;national reconciliation,&quot; which has also been the subject of ridicule in pro- democracy camps. Not surprisingly, since the activism of the Ogoni still keeps Shell from operating fully in their rich oil fields, Ogoni was the first area of the nation set to be reconciled. Obani-Nwibari has broadcast against this on Radio Kudirat, saying the first people who should be reconciled are the Yoruba, Abiola's ethnic group, and they should be reconciled by releasing the man and recognizing his presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here in the U.S., oil sanctions are deemed the principal means of pressure against the dictatorship, given their almost-total reliance on petrodollars. Securing oil sanctions was the St. Louis-MOSOP delegation's purpose for lobbying Washington. Hafsat Abiola's organization KIND has recently alerted activists to the appeal Congressman William Jefferson made to the Congressional Black Caucus against oil sanctions; he called them &quot;not only unimaginative, but wrong-headed as a framework to increase U.S. policy effectiveness in Nigeria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abiola replied to him, &quot;It would help if the Congressman would define his measure of policy effectiveness. Was the past accommodating policy, in place from the 1970s till 1993, effective? During these two decades, the U.S. had a great deal of influence in Nigeria, in terms of the extent of economic interaction, military exchange programs and diplomatic intercourse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What were the results? Buttressing of politically corrupt governments that plunged Nigeria from a middle-income ranking country to its current position as fourteenth poorest in the world; failure by the civilian democratic government to secure the liberties provided for by the constitution; and the more destabilizing record of military incursions into the seat of political power (between 1970 and 1993, Nigeria witnessed six successful military coups and several other failed attempts!).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The presence of military in Nigeria has caused our people untold suffering,&quot; Obani-Nwibari says. &quot;The fair and free election of Moshood Abiola on June 12, 1993 was seen by the people of Nigeria as a way forward, a first step. The people in power in that country now are thieves and killers. The world should stop communicating with Nigeria economically and politically until all the military people go back to their barracks. They were not trained to rule, and no one invited them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - The controversial attempt by a Henties Bay businessman to establish if seal meat could be processed for human consumption has been terminated, pending the issue of a permit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secretary to the President, Dr Ndeutala Angolo, said yesterday that an investigation ordered by President Sam Nujoma, and conducted by Inspector of Hospitals and Health Facilities, Dr Iyambo Indongo, had found that the operation was only an experiment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As no permission has been obtained from the health authorities for conducting the experimental processing ... (it was) agreed to terminate the operation immediately ....&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the statement did not go into concerns about the way in which the experiment had been conducted or its potential health risk for residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerns over the dubious seal 'experiment' were raised by Henties resident Peter Whitham.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the centre of the storm was Sea Lion Products, holder of a seal quota, and its owners who conducted the 'experiment' on private premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Nujoma intervened in the dispute by appointing his personal doctor, Indongo, to investigate claims of an illegal, insanitary seal meat operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday's State House statement on the findings attacks Whitham who is accused of trying to sensationalise the whole issue by contacting the media, including overseas newspapers, in an &quot;alarmist&quot; way before an investigation could be completed by competent health authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He took photos of the operation from a secret place and supplied these photos to The Times of London, ostensibly aiming at embarrassing the Namibian Government,&quot; State House said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witham also contacted Chris Styles of the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) in Johannesburg with the same aim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We regard his methods as being in very bad taste and as a form of blackmail to further his political designs for Henties Bay,&quot; the State House statement claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President expressed his personal satisfaction with the outcome of the investigations by Indongo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier the Wildlife Society of Namibia warned that it would be dangerous to consume seal meat, until such time as it was known what virus was responsible for the recent death of thousands of seals along the coastline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the WLS added its voice to those calling for a thorough investigation into allegations of seal culling outside the official season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WLS said although it supported the sustainable utilisation of Namibia's resources, the recent decline in the seal population due to a lack of food and the impact of an unknown virus, had left seal colonies depleted in numbers and vulnerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Winston-Smith said flaunting of regulations for culling of seals should result in the withdrawal of licences for culling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WLS said once the inquiry was concluded, it should make public the source of the seal meat, circumstances in which the meat was acquired, time of killing and the proposed destination of the meat following processing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Fund for Animals Welfare (IFAW) had earlier described the Namibian seal industry as a complete mess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IFAW's David Barritt called on the Government to appoint a judicial inquiry to investigate the whole industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claimed that IFAW had samples of the seal meat from Henties Bay which had been sent for testing to Onderstepoort in South Africa to see if the meat was from recently slaughtered seals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IFAW also laid a charge against the operators of the Henties Bay seal project for allegedly breaking the Seals and Sea Birds Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barritt claimed that regulations had been flouted concerning the slaughter of seals and that in the past the Government had ignored its own scientists' recommendations on the size of the quota.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now we have an illegal, unhygienic seal processing plant in a backyard in Henties Bay and the Ministry of Fisheries is not clear what to do about it,&quot; Barritt said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - The killer disease Aids is tightening its stranglehold on Namibia and HIV/Aids could reach mass epidemic proportions unless urgent measures are taken to stem the tide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday the United Nations Development Programme revealed that the spiralling number of HIV/Aids cases in Namibia had made it the country's 'number one' killer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One in 15 Namibians could be dying of Aids by the year 2001,&quot; Country Programme Advisor for the Joint UN Programme on HIV/Aids, Mary Guinn Delaney said at yesterday's launch of the 1997 Namibia Human Development Report (NHDR) in the Namibian capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The picture we're trying to paint is one of urgency,&quot; Delaney underlined.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1996, 925 Namibians died of Aids, making it the new number one cause of death in the nation, statistics contained in the report reveal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report shows that the hardest hit areas are the northern regions of Omusati, Ohangwena, Oshana, Oshikoto, Kavango and Caprivi, which comprise 60 per cent of Namibia's population and account for 73 per cent of all reported cases of HIV/Aids infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to National Aids Control programme, statistics for the first quarter of 1997 the reported number of HIV/Aids cases already reflect nearly one-third of last year's total.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are currently 30 000 reported cases of HIV/Aids in Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Delaney said that after 'figuring in' unreported cases, the number was estimated to be more than 100 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from the toll in human lives, Aids is also having an impact on the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1996 the direct costs of caring for people with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (Aids) and HIV consumed almost three per cent of Namibia's total budget for health. This is set to rise to 13 per cent by the year 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indirect costs of the epidemic resulting from lost productivity, absenteeism, replacement and training could amount to 15,3 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product in the next four to five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health and Social Services Minister Dr Libertina Amathila, who also spoke at the launch, suggested that the social stigma often placed on those infected with HIV/Aids was a major part of the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Namibia many people are isolated when they're infected (with HIV/Aids) because it's a so-called shameful disease,&quot; Amathila said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of this there may be two ways they decide to go: they will say 'because I got this disease from either a woman or man I'm going to infect (them)' or you take your life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the statistics, there is evidence that the HIV/Aids growth rate can be curbed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amathila said the Ministry of Health and Social Services was currently running a pilot project at Walvis Bay which would train social workers to counsel those infected with HIV/Aids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we have counsellors that can inform people that this is not the end of the road and that this is not a shameful disease ... people will seek advice and seek counselling,&quot; Amathila said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delaney also listed a number of 'hope indicators'. The UN official pointed to high-level Government commitment to solving the problem, active programmes by the Ministry of Health and Social Services and a growing awareness countrywide of HIV/Aids, all of which she described as a good start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delaney also noted that there were no documented cases of HIV/Aids infection through blood transfusions in Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She expressed her belief in an NHDR suggestion which entailed a national plan for Aids education programmes with matching services such as counselling and health care that would be available in rural and urban areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This I'm happy to say is underway under the leadership of the Ministry of Health,&quot; Delaney said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anatomy Of A Killer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Official cases - 30 000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Estimated cases - 100 000</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Cases by 2001 - 300 000</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - United Nations officials yesterday revealed that in the last year Namibia has dropped from the 116th to the 118th wealthiest nation among 175 countries, and that Sub-Saharan Africa is the only developing region where poverty is on the rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a joint launching of the annual Global Human Development Report (HDR) and the Namibian Human Development Report (NHDR) for 1997, Minister of Health and Social Services, Dr Libertina Amathila, indicated that, despite recent successes, much still needed to be done to eradicate poverty in Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Namibia Human Development Report for 1997 shows some slight improvement,&quot; Amathila told a packed room at a city hotel. &quot;But we know that we have not yet bridged the gap between rich and poor.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1997 HDR focuses primarily on poverty and human development on a global scale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This year's national and global theme is poverty and the impact of HIV/Aids on human development,&quot; Amathila said. &quot;These are not unrelated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1997 NHDR highlights such factors as medical costs and the inability of those infected with HIV/Aids to work in the labour force as evidence that the disease not only a health issue but an economic problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although both reports reflect a continuing regional increase in education, literacy, access to potable water and infant mortality, they also stress the impact of HIV/Aids and inequity on national and international poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The HDR, which summarises literal poverty by analysing factors such as gender and rural/urban inequity, standards of living and life expectancy, indicates that despite the average Namibian per capita income, little has improved for most of the nation's poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The country fares even worse when it comes to human poverty,&quot; UN Resident Co-ordinator for Namibia, Stephen Adei, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Namibia has the worst record of human development vis-a-vis its income level in the world apart from Seychelles and Burundi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adei also reiterated what he calls a &quot;new force of impoverishment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to say that the Global Report singles out HIV and Aids as a most potent force against eradicating human poverty,&quot; Adei said. &quot;The changing faces of and new forces of impoverishment in Sub-Saharan Africa must be tackled head-on,&quot; he emphasised.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - Emotions are running high among former Koevoet and SWATF members who claim they have been excluded from Government assistance to former fighters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the latest development, the chairman of the Union of Ex-Koevoet and SWATF members, Salomon Fleermuys, has accused Cabinet of deliberately ignoring them when 11 000 former combatants from the northern and central regions were told to register for jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a memo to Cabinet, Fleermuys said they were deliberately excluded from the Government development as almost 85 per cent of their members came from Kunene, Erongo, Okavango, Caprivi, Omaheke, Hardap and Karas regions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are treated like scum, like creatures from another planet, maybe because we fought under the former South African government,&quot; Fleermuys said in his second missive to Government in less than a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We still have doubts about the reconciliation process in Namibia. We challenge you to prove us wrong and accommodate us in one Namibia and one nation,&quot; he challenged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an April letter addressed to President Sam Nujoma, the group threatened to mount suicide and bomb attacks if they did not receive a reply within 10 days to their demands for pay-outs they claim are still owed to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former fighters are claiming N$36 million which was earmarked as a pay-out for former fighters shortly after the country became independent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you forget us we will become terrorists and destroy peace and stability, and we will go back to bombing,&quot; said the letter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union wrote to Cabinet on May 19 again over the disputed N$36 million pay-out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Hage Geingob responded to their April demand in Parliament by saying &quot;if anyone intends to compromise peace, we will not sit idly by.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We reject this ultimatum, and we do not accept threats,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geingob told Parliament that South Africa had initially allocated N$24 million, and Namibia a further N$12 million for pay-outs to both former Plan and South African fighters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African amount was given to both ex-SWATF/Koevoet and Plan fighters but the amount allocated by the Namibian Government went to ex- Plan combatants, as Government thought their counterparts in SA would give the ex-SWATF/Koevoet soldiers a similar amount.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suggestions are based on completed studies and recent inflows into the country's dams.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy permanent secretary for Water Affairs Richard Fry said the proposal would be submitted to Minister Angula by the Department of Water Affairs this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A top-level decision was expected to be taken before the end of the month after which further consultations would be held with Angola and Botswana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It had been hinted that due to the good rains during the last rainy season Namibia would no longer treat the planned pipeline link as an urgent project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project involves completion of the Eastern National Water Carrier by constructing a 250km pipeline to link central Namibia to the Okavango River.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Water evaluation carried out by the Department of Water Affairs recently indicated that Namibia's Central Area had an assured supply of water for the next four and a half years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result it has been hinted that a slower track approach to the pipeline link, which has been viewed with skepticism by Botswana, would be taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This would mean that the deadline for completion of the pipeline would now probably be extended, with a timeframe of three and a half years as opposed to two years envisaged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This would give the Namibian Government enough time to mobilise funds and material needed for setting up the pipeline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Namibia plans to draw up to 20 million cubic meters of water a year from the shared river.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fears have arisen in Botswana over the possible impact the pipeline plan would have on the Okavango Delta and the Botswana government has said it would only be able to take a final stance on Namibia's plans once an environmental feasibility study has been completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is expected to be completed within the next three months.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - The American Committee On Africa (ACOA) welcomes the introduction by Congressman Donald Payne (D-NJ) of legislation imposing sanctions on the Nigerian military dictatorship. The bill, H.R.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1786, The Nigeria Democracy Act, would impose the first substantive U.S. economic sanctions against the military regime, a ban on new U.S.  corporate investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is important legislation that puts the United States firmly on the side of freedom in Nigeria, Africa's largest and potentially greatest country,&quot; said ACOA President Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker. &quot;The African American community has strong cultural and emotional ties to Nigeria and there can be no business-as-usual with a regime that is brutalizing 100 million African people there.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill was introduced by Rep. Payne in the House of Representatives on June 4, 1997 with 19 co-sponsors -- 14 Democrats and five Republicans. It would also legislate existing White House measures against the dictatorship, including a ban on Nigerian Airways landing rights and U.S. arms sales; visa restrictions; denial of U.S. economic aid except for human rights and pro-democracy programs; U.S. opposition to IMF and World Bank loans, and a freeze on the personal assets of members of the military government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACOA, the oldest Africa independence and human rights advocacy organization in the United States, has called for economic sanctions to support the restoration of democracy and human rights in Nigeria. The military government is extremely vulnerable to economic sanctions, particularly sanctions against the oil exports that provide almost all government revenue. The United States purchases nearly half of Nigeria's oil output each year and thus has powerful economic leverage over the regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Nigeria Democracy Act is a needed response to the continuing repression and violence of the Nigerian military dictatorship,&quot; said ACOA Executive Director Jennifer Davis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It gives a national voice to the growing grassroots Nigeria sanctions movement and sends an important message of solidarity to the Nigerian people who are looking to the United States to support their struggle for democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - The Botswana Defence Force (BDF) has stopped the sale inside the Sir Seretse Khama Barracks of privately-owned newspaper, The Gazette. Speaking to MISA on June 11, the supermarket manager Stanley Chivanga confirmed he was ordered by the Barracks Protocol Office &quot;not take The Gazette.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chivanga, a civilian employee, said he was not given reasons for this order. The order to stop the sale, Chivanga said, was still standing and that he would not take later editions of The Gazette unless it was lifted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Gazette sells 100 copies to the Sir Seretse Khama Barracks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">June 4 edition of The Gazette reports the order followed a front page story of May 21 edition titled &quot;Is the BDF a family Business?&quot; The Gazette says it had reported on its front page that the BDF reacted angrily to queries by the newspaper that the army commander Lieutenant General Ian Khama was &quot;running the BDF like a family business&quot;. The paper reports its distribution vehicle was sent back with the May 28 edition of The Gazette for delivery at the Sir Seretse Khama Barracks Supermarket. The Gazette's circulation's officer, Philip Mokgethi, however, said the same edition of the Gazette was allowed at other BDF barracks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BDF Public Relations Officer, Captain Mogorosi Baatweng, told MISA June 6, he was not aware of any order to stop the paper from circulating in the said barracks. Baatweng, however, told MISA June 11, he was investigating the allegation. Meanwhile, Mokone told MISA on June 9 it was likely the barracks would not receive subsequent editions as he said the order to stop the sale had not been lifted. Mokone said he spoke, on June 6, to the supermarket manager Chivanga who told him he had not received orders to resume selling The Gazette. While the circulation's officer Mokgethi said he had not taken the June 10 edition to the Sir Seretse Khama Barracks Supermarket as he was still waiting for the order to be lifted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - A senior government official has accused two journalists from the state-run media of conspiring with opposition parties to impose a news blackout on government undertakings, reports the Zambia Independent Media Association, (ZIMA/MISA-Zambia).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZIMA says deputy permanent secretary in Zambia's Eastern Province, Lameck Chibombamilimo, laid the accusation on June 6, a day after the national radio and television failed to broadcast a story on the handing over of a donation of vehicles to the province. Chibombamilimo handed over the donation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sydney Chilambu, a journalists for Zambia News Agency (ZANA) and Tobias Phiri for Zambia Information Services (ZIS), told ZIMA June 9, that Chibombamilimo called them to his office on June 5, demanding to know why the story was not broadcast. The journalists further said, despite assuring Chibombamilimo that the story was filed for broadcasting, he was unsatisfied. He instead accused them of &quot;conniving with the opposition to blackout government stories&quot;. The two journalists are based in Eastern Zambia and file their stories to their central studios in the capital Lusaka, about a thousand kilometers away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to ZIMA June 10, Chibombamilimo admitted to having summoned the journalists to register his &quot;dissatisfaction,&quot; saying: &quot;I told them that developments in the province must be known, the people must know what the government is doing for them.... I asked them whose interests they were serving if such stories were not being published.&quot; he said, adding: &quot;I would not like people to frustrate my work, I want the people of Eastern Province, including journalists, to back me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chibombamilimo's accusation against the journalists has, however, riled the Civil Servants Union of Zambia (CSUZ), which has demanded an apology. &quot;The harassment of our members is unacceptable and Chibombamilimo should unreservedly apologise... for the unnecessary harassment,&quot; said CSUZ general secretary Japhet Moonde in a statement on June 10. And ZIMA chairperson David Simpson said the decision to publish or broadcast stories was vested in the editors, therefore, journalists should not be victimised if stories have not been used.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To impose sanctions against Nigeria, and for other purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES June 4, 1997 Mr. Payne (for himself, Mr. Houghton, Mr. Chabot, Ms. McKinney, Mr. Smith of New Jersey, Mr.  Faleomavaega, Mr. Lantos, Mr. Ackerman, Ms. Norton, Mr. Porter, Ms.  Pelosi, Ms. Waters, Mr. Brown of Ohio, Mr. Olver, Mr. Manton, Mr. Shays, Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, Ms. DeLauro, Mr. Filner, and Mr.  Clay) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on International Relations, and in addition to the Committees on Banking and Financial Services, Transportation and Infrastructure, and the Judiciary, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A BILL To impose sanctions against Nigeria, and for other purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Act may be cited as the &quot;Nigeria Democracy Act&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Congress makes the following findings:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) The November 10, 1995, execution by hanging of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni environmental activists was carried out by the Government of Nigeria after a trial that ignored the fundamental standards of legal process, and despite the pleas for clemency by the African and international community, as well as the United States Administration, the Chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives, and the Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus and the co-chairs of the Human Rights Caucus of the House of Representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) The United Nations recommended in both March and April of 1996 that the Government of Nigeria release the bodies of the Ogoni Nine for proper burial and paid compensation to the families of the deceased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) This heinous action followed an October 1, 1995, ambiguous statement by Nigerian military leader General Sani Abacha, that the country would be returned to civilian democratic rule in three years, and a lifting of the ban on political parties while at the same time not repealing the Treasonable Offenses Decree which allows the arrest of anyone speaking against the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(4) General Abacha&quot;s announcement was pressured by the outrage of the international community for his March 1995 arrest and conviction to long prison terms by secret trial of some 43 persons for involvement in a so- called coup. Among those convicted and still incarcerated are former President General Olusegun Obasanjo, the only military leader in Nigeria to return power to democratic civilian rule, General Shehu Musa Yar- Adua, deputy to the President in Abaasanjo&quot;s Administration, and later, human rights activist Beko Ransome-Kuti.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(5) The people of Nigeria and the international community had been led to believe that the presidential election held in Nigeria on June 12, 1993, would result in a return to full democratic civilian rule in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(6) General Ibrahim Babangida, the head of Nigeria&quot;s military government at the time of the June 12, 1993, election interrupted the release of the election results on June 23, 1993, and later annulled the election, thereby preventing a return to civilian rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(7) The election process indicated that voters in Nigeria--a country with a population of approximately 90,000,000 persons comprising 250 ethnic groups and spread across 357,000 square miles--were expressing a spirit of national unity that transcended ethnic, religious, and regional allegiances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(8) The reported returns suggested that Chief M.K.O. Abiola of the Social Democratic Party was receiving a substantial majority of the votes cast, leading the poll in 20 of the 30 States in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(9) The annulment of the presidential elections resulted in various forms of civil unrest, which in turn led to the deaths of more than 100 persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(10) An interim government established by General Babangida on August 27, 1993, and headed by Ernest Shonekan, failed to win the support of the Nigerian people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(11) General Sani Abacha took power on November 17, 1993, appointing an unelected Provisional Ruling Council to govern Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(12) Chief M.K.O. Abiola was imprisoned in solitary confinement for over one year for pressing his claim as the elected democratic leader of Nigeria, and still remains incarcerated today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(13) The political and economic conditions in Nigeria have continued to deteriorate in the months since Abacha took control of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(14) The faith of the Nigerian people in the viability of the nation as a unified whole must be preserved, and the balkanization of Nigeria guarded against.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(15) The people of Nigeria have not accepted the continuation of military rule and have courageously spoken out in favor of the rapid return of democratic and civilian rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(16) On May 15, 1994, a broad coalition of Nigerian democrats formed the National Democratic Coalition calling upon the military government to step down in favor of the winner of the June 12, 1993 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(17) The confidence of the Nigerian people and the international community in the Provisional Ruling Council&quot;s commitment to the restoration of democracy can only be established by a sustained demonstration of a commitment to human rights, due process, and the return of civilian rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(18) The United States would prefer to have a relationship with Nigeria based upon cooperation and mutual support but cannot, and will not, condone or overlook the denial of democratic civilian rule, against the clear wishes of the Nigerian people, by the Provisional Ruling Council or any other body in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(19) The lack of support from the Nigerian authorities on drug trafficking issues forced the United States for the last 2 years to place Nigeria on the list of countries penalized for failure to seriously address the narcotics proliferation issue, thus endangering vulnerable youth in our communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(20) Continuing credible reports of widespread corruption and questionable business practices in the Nigerian Government and &quot;scams&quot; in the United States, and the lack of cooperation in addressing these problems by the Nigerian Government, further undermines Nigeria&quot;s credibility in the international community, and is a constant embarrassment to approximately 1,000,000 law-abiding Nigerian Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(21) Nigeria&quot;s leadership role on the African continent, especially in the area of peacekeeping, will be severely compromised by its failure to rejoin the world community of democratic nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(22) Nigeria was recently suspended from the Commonwealth, a forum linking Britain and former colonies, and African countries like South Africa have already called for diplomatic, economic, and sports sanctions, since the limited sanctions imposed by the United States Administration have had little effect in safeguarding the lives of the people of Nigeria and moving Nigeria toward democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEC. 3. DECLARATIONS OF POLICY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(a) Commitment to Unity and Democracy by the Nigerian People.--The Congress continues to support the Nigerian people in their commitment to unity and democracy as evidenced by their participation in the June 12, 1993, presidential election in Nigeria, and in their subsequent insistence on the return to full civilian and democratic rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(b) Actions Taken by the United States.--While the Congress endorses the limited steps taken by the Administration to demonstrate United States opposition to the annulment of the June 12, 1993, presidential election in Nigeria, more needs to be accomplished to encourage the restoration of fully democratic and civilian rule in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(c) Sanctions to be Implemented in Coordination With International Community.--The Congress declares that the sanctions against Nigeria contained in this Act should be taken in concert with the international community and the United Nations to the maximum extent possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(d) Increase in Democracy Building and Rule of Law Assistance.--The Congress declares that the finite foreign assistance resources of the United States Government provided to Nigeria should be re-prioritized within present budget levels in order that more funds can be expended for democracy building and the promotion of the rule of law through nongovernmental organizations in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEC. 4. SANCTIONS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF NIGERIA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(a) United States Measures To Promote Democracy and Human Rights.--</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) No assistance.--</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph (B), no assistance may be made available under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 or the Arms Export Control Act to the Government of Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(B) Exceptions.--The prohibition in subparagraph (A) shall not apply to assistance for democracy building and the promotion of the rule of law through nongovernmental organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) International financial institutions.--The President shall instruct the United States Executive Director of each international financial institution to vote against any loan or other utilization of the funds of the respective institution to or from Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) Air transportation.--Air transportation with Nigeria shall be prohibited in accordance with subsection (b).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's budget speech has brought out in sharp relief realities faced by South Africans in the process of transformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The thrust of the speech is the need for a new patriotism among all our people irrespective of political affiliation if we are to transform our country into a truly non-racial, non-sexist and democratic South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It exposes the continued existence of pockets of silent mobilisation against change in our midst, reflected in the opposition to any measure that seeks to redress the imbalances of the past.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reality is that unless far-reaching and fundamental measures are undertaken by the democratic government, the sacrifices of millions of our people in bringing about the dawn of peace, freedom and justice would have been in vain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this regard, the mammoth challenge of fundamental transformation remains not only that of the democratic government alone but a responsibility of all sectors of society in the sprit of Masakhane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Key to this approach is the need for the continued mobilisation of the masses of our people, the custodians of our democracy, in all their formations and sectors, to defend their hard-won gains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attempts at undermining national patriotic efforts should not only be criticised but must be exposed. This extends to resistance to transformation of the health services, the rational implementation of the national crime-prevention strategy, restructuring of the civil service and improvement of people's socio-economic conditions. It includes attempts at suppressing the truth about the systematic gross human rights violations by the previous regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We reiterate our commitment to a clean, accountable and transparent government. It is in this context that for the first time South Africa has been exposed to the extent of graft in government, essentially a legacy of the system of apartheid. Yet the masterminds of that system and their apologists would want the public to believe that those responsible for exposing corruption are themselves corrupt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where there is corruption, the ANC in government will not hesitate to act to uproot it without fear of favour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC believes that all South Africans must embrace without equivocation sentiments expressed in Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's speech and actively contribute, in the spirit of reconciliation and a sense of new patriotism, to the transformation of our country, for the sake of all its people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The Lansdowne/Wetton corridor is beginning to take shape with the drafting of a five-year development scenario which colours in precincts earmarked for a host of uses ranging from light industrial to recreational.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The draft plan is the result of extensive interaction with communities and businesses in the area.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interested parties have until July 12 to comment on the proposals, summarised in map form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The details on the five-year plan include the development of a Sunset Junction precinct which would be a mix of light industrial, commercial and retail along Lansdowne Road. Linked to this are several other smaller areas, among them Gateways to Hanover Park and Manenberg and a precinct at Fezeka which would provide for housing and civic facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on the cards is a new station close to Lansdowne Road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Gough, who is co-ordinating the planning project on behalf of the Cape Town municipality, said the five-year development scenario was a draft plan which was being put out for comment, and further detail would be needed for specific developments. The focal points were a central area in the vicinity of Sunset Junction, and the Philippi East business district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Gough said perceptions around development in the area were changing rapidly with big developments being mooted for the Philippi area. One of the issues which needed addressing urgently was the installation of basic infrastructure which did not exist on the unserviced land.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - A deal due to be signed in Johannesburg today sees a black economic empowerment consortium, which includes Cape-based investment grouping Ukhozi, take control of City Press, South Africa's biggest black-read Sunday newspaper, from Afrikaans language media conglomerate Nasionale Pers (Naspers).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consortium also includes Durban-based Dynamo Investments, which is headed by former Inkatha Freedom Party secretary general Oscar Dhlomo and New Season's Investments, a company headed by former KaNgwane chief minister Enos Mabuza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consortium successfully negotiated the sale for a 51% stake in City Press last month and will sign the deal today. The stake was bought for R110 million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ukhozi will own 10% of City Press, with 20% going to Dynamo and 10% to New Season's. A total of 6% of the shares will be made available to City Press' staff and the remaining 5% to the newspaper's distributors.  Naspers will retain a 49% stake in the newspaper, which has a weekly circulation of 250 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ukhozi managing director Lizo Ngcokoto said that as a result of the group's involvement in the acquisition he hoped that City Press would carry &quot;newsworthy issues relevant to the people of the Cape&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;City Press needs to make inroads into the Cape in a serious fashion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through the deal the consortium has also secured the pre-emptive rights to buy Drum and True Love magazines if Naspers should decide to sell them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ngcokoto said the consortium intended developing City Press into a formidable competitor to top-selling Sunday newspaper rivals the Sunday Times and Rapport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At this stage we are content with the acquisition of the newspaper but at the appropriate time we will approach Naspers about buying the magazines,&quot; Mr Ngcokoto said when asked whether the consortium had any immediate plans to buy Drum and True Love.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new shareholders must decide about buying the magazines,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ngcokoto said funds were raised through a major South African institution. He declined to name the bank or give details of the financial mechanism.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - South Africa has confirmed that it is willing to serve as a neutral venue for the trial of two Libyans accused of being behind the 1988 bombing of an airliner over Lockerbie in Scotland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given Libya's isolated and controversial position in the world - the United Nations Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on the country because of its refusal to surrender for trial two men accused of being responsible for an explosion on board a Pan American jumbo jet over Lockerbie in Scotland in 1988 - any country entering into a new agreement with the regime of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi could engender some measure of international disapproval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But judging from the remarks made by Libyan Foreign Minister Omar Muntasser when he signed a co-operation agreement in Pretoria this week, there is a new eagerness in Tripoli to see the Lockerbie issue settled once and for all and for sanctions against Libya to be lifted. This presents the South African Government with a unique opportunity to help bridge the chasm which now separates Libya from much of the rest of the international community.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo remarked this week that South Africa supported Libya's insistence on a neutral venue for the trial of the two Libyans accused of having been behind the Lockerbie bombing and a government spokesman confirmed yesterday that, if approached, South Africa would be willing to provide such a venue. This could be the catalyst in bringing about a reconciliation between major Western countries and an economically and strategically important country in Africa - a development which would be of undoubted benefit to the continent and the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African Government has demonstrated its skill at helping to resolve seemingly intractable diplomatic and political disputes and it should take the initiative in attempting to bring to a conclusion the longstanding tragedy of the Lockerbie bombing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The Congress of SA Trade Unions' (Cosatu) one-day general strike has come and gone, but questions about the federation's true motives for the action linger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers have asked whether Cosatu is fighting against provisions in the Basic Conditions of Employment Draft Bill or pressing its ruling alliance partner, the African National Congress (ANC), to renegotiate its Growth, Employment and Redistribution (Gear) strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federation's parliamentary officer, Neil Coleman, says the strike can be seen as a protest against the ANC Government's shift in economic policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To the extent that the elements of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act is based on the prescriptions of Gear - to undermine protection for the vulnerable, rather than extending them basic rights - then I suppose our strike on Monday is also against Gear,&quot; Mr Coleman told a meeting two weekends ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't need to apologise for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it was legitimate for Cosatu to protest against Gear, because the strategy represented a fundamental shift in economic policy from that outlined in the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosatu was the main architect of the RDP policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Gear strategy,unveiled last year, among other things emphasises labour market flexibility and stringent control over the budget deficit by reducing it to three percent by 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strategy also envisages the creation of a million jobs and a six percent economic growth rate by the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Cosatu says the Gear policy will lead to job losses and has asked the Government to renegotiate the strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mandela consistently has maintained that Gear is not negotiable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has said that his government would not be held to ransom in its efforts to improve people's lives by a small group within South African society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosatu said it went on strike to protest at the non-inclusion of six months' maternity leave, with four months paid, and a 40-hour week, which would be phased in over five years, on the draft bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour law expert Gavin Brown, however, has told the Cape Argus that Cosatu was deceiving the public by making out as if it had a dispute with the business sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This disagreement is simply a mask for a much bigger dispute between Cosatu and the Government,&quot; said Mr Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the strike was used by Cosatu to tell the Government they were not happy with Gear and that the federation needed more say in formulating economic policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a mistake to see this as a dispute between Cosatu and business,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, in spite of Mr Brown's assertion, the Department of Labour has chosen to send out different signals about its response to the dispute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour Minister Tito Mboweni told Business Argus that legislating a 40-hour working week, to which he had committed himself in the past, was still a priority of the Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said Cosatu's 40-hour week demand could not be implemented in one stroke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 40-hour week is a historical demand of the working class,&quot; said Mr Mboweni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whatever I think on a personal level, I don't work alone. I don't determine what market conditions are,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday's strike was the third national stoppage since the 1994 elections which brought President Mandela's government to power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That there have been problems between Cosatu and the SA Communist Party, on the one hand, and the ANC on the other, is an open secret that appears to have strained relations in the alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At issue has been the Government's economic policies and the pace of delivering essential relief to disadvantaged communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The secretaries of the Western Cape region of Cosatu and SACP, Tony Ehrenreich and Phillip Dexter respectively, openly admitted this during a National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union meeting last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extent of the odds at which the alliance partners are, was demonstrated by the fact that the SACP fully supported the strike and hardly a whisper was heard from the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During Cosatu's march to Parliament last week, ANC leaders were notable by their absence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SACP went further and publicly chastised the ANC in a statement and said it had abandoned its constituency which consisted mainly of the poor and the working class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The SACP expresses its solidarity and support for the Cosatu 24-hour strike tomorrow,&quot; the party's central committee said in the statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All attempts to block workplace democratisation in the name of competitiveness, flexibility or growth must be resisted,&quot; it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of the reported problems in the alliance, Cosatu secretary- general Sam Shilowa has denied an impending break-up of relations among the partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The alliance is united on the need to eradicate apartheid at the workplace and to extend worker rights and conditions that have systematically been denied over many years of oppression and exploitation,&quot; said Mr Shilowa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the apparent damage the disagreements have done to the alliance, Cosatu has stood its ground and threatened another strike if business does not accept its point of view on the draft bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they want to take a hard line, this is not a one-way street.  We'll also take a hard line to challenge them,&quot; Mr Shilowa has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they have nerves to continue the argument around workers' basic rights we will use our steel nerves to fight them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate over the draft bill has, however, taken an unexpected turn with the employer organisation, Business South Africa (BSA), saying last week that negotiations on the bill should be suspended until after the presidential job summit set for October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BSA deputy president Leslie Boyd has said business was concerned that some aspects of the draft bill could have a bearing of the summit and therefore slow job creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources close to Cosatu have told the Cape Argus that the federation had expected business to take a hard line against the federation demands and did not expect a proposal to stall the negotiations until the job summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sources said Cosatu would hold an executive committee meeting later this month to formulate a response to business's proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the outcome of the Cosatu executive committee meeting on June 24, or business' response to the federation demands, one question that begs answering is how much hammering the South African economy can take, while parties settle old scores.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - A top secret document sent to the State Security Council on the first day of the three-day &quot;witdoeke&quot; attack on the KTC squatter camp asked for R3 000 for a &quot;victory feast&quot; for the witdoeke in the form of a ritual cattle slaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document, dated June 9 1986, was sent from the Western Province Joint Management Committee (JMC) - the regional structure of the shadowy, nationwide security system of the former government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It continued: &quot;Finality, however, will not be reached before June 11 1986, when we will be in contact again.&quot; By that date, several thousand shacks in KTC had been razed and an estimated 60 000 of its residents were refugees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document was one of several &quot;top secret&quot; and &quot;secret&quot; communications between the State Security Council and regional security structures which were submitted to the Truth Commission yesterday on the final day of its three-day &quot;special event&quot; hearing focusing on violence in informal settlements in the Peninsula in 1985/86.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May and June 1986, KTC and three satellite squatter camps were attacked by witdoeke - also known as &quot;fathers&quot; or the conservatives - who were mostly from Crossroads and who owed allegiance to conservative leaders such as Crossroads mayor Johnson Ngxobongwana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police and other state officials have consistently denied colluding with the witdoeke in the attacks - also in their testimony during a Supreme Court action for damages by homeless squatters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some truth commissioners and a member of the commission's human rights violations committee said the secret documents provided clear evidence that the state had been directly involved in the conflict, which cost at least 57 lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Mapule Ramashala said the June 9 document referred to a specific celebration anticipating victory for the witdoeke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It places the hand of the state right squarely in the middle of it (the conflict) This document in fact confirms complicity (in) the annihilation of the satellites, including KTC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Dumisa Ntsebeza, who heads the commission's investigative unit, commented afterwards: &quot;It is quite clear in my mind that there was that kind of involvement by the State Security Council.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela, a member of the commission's human rights violations committee who organised the KTC hearing, said both the documents and the forthright testimony by former Crossroads town clerk Ricky Shelhase yesterday had indicated that the state had been trying to create &quot;a kind of bantustan&quot; at Crossroads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is very clear that the government was manipulating the violence, setting up the two groups (&quot;comrades&quot; and &quot;witdoeke&quot;) and then pulling back so that it seemed like a war.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Western Cape Police Minister Gerald Morkel has warned criminals there will be an all-out war on their activities now that big business has joined the fight against crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the launch of the Business Against Crime initiative at a Green Point hotel last night, Mr Morkel said the partnership between the police and the business sector was necessary to stop crime.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the first time organised business at the highest level has officially accepted that they have a vital role to play in this war we are fighting against criminals. These businessmen bring with them the expertise and skills which in conjunction with our police service must effectively fight crime,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prominent banker Mike Thompson, who was elected chairman of the initiative, said the time had come for the streets of Cape Town to reflect what most of its citizens wanted - safety and peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A four-pronged &quot;attack&quot; which had already been implemented in Gauteng, KwaZulu Natal and the Eastern Cape would now be launched in the Western Cape, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This four-pronged strategy will include fighting crime, researching and advising the government on legislative measures and developing initiatives to secure economic upliftment and community rehabilitation,&quot; said Mr Thompson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Thompson said that although they had the overwhelming support of the bid company and many of their objectives were the same as those of Chris Ball's team, the initiative was in response to President Mandela's plea that business play its part in fighting crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Daniel from His People Church in Rondebosch, who was elected to handle the portfolio on community rehabilitation, said crime transcended religious and ideological differences. &quot;The goal is crime rehabilitation and we will be working right from grassroots up to the prisons in the Western Cape.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - South Africa's success in helping to resolve international disputes may soon be followed by an effort to get United Nations sanctions against Libya lifted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This could be done by South Africa offering to provide a neutral venue for the trial of two Libyans accused of the 1988 bombing of an American airliner over Lockerbie in Scotland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Department of Foreign Affairs spokesman confirmed yesterday that, if approached, South Africa would be willing to provide such a venue.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This follows the signing in Pretoria earlier this week of a co- operation agreement with Libya, and South Africa's initiatives in resolving disputes in Zaire, Angola, Mozambique and Northern Ireland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the signing of the agreement Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo and Libyan Foreign Minister Omar Mustafa Muntasser both referred to the Lockerbie bombing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 250 people were killed when a Pan American jumbo jet exploded over the Scottish village of Lockerbie while en route to New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libya, which has been sheltering the two men suspecting of being behind the bombing, has refused to hand them over for trial in either Britain or the United States, instead insisting on a neutral venue. The United Nations Security Council responded by unanimously imposing wide- ranging sanctions on Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Muntasser said this week that Libya was offering South Africa access to its crude oil - something specifically banned by UN sanctions - and said Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi could visit South Africa by the end of this year &quot;if sanctions are lifted&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under UN sanctions no country may assist in the flight of airliners to or from Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa supports an Organisation of African Unity resolution which backed Libya's call for a neutral venue for a trial of the Libyan suspects under Scottish law and with Scottish judges presiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, The Hague - seat of the International Court of Justice - was suggested as a trial venue but this was rejected by the US. The constitution of the World Court does not allow it to hear criminal cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Affairs spokesman Pieter Swanepoel yesterday denied speculation in diplomatic circles that South Africa had already offered a trial venue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he confirmed that South Africa was willing to provide a neutral venue if asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the US embassy in Pretoria said that to the best of his knowledge there had been no communication between the South African government and Washington about such an offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US had consistently asked Libya to comply with a 1991 UN resolution that the suspects should be handed over for trial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A political analyst is how he would probably be described, one who has lectured on South Africa at universities, colleges, schools and think-tanks overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Explaining South Africa to the world has become my business,&quot; says Silke, whose academic background is in politics and political philosophy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I have also knocked on doors and campaigned and listened to people's problems in their homes (he stood as a candidate in the ward of Woodstock in the 1994 election).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's all very well to study politics in its academic form ... but frankly, there's a different world on the street, and the experience I gained from being a political candidate was probably one of the more humbling experiences of my life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Silke has just returned from a cruise on board the Crystal Symphony, lecturing on South African politics (he lectured on two other cruise ships previously).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He tells me that he enjoys the interaction with the cruise passengers, and it's not difficult to see why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A devoted Democratic Party member, newly elected city councillor and ardent protagonist of liberal values, Silke talks easily and is easy to talk to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is an insatiable interest in South Africa overseas, and everywhere this country is regarded as having made a successful transition from minority government to a multiparty democracy, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a standard three-course lecture series that I offer cruise companies - it is an introduction to South African politics ... there is a bit of history about the development of apartheid, a bit about contemporary South Africa and the new constitution, and then some crystal-ball gazing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last part draws the most response and is also a lot of fun, says Silke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, everyone is their own political analyst and their own political fortune-teller, and the fun is to see whether my predictions tally with yours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He laughs when asked whether he would like to share some of his predictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the questions I am asked most often, and not surprisingly, is about a South Africa without Mandela.Will the country be able to hold together and not disintegrate into chaos and anarchy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that the African National Congress will in all likelihood be the majority party after 1999, we will probably see a fairly smooth transition to a new ANC leadership, he predicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If (our new leader ) is to be (Thabo) Mbeki, I think we are going to see a smooth seamless move towards an Mbeki presidency which will have different characteristics to that of Mandela.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our biggest problems and &quot;critical issues&quot; are going to be economic growth and the development of a free market policy that encourages foreign investment, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the omnipresent subject of crime, he worries that apart from the physical threat which affects &quot;every person in South Africa on a daily basis&quot;, far worse is a process which demoralises &quot;young and upwardly mobile South Africans who are able to emigrate&quot; and causes people to withdraw from the community and to &quot;bury their heads in the sand&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is too much focus on emigration prospects and too little devoted to constructive work within our own communities&quot; says Silke, who advocates that young people &quot;become involved, as participation leads to major rewards&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one can accuse him of not practising what he preaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He serves on a local police forum, which he says helps him to better understand the problem of crime and &quot;gives me encouragement and a degree of control&quot; over the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently elected as chairman of the Association of Liberal Democratic Councillors of South Africa, he claims that this country &quot;desperately needs to apply liberal philosophies to governance&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My interest in liberal politics began when I was about 13 when I joined the then Progressive Federal Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More than half of my life (he is now 32) has been spent attached to one political party and working and actively campaigning for that party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is currently branch chairman of the Democratic Party in the Atlantic suburbs area and serves on various party bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is convinced that South Africa needs a resurgence of liberal values and a move away from ethnically based politics if it is to survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to promote the individual as the cornerstone of society...  that's something that is very important for me - the right to be an individual, the right to think what I want to, the right to dissent (very important in South Africa) and these go hand in hand with the free market economic policy, controlled privatisation and with preserving multiparty democracy in South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - A photograph of three policemen posing hunter-style, one with his foot on their &quot;trophy&quot; - the body of a man killed in political violence - is proof that security forces treated black people &quot;like animals&quot; under apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This assessment comes today from Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela, a member of the Truth Commission's human rights violations committee, after viewing photographs given to the Cape Argus by a Mitchell's Plain man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man, whose moral conscience was fired by the TRC's &quot;special event&quot; hearing this week into violence in the Peninsula's informal settlements in 1985 and 1986, said the photographs were taken in KTC while it was being destroyed by &quot;witdoeke&quot; (conservatives) in 1986.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man, a rigger by trade, acquired a set of photographs from a friend who worked at a picture processing business. They appear to have been taken by a policeman or soldier during the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pictures, nearly all of which are too gruesome to publish, show victims who have been hacked to death with sharp instruments and &quot;necklace&quot; victims - some reduced to charred bones and others still alight. Other pictures show securityforce members with several bodies on the ground next to them and victims with hack wounds being taken to an ambulance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the worst shows three policemen, armed with shotguns, clearly posing hunter-style with their &quot;trophy&quot;, the body of a black man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Truth Commission staff who were given a brief glimpse of some of the pictures yesterday said they did appear to have been taken around KTC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man, who gave the Cape Argus his name, contacted the newspaper this week. He said he had no problem with giving all his particulars to the TRC and asked to be put in touch with its investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cape Argus today handed enlargements of some of the photographs to Truth Commissioner Dumisa Ntsebeza, who said the photographs would be useful - &quot;especially because we are looking at expanding (our evidence) on the State Security Council connection with violence in the area&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Gobodo-Madikizela said similar pictures had been presented at the inquiry earlier this year into the deaths of the so-called &quot;Guguletu Seven&quot;, shot dead by police in 1985.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The photograph of the three policemen &quot;demonstrates very clearly the brutality of the police, and the animalisation of black bodies that was so common at the time&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It reflects the attitude of the police at the time, so it adds a very important dimension to our understanding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the photographs had been taken in KTC/Crossroads, they would be of use in the commission's inquiry, she added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Embattled University of Zambia (Unza) vice chancellor Andrew Siwela has maintained his administration currently facing charges of embezzlement and mismanagement is clean and dismissed the allegations as blatant lies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Siwela, leading a delegation which included his deputy Jorry Mwenechanya, registrar Michael Tandeo and bursar Mafukeni Tembo also heaped the blame on Government for the ungovernable state of the campus because of its non-committal stance towards serious issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof Siwela, 50, Mwenechanya, Tandeo and Tembo all 41, appeared jointly before the Bobby Bwalya Commission of Inquiry yesterday and said most of the allegations could be substantiated with supporting documents but striking university workers had denied them access to their offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two professors, Siwela and Mwenechanya said their controversial 25 per cent shares in Zamnet Communications System were held in trust because the two had a primary objective to ensure quality service to academics.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that by virtue of being a board member Health Minister Katele Kalumba was offered 12.5 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They named other board members as the director of the computer centre, former Zamtel managing director Swathulani Munthali, Siwela, Mwenechanya, the registrar and bursar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said in submissions which took a whole day the relationship between Zamnet and the university was strictly business as evidenced by the rent collected from Zamnet and Unza subscriptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the alleged disappearance of dividends from York Farm, Prof Siwela confirmed management claimed an amount of K654m and were proposing to council to use the money to liquidate a $2.2m Government loan obtained to buy the farm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Unza partners Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) held 17 per cent in shares and that after injection of $4.1m into operations CDC's shareholding would increase to 51 and Unza 49 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However a manager a Mr Youngson was being paid $25,000 per month to run the farm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Tembo said it was justifiable for the institution to hold numerous accounts considering it handled amounts close K14.5bn and maintained the accounts were currently 36 and not 48.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the K45m was paid to Carpet Centre Travel agency to clear a debt of K56m owed in air tickets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof Siwela said all the allegations levelled against him which included an aborted trip to Livingstone in which he received K7m and Ghana, were lies and aimed at destroying his personal reputation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am being called a thief and blasted left, right and centre but these allegations are all lies. And all this information is filtering to the international audience through Internet. This is a perfect recipe to destroy an academic institution,&quot; Prof Siwela said with a quiver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pleaded with chairman Bwalya to protect management against further humiliation from unruly workers who seemed to disrespect the commission's existence by denying the principal officers access to their offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that Government should urgently review the Health Services Act to recognise the University Teaching Hospital as a centre for medical training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Tembo recommended that Government should without delay establish a loans and scholarships board which should be a semi-autonomous to institute a more sustainable mode of student funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On student welfare, Mr Tandeo said to decongest the university, expansion of distant education should be promoted while some existing higher education institutions should be transformed to offer university programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mwenechanya said to improve the working atmosphere at the institution Government should urgently consider the proposed scheme for the sale of houses to staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Government's delay to respond had resulted in mistrust of management by staff thus lowering their working morale Prof Siwela defended Health Deputy Minister Nkandu Luo for continuing to teach despite resigning to pursue politics as she did so because of the acute shortage of lecturers adding that pathology head of department Dr Cecilia Shinondo should have been more diplomatic on the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Management said Government lent a deaf ear to their requests citing that salary negotiations for all category of staff had stalled because Government had not furnished them with the negotiation sealing causing anxieties among workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government had not approved a university home ownership scheme, strategic plan 2001 and was dilly-dallying over student finance review resulting in student unrest and bursaries owing the institution about K454m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof Siwela charged that the ministry was leaking documents to staff and students and said the permanent secretary had alienated the institution by not attending Unza council sittings on which he was member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the leaking of documents was the source of the last week's strike by general workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During questions, the commissioners demanded to know why the librarian had been sidelined yet in the Act stipulated he was a principal officer to which Prof Siwela replied, the office had nothing to offer to central management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said historically the office had been excluded from management and said the librarian was only complaining because he envied the fringe benefits other principal officers like the vice chancellor enjoyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Quite frankly I do not see what he (the librarian) can contribute to central administration. His job is just to manage a unit,&quot; Justice Bwalya adjourned the submissions to today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a former secretary to the bursaries committee said problems at Unza and Copperbelt University (CBU) could have been avoided if the two vice-chancellors had time for members of staff and students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Patson Simwawa said in a written submission to the Unza/CBU Commission of Inquiry that during his tenure he observed that the two vice-chancellors had no time to attend to students and staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most often senior staff were not consulted over important issues leaving them to discover only through the Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He lamented that administration had a tendency to dissociate itself from student funding claiming that it was strictly between the sponsors and sponsored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said this was wrong as when disruption of studies occurred because of non-payment or delayed allowances administration was quick to move in and close the institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Simwawa also blamed Government for making contact with students only when there was a crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ministry of Education should be more open and always tell the truth.  They should not act under pressure and only in a crisis as is always the case,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The striking workers at the university of Zambia Great East Road campus in Lusaka have acted irrationally by persisting with the strike in which they are demanding the removal of the entire administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is strange that while a Government appointed commission of inquiry is gathering evidence on the problems of the institution and that of the Copperbelt University, the employees have elected to go on strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among their demands include the call to President Chiluba to intervene in the crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is President Chiluba who appointed the current commission of inquiry that is probing the problems of the university, how else would they want the matter resolved? We feel that workers have taken the matter too far. If they have a case at all it is positive to allow the current commission to finish its task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demanding the removal of an administration using rather unorthodox means is not the humane way of resolving issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by appointing the commission of inquiry Government recognised that there was a problem at Unza that needed a lasting solution. We do not think the Unza workers will achieve anything by trying to use short cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We feel that by insisting with the strike the employees are creating a crisis where there is none. Making the institution ungovernable at the moment is no solution in anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact after the employees blocked management from going into offices police should have moved in to restore order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether or not the workers have a case, there is no excuse in resorting to hooliganism. Moreover the current arbitrator over the Unza saga is the commission of inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workers are still free to go and testify, otherwise the most positive thing to do now is to call off the strike and allow management officials that have been barred to go to the offices and begin work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unza has enough problems without creating any more. The continued strike will delay progress being made on the efforts to seek solutions on the issues there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already a lot has been lost by the continued closure of the institution. It is with this in mind we appeal to the University of Zambia Workers Union (Unzawu) to restrain its militant members and advise them that there is a more rational way to seek a solution to the problem at Unza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union should entice members to do one thing sensible; call off the strike and allow sanity to return to the campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unrealistic demands are not just hollow but will retard progress made and just delay the reopening of the university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the moment the strike is unjustified the earlier it is called off the better. Enough damage has bee caused to the institution the intergrity of its administrators and the workers too.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Zambia's Commonwealth heavyweight hopeful Joseph Chingangu leaves for London tonight for next Tuesday's crack at the 'club' title against Briton Julius Francis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boxing Board of Control (BBC) chairman Hilary Matyola who confirmed the departure in Lusaka yesterday, said Chingangu flies out with his trainer Mike Zulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matyola said Chingangu, whose camp received two tickets from British promoter Frank Maloney on Tuesday, was ready for the 12-rounder set for Grondy Park Chesnont.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chingangu, whom I've seen train, is more than ready for the fight.  We hope that he wins so that he gives the Zambians something to cheer about after last weekend's soccer debacle in South Africa,&quot; Matyola said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BBC chief said the new Sport, Youth and Child Development Permanent Secretary Gerald Nyirenda who flies to London on business on Saturday would watch the fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chingangu, the Iron Nkhoma Promotions boxer, has been in intensive training at Evelyn Hone college gymnasium in Lusaka for about a month under Zulu and Alpha Kasonde.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambian heavyweight boxer-who out of his 17 professional fights has won 15, 12 of which were knock outs and lost two- admitting that he knew nothing about his opponent, said he was ready for the fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am ready for the fight as I am set to make a new beginning in my career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The junior IBF title I won last year was just there to fool me into believing I was a world champion I never was,&quot; Chingangu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chingangu and Francis were chosen from 13 top contenders, who included Lenox Lewis, to fight for the title which fell vacant after British boxer Scott Welch failed to defend it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chingangu is the second Zambian after light welterweight Felix Bwalya, who lost on points, to fight for the 'Club' title in two months.  In his last fight, Chingangu knocked out Zimbabwean Anderson Saizi in the second round last December.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Power (1) 3 Wanderers (0) 1 MUFULIRA Wanderers loss to Power Dynamos in Kitwe yesterday, the league champion's fifth consecutive defeat left more questions than answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is everything alright at Wanderers? Wanderers were disappointing, disjointed in all departments and their supporters were left admiring the swift Power side extend their lead at the top of the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not even the inclusion of internationals Paul Chellah and Nelson Banda could redeem Wanderers who allowed Power to dominate the afternoon earlier thought would be used to open a new leaf.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wanderers who have not won a game since losing to Zamalek in the African Club champions league match two months ago, only helped Power extend their unbeaten run and points tally to 23 in nine outings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Veteran Linos Makwaza's header in the 20th minute sent Wanderers on the slippery road to defeat before Peter Chitila and Douglas Chiwaya sealed the victory in the 73rd and 89th minutes respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wanderer's face saver came through substitute Boscher Chibwe who caught Power goalkeeper Pelewe Delamogo off guard in the 80th.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chibwe, relatively unknown, had come in for another recruit Leo Mukwasa at change ends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wanderers goalkeeper Collins Mbulo was sent off after a crude tackle on Simon Mwansa in the box which earned Power a penalty neatly tacked away by Chitila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbulo's departure left Wanderers one man down after referee John Commander of Luanshya who ruled the foul constituted dangerous play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Wanderers bench could not hide their anxiety and quickly sacrificed Banda to infuse in reserve goalkeeper Charles Mwila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwila was later to concede two goals as Wanderers slipped to defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Peter Kaumba, the Power trainer was expressing happiness, Wanderers coach George Lwandamina said the loss was very painful and unfortunate because the players were playing like were protesting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wanderers disciples revealed that Lwandamina whose team lost 4 - 2 to Zamsure soon after the Zamalek 6 - 2 aggregate defeat, 2 - 1 to Lifebuoy Strikers and 2 - 0 to Nchanga Rangers had been given the Power game to win or else...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources said the Wanderers executive held a meeting with players at which Lwandamina was top on the agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fans trooped out of stadium wandering what had befallen their team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zamsure 2 Rangers 2 At Woodlands stadium in Lusaka, Zamsure and Nchanga Rangers battled to a 2 - 2 draw after some intelligent play displayed by the visitors, reports TIMOTHY SICHELA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zamsure, enjoying home ground advantage scored first through Kelvin Mutambo after only 12 minutes of play after White Mbewe was brought down for a penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Laughter Chilembi equalised four minutes later, sending the match into an exciting climax as both teams fought head on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zamsure however shrugged off a Rangers challenge and took the lead in the 39th through defender Kingsley Ntosha and they were not so lucky when their foe Daddley Fichite split the points in the 46th minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The match between Roan United and City of Lusaka at Kafubu stadium in Luanshya was not played.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">City said they were only informed about the encounter yesterday morning which made it impossible for them to travel to Luanshya.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - British Airways (BA) has changed its corporate identity as part of the *1bn investment in new services, aircraft, facilities and training in the next three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BA displayed its new image in Zimbabwe, London, New York, Dubai, Bombay, Bangkok, Australia, France, Germany and Hong Kong on Tuesday, June 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The launch of the new concept of the company, dubbed &quot;painting the skies&quot; was centred on donning of its aircrafts' tails in colours and designs derived from different destination countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New paint technologies, new processes and advanced technology have been harnessed by a team of 36 BA engineering paint technicians to convert the original designs from sketchpad to the skies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the core of the new identity is the use of the original world images, which have been applied to the tails of 308 aircraft in the BA fleet. The aim is to represent BA as a community passionately committed to serving the communities of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The launch in Africa was characterised by pomp and splendour at Victoria Falls town in Zimbabwe where a BA aircraft painted with a Japanese design was flown over the Victoria Falls which is shared with Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimbabwe event coincided with the unveiling of the recently announced Comair service. In London the event involved unveiling of newly painted aircraft at Heathrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BA chief executive, Bob Ayling, noted that the world was getting smaller, technology was changing the way people communicated and competition was getting tougher but most important of all was that expectations of customers had changed and so BA had to change its identity accordingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the *6bn investment for the next three years, 43 new aircraft would join the airline's fleet including 29 Boeing 747-400s, nine 777 and five 757s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of millions of pounds would be spent during this period on new services and products, new routes, a new approach to customer service and new ways of working with employees, all aimed at providing better levels of service.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Zambia's total export earnings last year plummeted by 19.5 per cent and Government has been urged to get out of its slumber and help draw strategies for the business community to flood the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) with Zambian goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speakers at the Economics Association of Zambia (EAZ) monthly discussion decried that Zambia always lagged behind in exploiting export opportunities to markets where the country had great advantages such as Congo-Kinshasa had become after the political changes there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1995 Zambia's total export earnings including copper and cobalt amounted to $1,237,980,000 but this fell to $996,755,022. The decline was attributed to the decline in production of copper and cobalt.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Export Board of Zambia (EBZ) director, Mutale Musonda, said the DRC was Zambia's single largest market in the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa) region with 37 per cent of total non- traditional exports (NTEs) going to that country in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DRC was followed by Zimbabwe at 29 per cent. There was urgent need for the Zambian Government to conclude bilateral trade agreements with the DRC to ensure a firm grip on the Congo-Kinshasa market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other countries with which Zambia must conclude bilateral trade agreements are South Africa and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out of total NTE earnings of $242,555,022 the Comesa region represented $88,241,985 of which the DRC was highest at $32,848,092 compared to Zimbabwe's $25,479,845.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The DRC is currently Zambia's largest single market. The potential that the market presents is far from exhausted and the onus is on Zambian business to attack the market much more aggressively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To improve trade relations with the DRC it would be extremely useful and beneficial for Zambia if a bilateral trade agreement were entered into as soon as possible,&quot; Mr Musonda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (ZACCI) chief executive, Gideon Phiri, echoed Mr Musonda's sentiments and warned that Zambia was not ready at present to exploit its full potential in the Congo market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa, Zimbabwe and Mozambique were now looking north and Zambia must move fast to dominate the DRC market but Government must lead the way by putting in place the vital trade agreement for business to take over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rich Shaba province of the DRC has a population of nine million people and that was a huge market for Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was need for establishment of a Zambian bank in Lubumbashi to facilitate financial transactions, business people must build factories and warehouses close to the border with Shaba province of the DRC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alex Mwanakasale from the Zambia National Farmers Union (ZNUF) said 70 per cent of Zambia's exports to the DRC comprised agricultural products including maize, mealie meal, cotton lint, eggs, chickens, chicks, stockfeeds, beef, potatoes, sugar and onions. The exports go to Shaba province which has a population of nine million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out of the $32.8m worth of exports to DRC in 1996, $25m or 76 per cent were agricultural products : Sugar $16.6m, maize $6.6m, mealie meal $0.98m and other products $0.9m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government must ensure that it hammers out customs formalities with its DRC counterpart for standard business to flourish between the two countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The 24 per cent fuel hike effected yesterday will distort the Zambian economy which was cementing its stability, the Economics Association of Zambia (EAZ) has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EAZ believes the National Oil Company's (NOC's) reasons for the increase were not convincing, taking into account that economic indicators were reflecting stability.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The monthly inflation rate running below 25 per cent last month, and exchange rates having been stable were signs of an improved economic performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EAZ chief executive Amos Nakalonga said in Lusaka yesterday that the NOC could be unduly spreading their operational problems to the ordinary citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is unfair for National Oil Company to start spreading its own problems to the ordinary Zambians. The cost of living has already been too high in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is likely to distort the general economic performance of Zambia because the hike is too high. We have not seen a fuel increase of this much before,&quot; Mr Nakalonga said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The factories would be equally affected because the cost of production automatically goes up and therefore, their products would be more expensive. Fuel was a major input in any process of production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Personally, I think the increase is unjustifiable. The company has been pouring money inTO sports, creating problems for itself. And now they want to use the public to offset their losses. It's disgusting,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NOC increased prices of all petroleum products by 24 per cent, attributing it to the upward adjustment of refining and pumping rates by Indeni Petroleum Refinery and Tazama Pipelines to cater for capital maitntenance costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NOC claimed the petroleum price adjustments had not been reflecting the obtaining international prices and costs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - The American Committee On Africa (ACOA) welcomes the introduction by Congressman Donald Payne (D-NJ) of legislation imposing sanctions on the Nigerian military dictatorship. The bill, H.R.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1786, The Nigeria Democracy Act, would impose the first substantive U.S. economic sanctions against the military regime, a ban on new U.S.  corporate investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is important legislation that puts the United States firmly on the side of freedom in Nigeria, Africa's largest and potentially greatest country,&quot; said ACOA President Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker. &quot;The African American community has strong cultural and emotional ties to Nigeria and there can be no business-as-usual with a regime that is brutalizing 100 million African people there.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill was introduced by Rep. Payne in the House of Representatives on June 4, 1997 with 19 co-sponsors -- 14 Democrats and five Republicans. It would also legislate existing White House measures against the dictatorship, including a ban on Nigerian Airways landing rights and U.S. arms sales; visa restrictions; denial of U.S. economic aid except for human rights and pro-democracy programs; U.S. opposition to IMF and World Bank loans, and a freeze on the personal assets of members of the military government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACOA, the oldest Africa independence and human rights advocacy organization in the United States, has called for economic sanctions to support the restoration of democracy and human rights in Nigeria. The military government is extremely vulnerable to economic sanctions, particularly sanctions against the oil exports that provide almost all government revenue. The United States purchases nearly half of Nigeria's oil output each year and thus has powerful economic leverage over the regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Nigeria Democracy Act is a needed response to the continuing repression and violence of the Nigerian military dictatorship,&quot; said ACOA Executive Director Jennifer Davis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It gives a national voice to the growing grassroots Nigeria sanctions movement and sends an important message of solidarity to the Nigerian people who are looking to the United States to support their struggle for democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - The Botswana Defence Force (BDF) has stopped the sale inside the Sir Seretse Khama Barracks of privately-owned newspaper, The Gazette. Speaking to MISA on June 11, the supermarket manager Stanley Chivanga confirmed he was ordered by the Barracks Protocol Office &quot;not take The Gazette.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chivanga, a civilian employee, said he was not given reasons for this order. The order to stop the sale, Chivanga said, was still standing and that he would not take later editions of The Gazette unless it was lifted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Gazette sells 100 copies to the Sir Seretse Khama Barracks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">June 4 edition of The Gazette reports the order followed a front page story of May 21 edition titled &quot;Is the BDF a family Business?&quot; The Gazette says it had reported on its front page that the BDF reacted angrily to queries by the newspaper that the army commander Lieutenant General Ian Khama was &quot;running the BDF like a family business&quot;. The paper reports its distribution vehicle was sent back with the May 28 edition of The Gazette for delivery at the Sir Seretse Khama Barracks Supermarket. The Gazette's circulation's officer, Philip Mokgethi, however, said the same edition of the Gazette was allowed at other BDF barracks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BDF Public Relations Officer, Captain Mogorosi Baatweng, told MISA June 6, he was not aware of any order to stop the paper from circulating in the said barracks. Baatweng, however, told MISA June 11, he was investigating the allegation. Meanwhile, Mokone told MISA on June 9 it was likely the barracks would not receive subsequent editions as he said the order to stop the sale had not been lifted. Mokone said he spoke, on June 6, to the supermarket manager Chivanga who told him he had not received orders to resume selling The Gazette. While the circulation's officer Mokgethi said he had not taken the June 10 edition to the Sir Seretse Khama Barracks Supermarket as he was still waiting for the order to be lifted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - A senior government official has accused two journalists from the state-run media of conspiring with opposition parties to impose a news blackout on government undertakings, reports the Zambia Independent Media Association, (ZIMA/MISA-Zambia).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZIMA says deputy permanent secretary in Zambia's Eastern Province, Lameck Chibombamilimo, laid the accusation on June 6, a day after the national radio and television failed to broadcast a story on the handing over of a donation of vehicles to the province. Chibombamilimo handed over the donation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sydney Chilambu, a journalists for Zambia News Agency (ZANA) and Tobias Phiri for Zambia Information Services (ZIS), told ZIMA June 9, that Chibombamilimo called them to his office on June 5, demanding to know why the story was not broadcast. The journalists further said, despite assuring Chibombamilimo that the story was filed for broadcasting, he was unsatisfied. He instead accused them of &quot;conniving with the opposition to blackout government stories&quot;. The two journalists are based in Eastern Zambia and file their stories to their central studios in the capital Lusaka, about a thousand kilometers away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to ZIMA June 10, Chibombamilimo admitted to having summoned the journalists to register his &quot;dissatisfaction,&quot; saying: &quot;I told them that developments in the province must be known, the people must know what the government is doing for them.... I asked them whose interests they were serving if such stories were not being published.&quot; he said, adding: &quot;I would not like people to frustrate my work, I want the people of Eastern Province, including journalists, to back me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chibombamilimo's accusation against the journalists has, however, riled the Civil Servants Union of Zambia (CSUZ), which has demanded an apology. &quot;The harassment of our members is unacceptable and Chibombamilimo should unreservedly apologise... for the unnecessary harassment,&quot; said CSUZ general secretary Japhet Moonde in a statement on June 10. And ZIMA chairperson David Simpson said the decision to publish or broadcast stories was vested in the editors, therefore, journalists should not be victimised if stories have not been used.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To impose sanctions against Nigeria, and for other purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES June 4, 1997 Mr. Payne (for himself, Mr. Houghton, Mr. Chabot, Ms. McKinney, Mr. Smith of New Jersey, Mr.  Faleomavaega, Mr. Lantos, Mr. Ackerman, Ms. Norton, Mr. Porter, Ms.  Pelosi, Ms. Waters, Mr. Brown of Ohio, Mr. Olver, Mr. Manton, Mr. Shays, Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, Ms. DeLauro, Mr. Filner, and Mr.  Clay) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on International Relations, and in addition to the Committees on Banking and Financial Services, Transportation and Infrastructure, and the Judiciary, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A BILL To impose sanctions against Nigeria, and for other purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Act may be cited as the &quot;Nigeria Democracy Act&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Congress makes the following findings:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) The November 10, 1995, execution by hanging of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni environmental activists was carried out by the Government of Nigeria after a trial that ignored the fundamental standards of legal process, and despite the pleas for clemency by the African and international community, as well as the United States Administration, the Chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives, and the Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus and the co-chairs of the Human Rights Caucus of the House of Representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) The United Nations recommended in both March and April of 1996 that the Government of Nigeria release the bodies of the Ogoni Nine for proper burial and paid compensation to the families of the deceased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(3) This heinous action followed an October 1, 1995, ambiguous statement by Nigerian military leader General Sani Abacha, that the country would be returned to civilian democratic rule in three years, and a lifting of the ban on political parties while at the same time not repealing the Treasonable Offenses Decree which allows the arrest of anyone speaking against the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(4) General Abacha&quot;s announcement was pressured by the outrage of the international community for his March 1995 arrest and conviction to long prison terms by secret trial of some 43 persons for involvement in a so- called coup. Among those convicted and still incarcerated are former President General Olusegun Obasanjo, the only military leader in Nigeria to return power to democratic civilian rule, General Shehu Musa Yar- Adua, deputy to the President in Abaasanjo&quot;s Administration, and later, human rights activist Beko Ransome-Kuti.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(5) The people of Nigeria and the international community had been led to believe that the presidential election held in Nigeria on June 12, 1993, would result in a return to full democratic civilian rule in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(6) General Ibrahim Babangida, the head of Nigeria&quot;s military government at the time of the June 12, 1993, election interrupted the release of the election results on June 23, 1993, and later annulled the election, thereby preventing a return to civilian rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(7) The election process indicated that voters in Nigeria--a country with a population of approximately 90,000,000 persons comprising 250 ethnic groups and spread across 357,000 square miles--were expressing a spirit of national unity that transcended ethnic, religious, and regional allegiances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(8) The reported returns suggested that Chief M.K.O. Abiola of the Social Democratic Party was receiving a substantial majority of the votes cast, leading the poll in 20 of the 30 States in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(9) The annulment of the presidential elections resulted in various forms of civil unrest, which in turn led to the deaths of more than 100 persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(10) An interim government established by General Babangida on August 27, 1993, and headed by Ernest Shonekan, failed to win the support of the Nigerian people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(11) General Sani Abacha took power on November 17, 1993, appointing an unelected Provisional Ruling Council to govern Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(12) Chief M.K.O. Abiola was imprisoned in solitary confinement for over one year for pressing his claim as the elected democratic leader of Nigeria, and still remains incarcerated today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(13) The political and economic conditions in Nigeria have continued to deteriorate in the months since Abacha took control of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(14) The faith of the Nigerian people in the viability of the nation as a unified whole must be preserved, and the balkanization of Nigeria guarded against.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(15) The people of Nigeria have not accepted the continuation of military rule and have courageously spoken out in favor of the rapid return of democratic and civilian rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(16) On May 15, 1994, a broad coalition of Nigerian democrats formed the National Democratic Coalition calling upon the military government to step down in favor of the winner of the June 12, 1993 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(17) The confidence of the Nigerian people and the international community in the Provisional Ruling Council&quot;s commitment to the restoration of democracy can only be established by a sustained demonstration of a commitment to human rights, due process, and the return of civilian rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(18) The United States would prefer to have a relationship with Nigeria based upon cooperation and mutual support but cannot, and will not, condone or overlook the denial of democratic civilian rule, against the clear wishes of the Nigerian people, by the Provisional Ruling Council or any other body in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(19) The lack of support from the Nigerian authorities on drug trafficking issues forced the United States for the last 2 years to place Nigeria on the list of countries penalized for failure to seriously address the narcotics proliferation issue, thus endangering vulnerable youth in our communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(20) Continuing credible reports of widespread corruption and questionable business practices in the Nigerian Government and &quot;scams&quot; in the United States, and the lack of cooperation in addressing these problems by the Nigerian Government, further undermines Nigeria&quot;s credibility in the international community, and is a constant embarrassment to approximately 1,000,000 law-abiding Nigerian Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(21) Nigeria&quot;s leadership role on the African continent, especially in the area of peacekeeping, will be severely compromised by its failure to rejoin the world community of democratic nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(22) Nigeria was recently suspended from the Commonwealth, a forum linking Britain and former colonies, and African countries like South Africa have already called for diplomatic, economic, and sports sanctions, since the limited sanctions imposed by the United States Administration have had little effect in safeguarding the lives of the people of Nigeria and moving Nigeria toward democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEC. 3. DECLARATIONS OF POLICY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(a) Commitment to Unity and Democracy by the Nigerian People.--The Congress continues to support the Nigerian people in their commitment to unity and democracy as evidenced by their participation in the June 12, 1993, presidential election in Nigeria, and in their subsequent insistence on the return to full civilian and democratic rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(b) Actions Taken by the United States.--While the Congress endorses the limited steps taken by the Administration to demonstrate United States opposition to the annulment of the June 12, 1993, presidential election in Nigeria, more needs to be accomplished to encourage the restoration of fully democratic and civilian rule in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(c) Sanctions to be Implemented in Coordination With International Community.--The Congress declares that the sanctions against Nigeria contained in this Act should be taken in concert with the international community and the United Nations to the maximum extent possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(d) Increase in Democracy Building and Rule of Law Assistance.--The Congress declares that the finite foreign assistance resources of the United States Government provided to Nigeria should be re-prioritized within present budget levels in order that more funds can be expended for democracy building and the promotion of the rule of law through nongovernmental organizations in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEC. 4. SANCTIONS AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF NIGERIA.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's budget speech has brought out in sharp relief realities faced by South Africans in the process of transformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The thrust of the speech is the need for a new patriotism among all our people irrespective of political affiliation if we are to transform our country into a truly non-racial, non-sexist and democratic South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It exposes the continued existence of pockets of silent mobilisation against change in our midst, reflected in the opposition to any measure that seeks to redress the imbalances of the past.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reality is that unless far-reaching and fundamental measures are undertaken by the democratic government, the sacrifices of millions of our people in bringing about the dawn of peace, freedom and justice would have been in vain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this regard, the mammoth challenge of fundamental transformation remains not only that of the democratic government alone but a responsibility of all sectors of society in the sprit of Masakhane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Key to this approach is the need for the continued mobilisation of the masses of our people, the custodians of our democracy, in all their formations and sectors, to defend their hard-won gains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attempts at undermining national patriotic efforts should not only be criticised but must be exposed. This extends to resistance to transformation of the health services, the rational implementation of the national crime-prevention strategy, restructuring of the civil service and improvement of people's socio-economic conditions. It includes attempts at suppressing the truth about the systematic gross human rights violations by the previous regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We reiterate our commitment to a clean, accountable and transparent government. It is in this context that for the first time South Africa has been exposed to the extent of graft in government, essentially a legacy of the system of apartheid. Yet the masterminds of that system and their apologists would want the public to believe that those responsible for exposing corruption are themselves corrupt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where there is corruption, the ANC in government will not hesitate to act to uproot it without fear of favour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC believes that all South Africans must embrace without equivocation sentiments expressed in Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's speech and actively contribute, in the spirit of reconciliation and a sense of new patriotism, to the transformation of our country, for the sake of all its people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The Lansdowne/Wetton corridor is beginning to take shape with the drafting of a five-year development scenario which colours in precincts earmarked for a host of uses ranging from light industrial to recreational.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The draft plan is the result of extensive interaction with communities and businesses in the area.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interested parties have until July 12 to comment on the proposals, summarised in map form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The details on the five-year plan include the development of a Sunset Junction precinct which would be a mix of light industrial, commercial and retail along Lansdowne Road. Linked to this are several other smaller areas, among them Gateways to Hanover Park and Manenberg and a precinct at Fezeka which would provide for housing and civic facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on the cards is a new station close to Lansdowne Road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Gough, who is co-ordinating the planning project on behalf of the Cape Town municipality, said the five-year development scenario was a draft plan which was being put out for comment, and further detail would be needed for specific developments. The focal points were a central area in the vicinity of Sunset Junction, and the Philippi East business district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Gough said perceptions around development in the area were changing rapidly with big developments being mooted for the Philippi area. One of the issues which needed addressing urgently was the installation of basic infrastructure which did not exist on the unserviced land.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - A deal due to be signed in Johannesburg today sees a black economic empowerment consortium, which includes Cape-based investment grouping Ukhozi, take control of City Press, South Africa's biggest black-read Sunday newspaper, from Afrikaans language media conglomerate Nasionale Pers (Naspers).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consortium also includes Durban-based Dynamo Investments, which is headed by former Inkatha Freedom Party secretary general Oscar Dhlomo and New Season's Investments, a company headed by former KaNgwane chief minister Enos Mabuza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consortium successfully negotiated the sale for a 51% stake in City Press last month and will sign the deal today. The stake was bought for R110 million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ukhozi will own 10% of City Press, with 20% going to Dynamo and 10% to New Season's. A total of 6% of the shares will be made available to City Press' staff and the remaining 5% to the newspaper's distributors.  Naspers will retain a 49% stake in the newspaper, which has a weekly circulation of 250 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ukhozi managing director Lizo Ngcokoto said that as a result of the group's involvement in the acquisition he hoped that City Press would carry &quot;newsworthy issues relevant to the people of the Cape&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;City Press needs to make inroads into the Cape in a serious fashion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through the deal the consortium has also secured the pre-emptive rights to buy Drum and True Love magazines if Naspers should decide to sell them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ngcokoto said the consortium intended developing City Press into a formidable competitor to top-selling Sunday newspaper rivals the Sunday Times and Rapport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At this stage we are content with the acquisition of the newspaper but at the appropriate time we will approach Naspers about buying the magazines,&quot; Mr Ngcokoto said when asked whether the consortium had any immediate plans to buy Drum and True Love.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new shareholders must decide about buying the magazines,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ngcokoto said funds were raised through a major South African institution. He declined to name the bank or give details of the financial mechanism.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - South Africa has confirmed that it is willing to serve as a neutral venue for the trial of two Libyans accused of being behind the 1988 bombing of an airliner over Lockerbie in Scotland</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given Libya's isolated and controversial position in the world - the United Nations Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on the country because of its refusal to surrender for trial two men accused of being responsible for an explosion on board a Pan American jumbo jet over Lockerbie in Scotland in 1988 - any country entering into a new agreement with the regime of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi could engender some measure of international disapproval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But judging from the remarks made by Libyan Foreign Minister Omar Muntasser when he signed a co-operation agreement in Pretoria this week, there is a new eagerness in Tripoli to see the Lockerbie issue settled once and for all and for sanctions against Libya to be lifted. This presents the South African Government with a unique opportunity to help bridge the chasm which now separates Libya from much of the rest of the international community.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo remarked this week that South Africa supported Libya's insistence on a neutral venue for the trial of the two Libyans accused of having been behind the Lockerbie bombing and a government spokesman confirmed yesterday that, if approached, South Africa would be willing to provide such a venue. This could be the catalyst in bringing about a reconciliation between major Western countries and an economically and strategically important country in Africa - a development which would be of undoubted benefit to the continent and the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African Government has demonstrated its skill at helping to resolve seemingly intractable diplomatic and political disputes and it should take the initiative in attempting to bring to a conclusion the longstanding tragedy of the Lockerbie bombing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The Congress of SA Trade Unions' (Cosatu) one-day general strike has come and gone, but questions about the federation's true motives for the action linger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers have asked whether Cosatu is fighting against provisions in the Basic Conditions of Employment Draft Bill or pressing its ruling alliance partner, the African National Congress (ANC), to renegotiate its Growth, Employment and Redistribution (Gear) strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The federation's parliamentary officer, Neil Coleman, says the strike can be seen as a protest against the ANC Government's shift in economic policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To the extent that the elements of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act is based on the prescriptions of Gear - to undermine protection for the vulnerable, rather than extending them basic rights - then I suppose our strike on Monday is also against Gear,&quot; Mr Coleman told a meeting two weekends ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't need to apologise for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it was legitimate for Cosatu to protest against Gear, because the strategy represented a fundamental shift in economic policy from that outlined in the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosatu was the main architect of the RDP policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Gear strategy,unveiled last year, among other things emphasises labour market flexibility and stringent control over the budget deficit by reducing it to three percent by 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strategy also envisages the creation of a million jobs and a six percent economic growth rate by the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Cosatu says the Gear policy will lead to job losses and has asked the Government to renegotiate the strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mandela consistently has maintained that Gear is not negotiable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has said that his government would not be held to ransom in its efforts to improve people's lives by a small group within South African society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosatu said it went on strike to protest at the non-inclusion of six months' maternity leave, with four months paid, and a 40-hour week, which would be phased in over five years, on the draft bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour law expert Gavin Brown, however, has told the Cape Argus that Cosatu was deceiving the public by making out as if it had a dispute with the business sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This disagreement is simply a mask for a much bigger dispute between Cosatu and the Government,&quot; said Mr Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the strike was used by Cosatu to tell the Government they were not happy with Gear and that the federation needed more say in formulating economic policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a mistake to see this as a dispute between Cosatu and business,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, in spite of Mr Brown's assertion, the Department of Labour has chosen to send out different signals about its response to the dispute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour Minister Tito Mboweni told Business Argus that legislating a 40-hour working week, to which he had committed himself in the past, was still a priority of the Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said Cosatu's 40-hour week demand could not be implemented in one stroke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 40-hour week is a historical demand of the working class,&quot; said Mr Mboweni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whatever I think on a personal level, I don't work alone. I don't determine what market conditions are,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday's strike was the third national stoppage since the 1994 elections which brought President Mandela's government to power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That there have been problems between Cosatu and the SA Communist Party, on the one hand, and the ANC on the other, is an open secret that appears to have strained relations in the alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At issue has been the Government's economic policies and the pace of delivering essential relief to disadvantaged communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The secretaries of the Western Cape region of Cosatu and SACP, Tony Ehrenreich and Phillip Dexter respectively, openly admitted this during a National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union meeting last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extent of the odds at which the alliance partners are, was demonstrated by the fact that the SACP fully supported the strike and hardly a whisper was heard from the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During Cosatu's march to Parliament last week, ANC leaders were notable by their absence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SACP went further and publicly chastised the ANC in a statement and said it had abandoned its constituency which consisted mainly of the poor and the working class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The SACP expresses its solidarity and support for the Cosatu 24-hour strike tomorrow,&quot; the party's central committee said in the statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All attempts to block workplace democratisation in the name of competitiveness, flexibility or growth must be resisted,&quot; it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of the reported problems in the alliance, Cosatu secretary- general Sam Shilowa has denied an impending break-up of relations among the partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The alliance is united on the need to eradicate apartheid at the workplace and to extend worker rights and conditions that have systematically been denied over many years of oppression and exploitation,&quot; said Mr Shilowa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the apparent damage the disagreements have done to the alliance, Cosatu has stood its ground and threatened another strike if business does not accept its point of view on the draft bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they want to take a hard line, this is not a one-way street.  We'll also take a hard line to challenge them,&quot; Mr Shilowa has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they have nerves to continue the argument around workers' basic rights we will use our steel nerves to fight them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debate over the draft bill has, however, taken an unexpected turn with the employer organisation, Business South Africa (BSA), saying last week that negotiations on the bill should be suspended until after the presidential job summit set for October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BSA deputy president Leslie Boyd has said business was concerned that some aspects of the draft bill could have a bearing of the summit and therefore slow job creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources close to Cosatu have told the Cape Argus that the federation had expected business to take a hard line against the federation demands and did not expect a proposal to stall the negotiations until the job summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sources said Cosatu would hold an executive committee meeting later this month to formulate a response to business's proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the outcome of the Cosatu executive committee meeting on June 24, or business' response to the federation demands, one question that begs answering is how much hammering the South African economy can take, while parties settle old scores.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - A top secret document sent to the State Security Council on the first day of the three-day &quot;witdoeke&quot; attack on the KTC squatter camp asked for R3 000 for a &quot;victory feast&quot; for the witdoeke in the form of a ritual cattle slaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document, dated June 9 1986, was sent from the Western Province Joint Management Committee (JMC) - the regional structure of the shadowy, nationwide security system of the former government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It continued: &quot;Finality, however, will not be reached before June 11 1986, when we will be in contact again.&quot; By that date, several thousand shacks in KTC had been razed and an estimated 60 000 of its residents were refugees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document was one of several &quot;top secret&quot; and &quot;secret&quot; communications between the State Security Council and regional security structures which were submitted to the Truth Commission yesterday on the final day of its three-day &quot;special event&quot; hearing focusing on violence in informal settlements in the Peninsula in 1985/86.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May and June 1986, KTC and three satellite squatter camps were attacked by witdoeke - also known as &quot;fathers&quot; or the conservatives - who were mostly from Crossroads and who owed allegiance to conservative leaders such as Crossroads mayor Johnson Ngxobongwana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police and other state officials have consistently denied colluding with the witdoeke in the attacks - also in their testimony during a Supreme Court action for damages by homeless squatters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some truth commissioners and a member of the commission's human rights violations committee said the secret documents provided clear evidence that the state had been directly involved in the conflict, which cost at least 57 lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Mapule Ramashala said the June 9 document referred to a specific celebration anticipating victory for the witdoeke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It places the hand of the state right squarely in the middle of it (the conflict) This document in fact confirms complicity (in) the annihilation of the satellites, including KTC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Dumisa Ntsebeza, who heads the commission's investigative unit, commented afterwards: &quot;It is quite clear in my mind that there was that kind of involvement by the State Security Council.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela, a member of the commission's human rights violations committee who organised the KTC hearing, said both the documents and the forthright testimony by former Crossroads town clerk Ricky Shelhase yesterday had indicated that the state had been trying to create &quot;a kind of bantustan&quot; at Crossroads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is very clear that the government was manipulating the violence, setting up the two groups (&quot;comrades&quot; and &quot;witdoeke&quot;) and then pulling back so that it seemed like a war.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Western Cape Police Minister Gerald Morkel has warned criminals there will be an all-out war on their activities now that big business has joined the fight against crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the launch of the Business Against Crime initiative at a Green Point hotel last night, Mr Morkel said the partnership between the police and the business sector was necessary to stop crime.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the first time organised business at the highest level has officially accepted that they have a vital role to play in this war we are fighting against criminals. These businessmen bring with them the expertise and skills which in conjunction with our police service must effectively fight crime,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prominent banker Mike Thompson, who was elected chairman of the initiative, said the time had come for the streets of Cape Town to reflect what most of its citizens wanted - safety and peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A four-pronged &quot;attack&quot; which had already been implemented in Gauteng, KwaZulu Natal and the Eastern Cape would now be launched in the Western Cape, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This four-pronged strategy will include fighting crime, researching and advising the government on legislative measures and developing initiatives to secure economic upliftment and community rehabilitation,&quot; said Mr Thompson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Thompson said that although they had the overwhelming support of the bid company and many of their objectives were the same as those of Chris Ball's team, the initiative was in response to President Mandela's plea that business play its part in fighting crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Daniel from His People Church in Rondebosch, who was elected to handle the portfolio on community rehabilitation, said crime transcended religious and ideological differences. &quot;The goal is crime rehabilitation and we will be working right from grassroots up to the prisons in the Western Cape.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - South Africa's success in helping to resolve international disputes may soon be followed by an effort to get United Nations sanctions against Libya lifted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This could be done by South Africa offering to provide a neutral venue for the trial of two Libyans accused of the 1988 bombing of an American airliner over Lockerbie in Scotland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Department of Foreign Affairs spokesman confirmed yesterday that, if approached, South Africa would be willing to provide such a venue.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This follows the signing in Pretoria earlier this week of a co- operation agreement with Libya, and South Africa's initiatives in resolving disputes in Zaire, Angola, Mozambique and Northern Ireland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the signing of the agreement Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo and Libyan Foreign Minister Omar Mustafa Muntasser both referred to the Lockerbie bombing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 250 people were killed when a Pan American jumbo jet exploded over the Scottish village of Lockerbie while en route to New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libya, which has been sheltering the two men suspecting of being behind the bombing, has refused to hand them over for trial in either Britain or the United States, instead insisting on a neutral venue. The United Nations Security Council responded by unanimously imposing wide- ranging sanctions on Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Muntasser said this week that Libya was offering South Africa access to its crude oil - something specifically banned by UN sanctions - and said Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi could visit South Africa by the end of this year &quot;if sanctions are lifted&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under UN sanctions no country may assist in the flight of airliners to or from Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa supports an Organisation of African Unity resolution which backed Libya's call for a neutral venue for a trial of the Libyan suspects under Scottish law and with Scottish judges presiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, The Hague - seat of the International Court of Justice - was suggested as a trial venue but this was rejected by the US. The constitution of the World Court does not allow it to hear criminal cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Affairs spokesman Pieter Swanepoel yesterday denied speculation in diplomatic circles that South Africa had already offered a trial venue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he confirmed that South Africa was willing to provide a neutral venue if asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the US embassy in Pretoria said that to the best of his knowledge there had been no communication between the South African government and Washington about such an offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US had consistently asked Libya to comply with a 1991 UN resolution that the suspects should be handed over for trial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - It is difficult to categorise Daniel Silke. Too practical to be just an academic, too academic to be just a political dilettante and too honest-looking to be just a politician, he is a bit of all these and perhaps more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A political analyst is how he would probably be described, one who has lectured on South Africa at universities, colleges, schools and think-tanks overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Explaining South Africa to the world has become my business,&quot; says Silke, whose academic background is in politics and political philosophy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I have also knocked on doors and campaigned and listened to people's problems in their homes (he stood as a candidate in the ward of Woodstock in the 1994 election).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's all very well to study politics in its academic form ... but frankly, there's a different world on the street, and the experience I gained from being a political candidate was probably one of the more humbling experiences of my life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Silke has just returned from a cruise on board the Crystal Symphony, lecturing on South African politics (he lectured on two other cruise ships previously).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He tells me that he enjoys the interaction with the cruise passengers, and it's not difficult to see why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A devoted Democratic Party member, newly elected city councillor and ardent protagonist of liberal values, Silke talks easily and is easy to talk to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is an insatiable interest in South Africa overseas, and everywhere this country is regarded as having made a successful transition from minority government to a multiparty democracy, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a standard three-course lecture series that I offer cruise companies - it is an introduction to South African politics ... there is a bit of history about the development of apartheid, a bit about contemporary South Africa and the new constitution, and then some crystal-ball gazing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last part draws the most response and is also a lot of fun, says Silke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, everyone is their own political analyst and their own political fortune-teller, and the fun is to see whether my predictions tally with yours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He laughs when asked whether he would like to share some of his predictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the questions I am asked most often, and not surprisingly, is about a South Africa without Mandela.Will the country be able to hold together and not disintegrate into chaos and anarchy?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that the African National Congress will in all likelihood be the majority party after 1999, we will probably see a fairly smooth transition to a new ANC leadership, he predicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If (our new leader ) is to be (Thabo) Mbeki, I think we are going to see a smooth seamless move towards an Mbeki presidency which will have different characteristics to that of Mandela.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our biggest problems and &quot;critical issues&quot; are going to be economic growth and the development of a free market policy that encourages foreign investment, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the omnipresent subject of crime, he worries that apart from the physical threat which affects &quot;every person in South Africa on a daily basis&quot;, far worse is a process which demoralises &quot;young and upwardly mobile South Africans who are able to emigrate&quot; and causes people to withdraw from the community and to &quot;bury their heads in the sand&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is too much focus on emigration prospects and too little devoted to constructive work within our own communities&quot; says Silke, who advocates that young people &quot;become involved, as participation leads to major rewards&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one can accuse him of not practising what he preaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He serves on a local police forum, which he says helps him to better understand the problem of crime and &quot;gives me encouragement and a degree of control&quot; over the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently elected as chairman of the Association of Liberal Democratic Councillors of South Africa, he claims that this country &quot;desperately needs to apply liberal philosophies to governance&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My interest in liberal politics began when I was about 13 when I joined the then Progressive Federal Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More than half of my life (he is now 32) has been spent attached to one political party and working and actively campaigning for that party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is currently branch chairman of the Democratic Party in the Atlantic suburbs area and serves on various party bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is convinced that South Africa needs a resurgence of liberal values and a move away from ethnically based politics if it is to survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to promote the individual as the cornerstone of society...  that's something that is very important for me - the right to be an individual, the right to think what I want to, the right to dissent (very important in South Africa) and these go hand in hand with the free market economic policy, controlled privatisation and with preserving multiparty democracy in South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This assessment comes today from Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela, a member of the Truth Commission's human rights violations committee, after viewing photographs given to the Cape Argus by a Mitchell's Plain man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man, whose moral conscience was fired by the TRC's &quot;special event&quot; hearing this week into violence in the Peninsula's informal settlements in 1985 and 1986, said the photographs were taken in KTC while it was being destroyed by &quot;witdoeke&quot; (conservatives) in 1986.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man, a rigger by trade, acquired a set of photographs from a friend who worked at a picture processing business. They appear to have been taken by a policeman or soldier during the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pictures, nearly all of which are too gruesome to publish, show victims who have been hacked to death with sharp instruments and &quot;necklace&quot; victims - some reduced to charred bones and others still alight. Other pictures show securityforce members with several bodies on the ground next to them and victims with hack wounds being taken to an ambulance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the worst shows three policemen, armed with shotguns, clearly posing hunter-style with their &quot;trophy&quot;, the body of a black man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Truth Commission staff who were given a brief glimpse of some of the pictures yesterday said they did appear to have been taken around KTC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man, who gave the Cape Argus his name, contacted the newspaper this week. He said he had no problem with giving all his particulars to the TRC and asked to be put in touch with its investigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cape Argus today handed enlargements of some of the photographs to Truth Commissioner Dumisa Ntsebeza, who said the photographs would be useful - &quot;especially because we are looking at expanding (our evidence) on the State Security Council connection with violence in the area&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Gobodo-Madikizela said similar pictures had been presented at the inquiry earlier this year into the deaths of the so-called &quot;Guguletu Seven&quot;, shot dead by police in 1985.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The photograph of the three policemen &quot;demonstrates very clearly the brutality of the police, and the animalisation of black bodies that was so common at the time&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It reflects the attitude of the police at the time, so it adds a very important dimension to our understanding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the photographs had been taken in KTC/Crossroads, they would be of use in the commission's inquiry, she added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chiluba said perpetrators of violence should have waited to be democratically elected instead of resorting to violence as a way of coming to power.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the issue of violence in Congo was disturbing especially that it came at a time when the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) was calling for peace in Africa for it to develop.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, President Chiluba said Africa should strive to have governments founded on democracy where the stakeholders were involved in the running of the countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chiluba said Africa has numerous problems like international debt servicing which required consented efforts of all citizens to try and find resources to service the huge debts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Embattled University of Zambia (Unza) vice chancellor Andrew Siwela has maintained his administration currently facing charges of embezzlement and mismanagement is clean and dismissed the allegations as blatant lies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Siwela, leading a delegation which included his deputy Jorry Mwenechanya, registrar Michael Tandeo and bursar Mafukeni Tembo also heaped the blame on Government for the ungovernable state of the campus because of its non-committal stance towards serious issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof Siwela, 50, Mwenechanya, Tandeo and Tembo all 41, appeared jointly before the Bobby Bwalya Commission of Inquiry yesterday and said most of the allegations could be substantiated with supporting documents but striking university workers had denied them access to their offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two professors, Siwela and Mwenechanya said their controversial 25 per cent shares in Zamnet Communications System were held in trust because the two had a primary objective to ensure quality service to academics.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that by virtue of being a board member Health Minister Katele Kalumba was offered 12.5 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They named other board members as the director of the computer centre, former Zamtel managing director Swathulani Munthali, Siwela, Mwenechanya, the registrar and bursar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said in submissions which took a whole day the relationship between Zamnet and the university was strictly business as evidenced by the rent collected from Zamnet and Unza subscriptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the alleged disappearance of dividends from York Farm, Prof Siwela confirmed management claimed an amount of K654m and were proposing to council to use the money to liquidate a $2.2m Government loan obtained to buy the farm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Unza partners Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) held 17 per cent in shares and that after injection of $4.1m into operations CDC's shareholding would increase to 51 and Unza 49 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However a manager a Mr Youngson was being paid $25,000 per month to run the farm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Tembo said it was justifiable for the institution to hold numerous accounts considering it handled amounts close K14.5bn and maintained the accounts were currently 36 and not 48.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the K45m was paid to Carpet Centre Travel agency to clear a debt of K56m owed in air tickets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof Siwela said all the allegations levelled against him which included an aborted trip to Livingstone in which he received K7m and Ghana, were lies and aimed at destroying his personal reputation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am being called a thief and blasted left, right and centre but these allegations are all lies. And all this information is filtering to the international audience through Internet. This is a perfect recipe to destroy an academic institution,&quot; Prof Siwela said with a quiver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pleaded with chairman Bwalya to protect management against further humiliation from unruly workers who seemed to disrespect the commission's existence by denying the principal officers access to their offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that Government should urgently review the Health Services Act to recognise the University Teaching Hospital as a centre for medical training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Tembo recommended that Government should without delay establish a loans and scholarships board which should be a semi-autonomous to institute a more sustainable mode of student funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On student welfare, Mr Tandeo said to decongest the university, expansion of distant education should be promoted while some existing higher education institutions should be transformed to offer university programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mwenechanya said to improve the working atmosphere at the institution Government should urgently consider the proposed scheme for the sale of houses to staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Government's delay to respond had resulted in mistrust of management by staff thus lowering their working morale Prof Siwela defended Health Deputy Minister Nkandu Luo for continuing to teach despite resigning to pursue politics as she did so because of the acute shortage of lecturers adding that pathology head of department Dr Cecilia Shinondo should have been more diplomatic on the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Management said Government lent a deaf ear to their requests citing that salary negotiations for all category of staff had stalled because Government had not furnished them with the negotiation sealing causing anxieties among workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government had not approved a university home ownership scheme, strategic plan 2001 and was dilly-dallying over student finance review resulting in student unrest and bursaries owing the institution about K454m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof Siwela charged that the ministry was leaking documents to staff and students and said the permanent secretary had alienated the institution by not attending Unza council sittings on which he was member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the leaking of documents was the source of the last week's strike by general workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During questions, the commissioners demanded to know why the librarian had been sidelined yet in the Act stipulated he was a principal officer to which Prof Siwela replied, the office had nothing to offer to central management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said historically the office had been excluded from management and said the librarian was only complaining because he envied the fringe benefits other principal officers like the vice chancellor enjoyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Quite frankly I do not see what he (the librarian) can contribute to central administration. His job is just to manage a unit,&quot; Justice Bwalya adjourned the submissions to today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a former secretary to the bursaries committee said problems at Unza and Copperbelt University (CBU) could have been avoided if the two vice-chancellors had time for members of staff and students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Patson Simwawa said in a written submission to the Unza/CBU Commission of Inquiry that during his tenure he observed that the two vice-chancellors had no time to attend to students and staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most often senior staff were not consulted over important issues leaving them to discover only through the Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He lamented that administration had a tendency to dissociate itself from student funding claiming that it was strictly between the sponsors and sponsored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said this was wrong as when disruption of studies occurred because of non-payment or delayed allowances administration was quick to move in and close the institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Simwawa also blamed Government for making contact with students only when there was a crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ministry of Education should be more open and always tell the truth.  They should not act under pressure and only in a crisis as is always the case,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The striking workers at the university of Zambia Great East Road campus in Lusaka have acted irrationally by persisting with the strike in which they are demanding the removal of the entire administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is strange that while a Government appointed commission of inquiry is gathering evidence on the problems of the institution and that of the Copperbelt University, the employees have elected to go on strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among their demands include the call to President Chiluba to intervene in the crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is President Chiluba who appointed the current commission of inquiry that is probing the problems of the university, how else would they want the matter resolved? We feel that workers have taken the matter too far. If they have a case at all it is positive to allow the current commission to finish its task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demanding the removal of an administration using rather unorthodox means is not the humane way of resolving issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by appointing the commission of inquiry Government recognised that there was a problem at Unza that needed a lasting solution. We do not think the Unza workers will achieve anything by trying to use short cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We feel that by insisting with the strike the employees are creating a crisis where there is none. Making the institution ungovernable at the moment is no solution in anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact after the employees blocked management from going into offices police should have moved in to restore order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether or not the workers have a case, there is no excuse in resorting to hooliganism. Moreover the current arbitrator over the Unza saga is the commission of inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workers are still free to go and testify, otherwise the most positive thing to do now is to call off the strike and allow management officials that have been barred to go to the offices and begin work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unza has enough problems without creating any more. The continued strike will delay progress being made on the efforts to seek solutions on the issues there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already a lot has been lost by the continued closure of the institution. It is with this in mind we appeal to the University of Zambia Workers Union (Unzawu) to restrain its militant members and advise them that there is a more rational way to seek a solution to the problem at Unza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union should entice members to do one thing sensible; call off the strike and allow sanity to return to the campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unrealistic demands are not just hollow but will retard progress made and just delay the reopening of the university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the moment the strike is unjustified the earlier it is called off the better. Enough damage has bee caused to the institution the intergrity of its administrators and the workers too.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Zambia's Commonwealth heavyweight hopeful Joseph Chingangu leaves for London tonight for next Tuesday's crack at the 'club' title against Briton Julius Francis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boxing Board of Control (BBC) chairman Hilary Matyola who confirmed the departure in Lusaka yesterday, said Chingangu flies out with his trainer Mike Zulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matyola said Chingangu, whose camp received two tickets from British promoter Frank Maloney on Tuesday, was ready for the 12-rounder set for Grondy Park Chesnont.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chingangu, whom I've seen train, is more than ready for the fight.  We hope that he wins so that he gives the Zambians something to cheer about after last weekend's soccer debacle in South Africa,&quot; Matyola said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BBC chief said the new Sport, Youth and Child Development Permanent Secretary Gerald Nyirenda who flies to London on business on Saturday would watch the fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chingangu, the Iron Nkhoma Promotions boxer, has been in intensive training at Evelyn Hone college gymnasium in Lusaka for about a month under Zulu and Alpha Kasonde.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambian heavyweight boxer-who out of his 17 professional fights has won 15, 12 of which were knock outs and lost two- admitting that he knew nothing about his opponent, said he was ready for the fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am ready for the fight as I am set to make a new beginning in my career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The junior IBF title I won last year was just there to fool me into believing I was a world champion I never was,&quot; Chingangu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chingangu and Francis were chosen from 13 top contenders, who included Lenox Lewis, to fight for the title which fell vacant after British boxer Scott Welch failed to defend it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chingangu is the second Zambian after light welterweight Felix Bwalya, who lost on points, to fight for the 'Club' title in two months.  In his last fight, Chingangu knocked out Zimbabwean Anderson Saizi in the second round last December.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Power (1) 3 Wanderers (0) 1 MUFULIRA Wanderers loss to Power Dynamos in Kitwe yesterday, the league champion's fifth consecutive defeat left more questions than answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is everything alright at Wanderers? Wanderers were disappointing, disjointed in all departments and their supporters were left admiring the swift Power side extend their lead at the top of the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not even the inclusion of internationals Paul Chellah and Nelson Banda could redeem Wanderers who allowed Power to dominate the afternoon earlier thought would be used to open a new leaf.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wanderers who have not won a game since losing to Zamalek in the African Club champions league match two months ago, only helped Power extend their unbeaten run and points tally to 23 in nine outings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Veteran Linos Makwaza's header in the 20th minute sent Wanderers on the slippery road to defeat before Peter Chitila and Douglas Chiwaya sealed the victory in the 73rd and 89th minutes respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wanderer's face saver came through substitute Boscher Chibwe who caught Power goalkeeper Pelewe Delamogo off guard in the 80th.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chibwe, relatively unknown, had come in for another recruit Leo Mukwasa at change ends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wanderers goalkeeper Collins Mbulo was sent off after a crude tackle on Simon Mwansa in the box which earned Power a penalty neatly tacked away by Chitila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbulo's departure left Wanderers one man down after referee John Commander of Luanshya who ruled the foul constituted dangerous play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Wanderers bench could not hide their anxiety and quickly sacrificed Banda to infuse in reserve goalkeeper Charles Mwila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwila was later to concede two goals as Wanderers slipped to defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Peter Kaumba, the Power trainer was expressing happiness, Wanderers coach George Lwandamina said the loss was very painful and unfortunate because the players were playing like were protesting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources said the Wanderers executive held a meeting with players at which Lwandamina was top on the agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fans trooped out of stadium wandering what had befallen their team.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Laughter Chilembi equalised four minutes later, sending the match into an exciting climax as both teams fought head on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zamsure however shrugged off a Rangers challenge and took the lead in the 39th through defender Kingsley Ntosha and they were not so lucky when their foe Daddley Fichite split the points in the 46th minute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - British Airways (BA) has changed its corporate identity as part of the *1bn investment in new services, aircraft, facilities and training in the next three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BA displayed its new image in Zimbabwe, London, New York, Dubai, Bombay, Bangkok, Australia, France, Germany and Hong Kong on Tuesday, June 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The launch of the new concept of the company, dubbed &quot;painting the skies&quot; was centred on donning of its aircrafts' tails in colours and designs derived from different destination countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New paint technologies, new processes and advanced technology have been harnessed by a team of 36 BA engineering paint technicians to convert the original designs from sketchpad to the skies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the core of the new identity is the use of the original world images, which have been applied to the tails of 308 aircraft in the BA fleet. The aim is to represent BA as a community passionately committed to serving the communities of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The launch in Africa was characterised by pomp and splendour at Victoria Falls town in Zimbabwe where a BA aircraft painted with a Japanese design was flown over the Victoria Falls which is shared with Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimbabwe event coincided with the unveiling of the recently announced Comair service. In London the event involved unveiling of newly painted aircraft at Heathrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BA chief executive, Bob Ayling, noted that the world was getting smaller, technology was changing the way people communicated and competition was getting tougher but most important of all was that expectations of customers had changed and so BA had to change its identity accordingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the *6bn investment for the next three years, 43 new aircraft would join the airline's fleet including 29 Boeing 747-400s, nine 777 and five 757s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of millions of pounds would be spent during this period on new services and products, new routes, a new approach to customer service and new ways of working with employees, all aimed at providing better levels of service.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Zambia's total export earnings last year plummeted by 19.5 per cent and Government has been urged to get out of its slumber and help draw strategies for the business community to flood the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) with Zambian goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speakers at the Economics Association of Zambia (EAZ) monthly discussion decried that Zambia always lagged behind in exploiting export opportunities to markets where the country had great advantages such as Congo-Kinshasa had become after the political changes there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1995 Zambia's total export earnings including copper and cobalt amounted to $1,237,980,000 but this fell to $996,755,022. The decline was attributed to the decline in production of copper and cobalt.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Export Board of Zambia (EBZ) director, Mutale Musonda, said the DRC was Zambia's single largest market in the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa) region with 37 per cent of total non- traditional exports (NTEs) going to that country in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DRC was followed by Zimbabwe at 29 per cent. There was urgent need for the Zambian Government to conclude bilateral trade agreements with the DRC to ensure a firm grip on the Congo-Kinshasa market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other countries with which Zambia must conclude bilateral trade agreements are South Africa and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out of total NTE earnings of $242,555,022 the Comesa region represented $88,241,985 of which the DRC was highest at $32,848,092 compared to Zimbabwe's $25,479,845.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The DRC is currently Zambia's largest single market. The potential that the market presents is far from exhausted and the onus is on Zambian business to attack the market much more aggressively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To improve trade relations with the DRC it would be extremely useful and beneficial for Zambia if a bilateral trade agreement were entered into as soon as possible,&quot; Mr Musonda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (ZACCI) chief executive, Gideon Phiri, echoed Mr Musonda's sentiments and warned that Zambia was not ready at present to exploit its full potential in the Congo market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa, Zimbabwe and Mozambique were now looking north and Zambia must move fast to dominate the DRC market but Government must lead the way by putting in place the vital trade agreement for business to take over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rich Shaba province of the DRC has a population of nine million people and that was a huge market for Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was need for establishment of a Zambian bank in Lubumbashi to facilitate financial transactions, business people must build factories and warehouses close to the border with Shaba province of the DRC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alex Mwanakasale from the Zambia National Farmers Union (ZNUF) said 70 per cent of Zambia's exports to the DRC comprised agricultural products including maize, mealie meal, cotton lint, eggs, chickens, chicks, stockfeeds, beef, potatoes, sugar and onions. The exports go to Shaba province which has a population of nine million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out of the $32.8m worth of exports to DRC in 1996, $25m or 76 per cent were agricultural products : Sugar $16.6m, maize $6.6m, mealie meal $0.98m and other products $0.9m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government must ensure that it hammers out customs formalities with its DRC counterpart for standard business to flourish between the two countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The 24 per cent fuel hike effected yesterday will distort the Zambian economy which was cementing its stability, the Economics Association of Zambia (EAZ) has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EAZ believes the National Oil Company's (NOC's) reasons for the increase were not convincing, taking into account that economic indicators were reflecting stability.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The monthly inflation rate running below 25 per cent last month, and exchange rates having been stable were signs of an improved economic performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EAZ chief executive Amos Nakalonga said in Lusaka yesterday that the NOC could be unduly spreading their operational problems to the ordinary citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is unfair for National Oil Company to start spreading its own problems to the ordinary Zambians. The cost of living has already been too high in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is likely to distort the general economic performance of Zambia because the hike is too high. We have not seen a fuel increase of this much before,&quot; Mr Nakalonga said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The factories would be equally affected because the cost of production automatically goes up and therefore, their products would be more expensive. Fuel was a major input in any process of production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Personally, I think the increase is unjustifiable. The company has been pouring money inTO sports, creating problems for itself. And now they want to use the public to offset their losses. It's disgusting,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NOC increased prices of all petroleum products by 24 per cent, attributing it to the upward adjustment of refining and pumping rates by Indeni Petroleum Refinery and Tazama Pipelines to cater for capital maitntenance costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NOC claimed the petroleum price adjustments had not been reflecting the obtaining international prices and costs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - Uganda's economic growth dropped to 5 percent this fiscal year from 6.5 in the 1995-96 period, the country's Finance Minister Jehoash Mayanja Nkangi announced in Kampala on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his budget speech read in parliament, Nkangi blamed the decline on drought and the cassava mosaic virus, which led to food shortages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayanja Nkangi said the average rate of inflation for 1996/97 was expected to be around 7.5 percent, up from 6 percent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the minister expects the economic growth for next fiscal year to be 7 per cent and inflation 5 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his speech, exerpts of which reached PANA on Friday, the minister announced a stringent budget in which he slashed government expenditure by an average of 23 percent from last year's actual expenditure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall internally funded government expenditure is budgeted to be 922 billion Uganda shillings, a drop from 1,203 billion spent during the 1996/97 fiscal year (excluding taxes paid by the government). (1 USD=1000 U sh)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also froze wage increases for civil servants and vowed not to allow supplementary expenditure during the new financial year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister also attributed to the drop in economic growth to unusually heavy rains in Western Uganda and the low coffee prices for the I996/97 season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were no major tax increases except a 20 percent increase on vehicle licence fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayanja Nkangi announced modest reduction of about 10 percent in fuel duty, petrol to 215 percent and the diesel and paraffin to 160 percent and 105 percent respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said this has been done to check smuggling of petrol products into the country. Excise duties on soft drinks were reduced by 20 percent to 30 percent and beer by five percent to 65 percent. Value Added Tax (VAT) remains almost the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maximum import duty was reduced from 30 percent to 20 percent. Excise surcharges on imports will be harmonised at 10 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister also proposed amendments to the Investment Code, abolishing tax holidays and introducing a low uniform corporation tax rate of 30 percent with generous depreciation provisions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The united Nations World Food Programme (WFP) says it expects to start Friday a limited relief food distribution in Sierra Leone, where the army seized power on May 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A WFP news release received by PANA here on Friday said the operation will be targeted at tens of thousands vulnerable people in Freetown and other urban centres like Kenema, Bo and Makeni, most of whom are in hospitals, clinics, orphanages and schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of these people were being assisted by WFP before the current conflict, but thousands more have recently arrival in the centres in need of help.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Security permitting, various WFP commodities will be distributed tomorrow through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), plus NGOs and community groups who are still able to operate in Sierra Leone,&quot; the release said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most foreign agencies, including those of the UN have been forced to withdraw their personnel from the war-ravaged Freetown because of insecurity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the Sierra Leonean army seized power from the elected President Hamad Tejan Kabbah, the price of staple foods has doubled, and supplies of imports such as rice, sugar and flour are dwindling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kerosene and petrol are also in short supply and it is expected that many essential products such as fuel and rice will run out within two weeks,&quot; said the WFP release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP is also making preparations for rural areas of Sierra Leone where people affected by the conflict may decide to leave their home and trek into neighbouring countries or other locations within their country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are rushing relief food stocks to Conakry (Guinea) and San Pedro (Cote d'Ivoire) in case we suddenly start to see large refugee movements, &quot; the news release quoted Jamie Wickens, WFP's regional manager for West Africa, as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We may launch a cross-border operation from those countries to feed internally displaced people, and curb the flow of those who might decide to seek asylum in neighbouring countries&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN food distribution agency said that it still had 10,000 tons of food, enough to feed 600,000 people for one month in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An additional 11,000 tons of relief food belonging to other relief agencies is also available in Sierra Leone,&quot; it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before its warehouses were looted when fighting broke out in May, the WFP had 1,600 metric tons of food in Freetown.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNITED NATIONS, New York (PANA) - United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has said that the coup makers in Sierra Leone cannot successfully cling to power in the face of international isolation. He renewed his call on them to give up now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I did appeal to them very early in the game to reconsider their position, particularly given the fact that the people do not accept them,&quot; Annan said Thursday at a news conference in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So for them to really persist with this enterprise is going to be extremely difficult for them and for the people,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annan expressed hope that the simultaneous threat of force and efforts to seek a negotiated resolution to the conflict would convince the coup makers to return power to the country's legitimate government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sierra Leonean army officers, led by Maj. Johnny Koromah, allied with rebels of the Revolutionary United Front toppled the country's elected President, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, on May 25. He fled to neighbouring Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coup, the third in the country in five years, has attracted unprecedented international condemnation. The 16-nation Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), to which Sierra Leone is a member, has vowed to restore Kabbah to power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annan and the African leaders who met recently in Harare, Zimbabwe, have expressed support for any action that could restore Sierra Leone's legitimate government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously if all else fails force as a last resort may not be avoided, given what is happening on the ground,&quot; Annan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He restated that the U.N. was not directly involved in the negotiations being undertaken by West African countries with the coup plotters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it is the Ecowas countries that are leading the negotiations and they are also the ones with the troops on the ground,&quot; Annan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The U.N. has tended to allow regional organizations to lead where they take a situation in hand and we usually do not get involved and compete with them,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annan, who was briefing U.N. correspondents on his trip to harare to attend the O.A.U. summit, praised African leaders for their unity in condemning the coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it was remarkable in the sense that barely two years ago there was a coup in The Gambia and there was no reaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But this time the leaders seem determined to discourage coups in Africa,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the U.N. World Food Programme announced it would likely begin limited relief food distribution in Sierra Leone on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency said it would try to feed the thousands of vulnerable people in Freetown, Kenema, Bo and Makeni, most of whom are in hospitals, clinics, orphanages and schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of these people were being helped by the agency before the current conflict but thousands more have arrived recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most foreign agencies, including those of the U.N. have been forced to withdraw their personnel from the war-ravaged Freetown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the army seizure the price of staple foods has doubled, and supplies of imports such as rice, sugar and flour are dwindling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kerosene and petrol are also in short supply and it is expected that many essential products such as fuel and rice will run out within two weeks,&quot; the agency said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said it was preparing to send help to rural areas where people affected by the war may decide to flee to neighbouring countries or other locations within Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are rushing relief food stocks to Conakry (Guinea) and San Pedro (Cote d'Ivoire) in case we suddenly start to see large refugee movements,&quot; said Jamie Wickens, the agency's manager for West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN food distribution agency said that it still had 10,000 tons of food, enough to feed 600,000 people for one month in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An additional 11,000 tons of relief food belonging to other relief agencies is also available in Sierra Leone,&quot; it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before its warehouses were looted when fighting broke out in May, the agency had 1,600 metric tons of food in Freetown.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The International Organization for Migration said Friday that it might suspend the transfer of demobilized UNITA soldiers to their homes in Angola by the end of June because it had no money for the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization, which deals with the return and resettlement of displaced persons and returnees in conflict situations, said that it has been able to return to their home 28,000 of the 159,000 demobilized UNITA soldiers being held in assembly areas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From its Geneva headquarters, the agency said it had received just three million U.S. dollars of the 15 million dollars it requires for the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said the return of a group of 22,000 demobilized soldiers in the southern Cuando Cubango Province, set to begin June 24, would not start unless funds were received in time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unless additional firm pledges are received soon, the IOM's director general will have to decide shortly on suspending the operation or bringing it to a halt at the end of June.&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between 1,500 and 2,000 delegates from 138-member nations of adhering to the convention are in Harare to decide on 75 proposals involving 85 species, including the elephant, which Zimbabwe wants downlisted to allow controlled trade in ivory and other products.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official tour operator for the conference, Tourism Services Zimbabwe, reported Friday that they had not experienced any &quot;downlisting&quot; of business since the meeting began June 9.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company's marketing executive, Raymond Chimhandamba, told the Zimbabwe Inter-Africa News Agency that their tour packages to the legendary northern resort of Victoria Falls and Hwange National Park were proving popular. Delegates going to these sites are from places such as the Pacific Ocean states of Tahiti and Vanuatu, eager to see wild elephants, lions and leopard in their natural habitat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When they were not pouring through stacks of documents on the exotic species such as the north atlantic minke whale or the edible-nest swiftlet, some delegates took time off for day trips to the lion and cheetah Park, and the Imire Game Reserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although all within close proximity to Harare, the Zimbabwe capital, the are stocked with impressive variety of animals that normally roam Zimbabwe's forests, game parks and wildlife conservancies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Business has been very, very successful,&quot; Chimhandamba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for United Touring Company also reported brisk business, saying their tour packages to Victoria Falls, Hwange and the scenic Eastern Highlands were always fully subscribed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - South Africa voiced support Friday for a strictly controlled legal trade in the rhino horn and other products saying that would reduce illegal activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief executive of the Natal Parks Board in the South African province of Kwazulu-Natal, George Hughes, gave a lengthy presentation at the 10th conference of Cites in Harare, Zimbabwe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the availability of a legal source of rhino horn would provide a strong disincentive to consumers to buy horn on the black market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa, which has a Southern White rhino population of between 7,200 and 7,500, is proposing that restrictions preventing international trade in the animal and other products be lifted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hughes told the conference that the trade ban had been ineffective in protecting rhinos. He said only those populations that had been effectively protected and managed had maintained or increased their numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The use of rhino horn was deeply entrenched in Chinese traditional medicine, he added, and this measure would ensure that demand would persist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the sustained increase in Southern White numbers from 20 to at least 7,500 over the last 100 years, and the stabilization of black rhino numbers in Africa since 1992, could be attributed to the contribution of well protected and managed populations in a number of range states, especially South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Hughes said that South Africa did not want to trade in the rhino horn immediately. What it wants now is a zero quota once a strictly controlled marketing system has been accepted by Cites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that at current growths rates, the South African white rhino population would double to 14,000 within a decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic incentives were required, he said, to ensure that sufficient private land was managed for wildlife and was made available to rhinos.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Delegates at the ongoing conference on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species voted 50-49 Friday to shoot down a United States proposal to set up a working group on marine fish species.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's premature and unnecessary to establish the working group now because that is already being looked after by FAO and not Cites,&quot; said Hiromisa Isa, head of the Japanese delegation on marine fisheries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Maybe we can consider the establishment of the working group in the long-term,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group would have been responsible for marine fish and invertebrate species subject to international trade. It would have included small and large fishing nations that were parties to the convention, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, regional fisheries management and conservation organizations to champion issues concerning marine fishing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group would also have prepared an analysis of technical and practical implementation concerns associated with the potential inclusion in Appendix II of marine fish and invertebrate species. It would also have made recommendations for consideration at the 11th meeting of the conference of the parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. is one of the major powers, at conference, opposing proposals by Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe to have elephant downlisted from Appendix I, which does not allow trade in ivory, to Appendix II, which allows controlled trade.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - During the week of June 9, 1997, Ojukutu Macaulay, host of the on-air talk show &quot;Good Morning Freetown&quot;, which broadcasts Monday through Friday on FM 106.6 (Skyy FM) was confronted by a group of AFRC soldiers two hours after his public argument with an unidentified fellow journalist at No. 1 Short Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the argument, Macaulay stated that he does not and will not ever support the recent coup led by Major Johnny Paul Koromah.  As Macaulay returned to his home the AFRC soldiers confronted him and threatened that &quot;they would divide him into four parts&quot; if he does not cease making statements against the coup. Macaulay has gone into hiding and is no longer residing at his home.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Makeni-based stringer Sylvester Rogers is reported to have gone into hiding because AFRC soldiers are trying to locate him as a result of his reports, broadcast on the BBC. The reports were about the AFRC supplying local gin and marijuana to potential supporters who they were enticing to attend a rally in support of the recent coup.  According to Rogers, the majority of civilians refused to attend the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of June 7, 1997, the independent newspaper &quot;For di People&quot; resumed daily publication, except Sunday, in a 4-page format (reduced from the usual 8-page format). The resumption of publication is reportedly due to the newspaper's ownership of a printing press. However &quot;For di People&quot; is not granting other independent newspapers access to their printing press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lead story in the June 11, 1997 issue of &quot;For di People&quot; about AFRC representatives traveling to Libya led to an AFRC press release warning journalists that if they want to publish sensitive security issues they must contact AFRC headquarters for clarification before publishing their stories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The independent newspaper &quot;Expo Times&quot; has also resumed publication, on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, in a 4-page format.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: I have a question about the killings of refugees in Congo- Kinshasa. How confident are you that United Nations human rights investigators are going to be able to achieve their mission?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

He did promise me that he will cooperate, and I pressed him to appoint a senior official with authority, with access to him, who can take decisions to work with the UNHCR. There and then he indicated that he would appoint the Minister of Construction, and he has since done that. The UNHCR has also named a focal point, Assistant Secretary-General Sergio de Mello, and they are already in the region and are hoping to sit down with the representatives of President Kabila to discuss a plan and move on with this implementation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think President Kabila has begun to realize the importance and urgency of resolving, and the need to resolve, these issues - not only the humanitarian issue, but also the question of human rights and the investigation into the alleged mass murders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of my discussions with him, he said: &quot;Mr. Annan, I understand. I also want to get this albatross off my neck&quot;. He did, in effect, also offer this same commitment to Ambassador Richardson when they met subsequently in Congo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have Ralph Zacklin -- the Acting High Commissioner, coming into town today, and we are going to pursue this issue aggressively, and send in an advance team on 20 June and the full investigators on 7 July.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations - Comments by Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Sierra Leone at a press conference at the United Nations Headquarters on 12 June</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Given that negotiations between West African leaders and the coup plotters in Sierra Leone do not seem to be going anywhere, would you support the use of force, perhaps as a last resort, to dislodge the coup plotters? And also, are you concerned about the effect this will have on the Liberian peace process?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SECRETARY-GENERAL: I think that my position on this has been very clear, and I did appeal to the coup makers very early in the game to reconsider their position -- particularly given the fact that the people do not accept them, the neighbours do not want them, the region doesn't welcome them and neither does the international community. So for them to really persist with this enterprise is going to be extremely difficult for them, and for the people. I would hope, therefore, that the combined effort of negotiations and the military presence on the ground will bring them around to giving up power and returning it to the legitimate Government. Obviously, if all else fails, given the constellation in the region and the forces on the ground, force as a last resort may not be avoided, given what has happened on the ground.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: In some of your comments recently you had indicated that you might be willing to consider the use of the more respectable mercenary organizations to help out in various tasks normally associated with peace-keeping. For example, one mercenary group did assist in security around Kinshasa recently. I was wondering if you could clarify your views on when and how and if mercenaries should be employed by the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SECRETARY-GENERAL: First of all, I don't know how one makes a distinction between respectable mercenaries and non-respectable mercenaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly, I am not aware that I have made any recent statements implying that I will accept mercenaries in these situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happened was, about two years ago, when we were trying to see what could be done to separate the armed elements from the refugees on the Rwandan-Zairian border and no Governments wanted to offer troops, one of the options that was looked at was the possibility of bringing in other elements -- not necessarily troops from Governments -- who might be able to provide security, assist the aid workers in the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and protect them as they did their work. That was discarded, and this was two years ago. Recently, I have not had any such discussions. . . .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: To go back to Sierra Leone for a moment, what exactly is the United Nations involvement right now? I understand that early on in the crisis your representative, Ambassador Berhanu Dinka, was involved in negotiating with the coup plotters. What is the situation on the ground, in view of the fact that the United Nations has evacuated? Is the United Nations system still officially engaged in negotiations, and are there plans for post- resolution of this crisis?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SECRETARY-GENERAL: We are not directly involved with the negotiations. I think it is the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) countries that are leading the negotiations, and they are also the ones with the troops on the ground. The United Nations has, in practice, tended to allow regional organizations to lead where they take a situation in hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We usually do not get involved and compete with them. There have been situations where we have done it together. For example, this morning I instructed Ambassador Mohamed Sahnoun to go to Kinshasa and then to the Central African Republic to join President Omar Bongo in the negotiations between the protagonists in Congo- Brazzaville. But in the case of Sierra Leone, it is entirely in the hands of the West African countries. I know that Ghana sent in a team from Ambassador James Victor Gbeho, who was a Permanent Representative here, to meet with a group of generals to negotiate the situation. We are staying close to it, but we are not directly involved in the negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You may also recall that prior to the conflict, we had prepared a peace- keeping force to go in and help implement the agreement that was signed with the Revolutionary United Front (RUF).  Obviously, when all this has settled down we will need to reassess the situation and determine what steps the United Nations should take, whether the agreement still exists, whether the agreement is implementable, whether the RUF -- which has now joined the coup makers -- will still honour the agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we will have to reassess the situation to determine what we do next.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations - Statement by Secretary-General Kofi Annan on his recent Africa trip at a press conference at the United Nations Headquarters on 12 June</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SECRETARY-GENERAL: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It has been a while since we met. I thought it would be helpful if we met today, and for me to share with you some of the discussions I had in the Organization of African Unity (OAU) with regard to what is happening in the Great Lakes region and in Sierra Leone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OAU discussions were particularly interesting this year. In addition to discussing the crises around Africa, there was quite a lot of discussion on human rights, democratization and economic issues. We, in fact, had a brief summit where the Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) briefed the Heads of States on economic issues and what he thought the African Governments have to do to move their region forward in the area of economic and social development. There was quite a lot of sympathy for the work that needs to be done in the Republic of Congo to help President Laurent Kabila and his team rebuild the nation, get the infrastructure going, and eventually organize elections at an appropriate time. But I think what was most remarkable was the reaction of the Heads of State to the coup in Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were at one in condemning the coup and encouraging the Governments in the region that everything should be done to restore the legitimate Government back to power. It is remarkable in the sense that, barely a year ago, there was a coup in Gambia and there was no reaction, but this time the leaders seem determined to discourage coups in Africa. In fact, I did make a statement in Harare which really covered the issues of human rights, democratization and the rule of law. I hope Fred Eckhard will make copies available to you.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations - Following is the text of the message of Secretary-General Kofi A. Annan to the opening June 12 in Geneva of the Special Conference to Support the Peace Process in Liberia:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Welcome to the United Nations. I would like to begin by expressing my deep gratitude to you all for your dedication to the peace process in Liberia. You have already achieved much and the challenge now is to see the peace take genuine root.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have all been reminded in these last few weeks of the fragility of peace and democracy in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sierra Leone, a democratically elected Government was overthrown by a junta of soldiers without any support, either within or without their country. Their illegitimate, misguided grab for power must be reversed -- peacefully, if at all possible -- for Sierra Leone's sake, for Liberia's sake, for the sake of all of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have just returned from the Organization of African Unity (OAU) summit in Harare and I can report that Africa is speaking with one voice in support of democracy and against the rule of the gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The promise of a third wave of democracy, human rights and development for Africa is present. It is for Africa and her friends in the international community to make it a reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your efforts in Liberia are central to that process.  Representing the key partners among the international community -- the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the International Contact Group, the United Nations System -- your Conference signals the determination to restore lasting security and the rule of law to Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Free, fair and credible elections are the next, crucial step in this process. An ambitious timetable has been set, culminating in elections on 19 July and making the task even more challenging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The electoral season raises the stakes for us all -- demanding more security, greater resources and a determination not to allow delays or disruptions to alter the basic course to representative government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we succeed -- as I am confident we will -- Liberia can become a model of post-conflict reconstruction involving national leaders, regional organizations and the United Nations. Its neighbours near and far will know that it can be done, even in the most difficult of circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let us redouble our efforts in this last stretch of the process to bring peace to Liberia. The hopes of the continent are with you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I wish you all success in your deliberations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - Water is flowing from the taps once again for the residents of the southern Rwandan town of Nyanza. Less than 24 hours after receiving a request from the local authorities, the ICRC had a new pump delivered from its Kigali warehouse.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyanza's 29,000 residents were suffering from a severe water shortage after two of the three pumps feeding the municipal reservoir had broken down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new pump, with a capacity of 35 cu.m/hour, has restored the water supply for the town's population and for its schools, hospital, health facilities and detention centres. The construction of the cement base, the plumbing and electrical connections were handled by the national utility company, Electrogaz. &quot;Over the past few years we have done our best to provide emergency assistance to those in need&quot;, said Nicolas Stein, head of the ICRC's water and sanitation unit in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - Following the coup of 25 May, political and military negotiations regarding possible solutions continued in Abidjan, Ctte d'Ivoire, and Abuja, Nigeria, between the authorities there and delegations of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) in control in Sierra Leone. Representatives from Gambia and Ghana were also involved in the talks in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, the situation throughout the country remains chaotic, with no government offices and few schools open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hospitals are functioning at only a very low level, if at all.  No supplies are entering the capital, fuel is running short and there is no commercial traffic. Thousands are said to be leaving Freetown towards the north, Bo and Guinea. In addition to the problems of daily life (lack of supplies and medical care, risk of electricity failures and subsequent water supply problems), the population fears the possibility of renewed armed confrontation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICRC has maintained and stepped up its contacts with all parties (those manning the checkpoints, commanders, AFRC representatives, special forces, RUF members, Liberians, Nigerians, Guineans and Kamajors) with a view to obtaining adequate security guarantees for its work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, 3 June the ICRC addressed a memorandum on respect for international humanitarian law to the Executive Secretariat of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in Abuja, Nigeria - to be forwarded to member states with troops in Sierra Leone - and to the Chief of Defence Staff in Lagos. The memorandum was also submitted to ECOMOG (the ECOWAS Monitoring group) in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medical activities: arrival of a surgical team</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICRC is following the case of the six wounded soldiers whom it evacuated from the Mammy Yoko hotel and subsequently visited on 3 June in a military hospital, along with six more who had made their own way there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An ICRC surgical team, consisting of a surgeon, an anaesthetist and a theatre nurse, was brought in to Freetown on Thursday evening, 5 June by helicopter from Monrovia. The team started work immediately at the Netland hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICRC's presence in Freetown throughout the events has enabled a minimal level of surgical care to be maintained and has had a definite impact on the morale and availability of local doctors. Medical supplies have been distributed to the Connaught, Netland and Wilberforce hospitals. On 5 June, as blood bank supplies were low, the Sierra Leone Red Cross Society (SLRCS) put out radio requests for voluntary donors, and provided blood to the Connaught hospital. To assist the minimal staff there, six SLRCS first-aiders were deployed, as well as four others at the Netland hospital. On 6 June the SLRCS and ICRC transferred two war wounded from the medical ward of an army training centre in Waterloo to Wilberforce hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the water and sanitation situation in Freetown is likely to give cause for concern, as no refuse collection service has been in operation for ten days, the ICRC is to send an engineer next week to assess the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Pujehun, Kailahun and Kenema districts, the ICRC has continued to support ten local clinics. In Kenema, however, staff in the government hospital more or less stopped working on 27 May, and the hospital remains closed. In the only other medical facility, the Nongowa clinic, the ICRC nurse, along with two local doctors, has been giving basic medical treatment and changing dressings for the patients. The SLRCS, supported by the ICRC, has opened a dispensary at the Nongowa clinic to provide basic care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Food and seed distributions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Food from ICRC stocks was distributed on 6 and 7 June in Zimmi to vulnerable groups of people (pregnant women, nursing mothers, children and the elderly). In all, over 17 tonnes of oil, beans, corn meal, etc., were distributed to about 5,000 beneficiaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, in Kenema, Segbwema and Zimmi, the ICRC is preparing to continue with the rice and groundnut seed distribution, to coincide with the onset of the rainy season, under its agricultural rehabilitation programme. It will start on 10 June in Zimmi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Freetown, the ICRC on 4 June gave bulgur, lentils and oil to the Connaught and Netland hospitals and to a feeding centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Segbwema and Daru</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 5 June the ICRC visited all the camps for the internally displaced to assess the humanitarian situation. In all, over 3,000 people are reported to have arrived recently. Food and other basic provisions are in short supply. In view of the events, the ICRC in Segbwema gave further assistance to a centre for unaccompanied children, even though the planned 12-week distributions for the centre had already been completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Personnel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 3 June the ICRC has increased its expatriate staff by the three members of the surgical team and a new medical coordinator.  In all, 16 expatriates (three French, two Icelandic, one each from the Netherlands, Norway and Portugal, and eight Swiss) are based in Freetown (nine), Kenema (five) and Zimmi (two).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is extremely concerned about the fighting that has been raging in Brazzaville for more than a week, undoubtedly claiming numerous civilian lives in this highly populated urban area, and the ICRC fears that further hostilities will have disastrous consequences in humanitarian terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICRC calls on all the parties involved to abide by the rules of international humanitarian law, and in particular to make a clear distinction between combatants and civilians and to respect persons who are not or are no longer taking part in the hostilities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also emphasizes that it is prohibited to launch indiscriminate attacks endangering the civilian population, to use civilians as human shields, and to terrorize the population.  Individuals no longer participating in the fighting, such as wounded or sick combatants, must be collected and given proper care, and those captured must be treated humanely.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - After being trapped indoors for several days by the heavy fighting in Brazzaville, ICRC delegates were finally able to reach the airport on 10 June and begin to help evacuate foreigners from the town, using an ICRC-chartered plane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Priority is being given to women, children and the ill.  Fourteen people were taken across the river to Kinshasa on the first flight and further trips back and forth are now taking place.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authorities in Congo Brazzaville have meanwhile granted the ICRC permission to resume its flights from Kinshasa to Lukolela, where Rwandan refugees have gathered after crossing the river from the former Zaire. After a six-day interruption, the ICRC plane will start up its round-trip journeys again on 11 June to deliver food and medical supplies that will be distributed by two ICRC expatriates and volunteers from the Congolese Red Cross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Homeward bound</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Planes, boats, trains, trucks, cars... just about every means of transport imaginable was brought into play for the ICRC's transfer of more than 6,500 people displaced within the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The operation began on 15 April with an airlift: using a Hercules, a Boeing 727 and a DC3 (later joined by another transport plane dispatched from Nairobi), in six weeks the ICRC transferred a total of 6,019 people from Kisangani and Kindu to Bukavu, Goma, Isiro, Bunia and Lubumbashi. Other displaced persons were taken from Kisangani to Lubutu and Walikale by truck, and to Bafwasende by smaller vehicles. The ICRC also paid the train fares for 150 people from Lubumbashi to Kalemie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a new phase of the operation, which got under way on 2 June, a further 6,000 displaced people will be taken from Kalemie to Uvira. The whole undertaking is expected to continue for several more months, and forms part of a global assistance programme for the displaced population in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each family of returnees has been given a kit of essential items to help them settle back into their homes. The ICRC is also continuing to provide food and other assistance to the most vulnerable, in places affected by the passage of large numbers of people, looting and insecurity. A seed distribution programme is planned for the most affected areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All these assistance activities are aimed at helping between 250,000 and 300,000 people in the east of the country over the coming months. The ICRC is also continuing its rehabilitation and support work -- begun before November 1996 and maintained during the conflict -- for medical facilities in the east. This programme is seen as a vital contribution towards helping returnees resume a normal life.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London - Oxfam today welcomed US success at getting Africa's future on the agenda at the G7 Summit in Denver this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a briefing paper released today, the international development agency said that the United States was showing long- overdue world leadership in recognizing the &quot;silent crisis&quot; of Africa's deepening poverty, economic decline, and marginalization from the international stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For too long, G-7 leaders have turned a blind eye to Africa's acute problems. The new winds of change that are sweeping through Africa now give the G-7 a stark choice between responding to the tragedies associated with Sudan, Liberia, and Sierra Leone and grasping the opportunities created by Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Mozambique,&quot; said Justin Forsyth of Oxfam International.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oxfam is encouraged by US attention to Africa's problems.  However, the agency pointed out that the trade concessions and the new aid commitments in the US are minimal. The agency also has reservations about certain parts of the initiative:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- The plan only deals with a small cluster of countries regarded as success stories. Participation in the initiative is conditional on implementation of policies promoted under World Bank/IMF structural adjustment programs that have failed to generate sustained growth and have undermined investment performance and food security in Africa. Under these terms, we estimate that only five to seven countries would qualify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- The plan's call for maximum debt relief for countries under the World Bank/IMF Highly Indebted Poor Country Initiative is welcome. However, this position is at odds with attempts by the United States last month to delay relief for Uganda, the first country to be considered for relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Trade concessions for African goods are encouraging, but the plan fails to address the problems faced by African exporters as a result of collapsing economic infrastructure and high transport costs. Without an integrated trade and increased development aid package, Africa will remain dependent on wildly fluctuating primary commodity prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- The plan fails to reverse the steep decline in US aid to Africa. In the last three years, US aid has declined from 0.15 percent of GDP to 0.10 percent, the smallest share of the OECD countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In its current form, the initiative lacks real substance.  Deeper debt relief, more aid, and better terms of trade are needed if the initiative is to deliver real benefits to Africa's poor,&quot; added Mr. Forsyth.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - Text of a letter from William A. Orme, Jr., executive director, Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), June 12, 1997, to President Abdou Diouf of Senegal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) writes to strongly protest the June 4, 1997 decision of the Appellate Court to fine Sud Communication 500 million CFA (US$ 1 million) for public defamation of The Mimran Group, a sugar-importing company. This decision upholds the Magistrate Court's verdict of June 27, 1996 that in addition to the 500 million CFA fine included one month prison sentences for Abdoulaye Ndiaga Sylla, first vice-president of Sud Communication and director of Sud Quotidien; Sidy Gaye, editor in chief of Sud Quotidien, and reporters Bocar Niang, Mame Oll Faye and Ibrahim Sarr. Babacar Toure, chairperson and president of Sud Communication, was acquitted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a nonpartisan organization of journalists committed to the defense of our colleagues' rights worldwide, CPJ condemns the fine and prison sentences as unprecedented in sub-Sahara Africa and excessive for a civil case. The potential damage of this action to press freedom and journalists' right to hold and express opinions and ideas is immeasurable. These rights are guaranteed by Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and People's Rights, all to which, we respectfully remind Your Excellency, Senegal is a signatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We strongly urge Your Excellency to do everything in your power to facilitate the reversal of the Appellate Court's decision and to restore your government's reputation for fostering an environment where unrestricted press freedom can flourish.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) writes to express concern over threats made, on May 9, 1997, toward Betty Nambooze, a freelance journalist with the state-owned daily Bukedde. The threats were made by two local Council III officials of Goma sub- county (in Mukono District) and were in connection with articles, published in the May 8, 1997 edition of Bukedde, reporting on the reappearance of armed men in Makono and the displacement of Kolo village residents as a result of plans set by an Indian investor.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From now, councils have the power and authority to interview contractors and consultants and award tenders to deserving companies to rehabilitate and maintain roads in their areas,&quot; Major Chibamba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was flanked by Central Province Minister, Abel Musonda Chambeshi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Discussing Central Province, he said Kabwe Municipal Council would receive K200m for road rehabilitation this year, and each district council K100m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The roads department would spent K700m during the period.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said in Chinsali the decision was in the right direction to discuss national issues.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government should be praised for the re-introduction of the House of Chiefs as the decision was long overdue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The house would enable traditional rulers and Government to share and exchange views on national issues. He has appealed to his colleagues to elect capable chiefs to represent them effectively in the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was important if the full benefits of their house were to be realised. The chief emphasised that only enlightened chiefs were able to make democratic traditional laws for their people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And MMD youths in Solwezi central constituency have praised President Chiluba for appointing former finance and economic development deputy minister Koshita Sheng'amo Zambia's new High Commissioner to Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Solwezi central constituency MMD youth chairman Richard Mufwabule said that the youths who had confidence in the former Solwezi East member of parliament have welcomed Mr Sheng'amo's appointment wholeheartedly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Sheng'amo's apppointment clearly demonstrated that although the voters in Solwezi East rejected him in preference for a National Party candidate, Patrick Kangwa, President Chiluba and the MMD still want to utilise the potential in Mr Sheng'amo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the youths in Solwezi still remember and have great respect for Mr Sheng'ambo for the influential role he played in convincing the Government to start tarring the controversial Mutanda/Chavuma road. -Zana/ZIS.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finance Bank Marketing and Public Relations director Noel Nkhoma said in Lusaka yesterday that the awards failed to take off last week because the national soccer team were busy preparing for the World Cup match against South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Law Association of Zambia (LAZ) has backed the recent salary increments to judges as justified as they will help instil confidence and avoid corruption in the judiciary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAZ president George Kunda said in Ndola yesterday, his association had for sometime been concerned with the poor and scandalous judges' salaries which had failed to attract lawyers in private practice.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kunda condemned recent attacks from some quarters including opposition parties who claimed the salary increases were unjustified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The consequence of inadequate remuneration is that the independence of the judiciary is undermined to an extent where judges do not feel secure and confident. To instil confidence and avoid corruption, judges must be properly paid ,&quot; Mr Kunda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increments were made under the judges conditions of service Act which constituted a &quot;slight and insignificant&quot; improvement.  Members of the judiciary deserved respect as they shouldered heavy responsibilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was quite clear that Government had over the years failed to put in place sincere and deliberate policies to improve judges conditions of service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judiciary had been relegated to a somewhat inferior arm of Government in both the first and second republics Mr Kunda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAZ appealed to Government to show genuine commitment to improving the judges conditions, so that the judiciary could continue to attract the best legal brains in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warned against politicians trying to exploiting the poor conditions in the judiciary for their selfish ends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Judges' conditions of service must be improved continuously and without ulterior motives,&quot; Mr Kunda added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAZ reiterated its confidence in the Zambian judiciary and hoped that judges would continue to dispense justice fairly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia needed a strong and respected judiciary where everyone would run for arbitration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - It is indeed ironical that the same politicians who have repeatedly stressed the need for an independent judiciary are among the first ones to condemn Government for offering improved perks to judges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such ambivalent posturing just goes to show how inconsistent some politicians are. The recent mouthings from disaffected political elements over increased salaries for judges are totally uncalled for.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is absolutely nothing scandalous about paying judges reasonable salaries which are still far below what could be termed commensurate with their services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the contrary, what should be deemed scandalous is to deliberately underpay judges and thereby make them vulnerable to manipulation by the corrupt ilk in our society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The degree of autonomy and independent-mindedness exhibited by the Zambian bench depends, to a large extent, on the integrity of individual judges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They know that theirs is, indeed, a noble calling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, a concomitant prerequisite for the strengthening of the judiciary is adequate monetary reward not only for judges but magistrates and other judicial officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are far too many corrupt elements in Zambia who think that there is nothing which money cannot buy. Such people can do just about anything to pervert the course of justice if there are no sufficient checks and balances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attractive monetary perks for judges should not be perceived as a recipe for corruption but a form of insurance against the scourge of corruption which is quite prevalent in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is immoral for politicians to drag the bench into partisan politics by suggesting that any judge who passes a verdict they disagree with has been bribed by the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The independence of the judiciary can best be guaranteed by ensuring that judges are well-paid for their services and not reduced to paupers dependent on the benevolence of the government of the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We fully concur with the stand of the Law Association of Zambia (LAZ) on this matter. It is consistent with what the association has been advocating for a long time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent mouthings of frustrated politicians who over- politicised the issue of judges' salaries should be ignored with the contempt they deserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An independent judiciary is a vital pillar in democratic governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Improved perks can only enhance the degree of autonomy. Veiled threats and brazen acts of intimidation will erode the desired independence and weaken the bench.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - University of Zambia (Unza) vice chancellor Andrew Siwela has admitted that there were anomalies in the setting up of Zamnet Communications System in which he and his deputy Jorry Mwenechanya hold shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During submissions running into day two, Professor Siwela said management was in a hurry to set up Zamnet and that the lawyer who drew up the articles of incorporation misled them into thinking all legal formalities were followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof Siwela, 50, in a joint submission with his deputy Prof Mwenechanya, registrar Michael Tandeo and bursar Mafukeni Tembo before the Bobby Bwalya Commission of Inquiry was quick to mention that the university had not lost any money as a result of this anomaly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said since management had no expertise in registering a company, services were sought from a part-time lecturer in the School of Law while negotiations with the sponsors, World Bank were handled by Minister of Health Katele Kalumba.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof Siwela said the documents were prepared in haste and that he, Prof Mwenechanya and Dr Kalumba were advised to hold shares to fulfil a World Bank condition that Zamnet shares be gradually transferred to private individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said even the composition of the board of directors was selected in haste but management was given the impression that all was well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were in such a hurry but because we had no expertise in incorporating Zamnet we had to rely on a part-time lecturer in law. Out of ignorance we thought the legal requirements were followed. Now we realise there have been anomalies,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He regretted that the registration of incorporation with the registrar of companies reflected Siwela and Mwenechanya as businessmen when in fact they held Zamnet shares in trust. He said former registrar Jean Calder held shares to protect Unza's interest in Zamnet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof Siwela said management was eager to rectify the mistakes and hoped the Unza Council would reconstitute the Zamnet board in conformity with the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the board had been considering to reconstitute the Zamnet shares but did not elaborate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Justice Bwalya cautioned Unza management against dealing with non-qualified and non-practising lawyers to draw up legal documents for body corporates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From your submission, it is clear that the person you engaged did not know what he was doing. Next time use practising advocates registered with the Law Association of Zambia (LAZ), and ensure that all university workers are informed right now they are in the dark,&quot; Mr Justice Bwalya said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Prof Siwela said the scrapped human biology degree under the School of Medicine was useless as student graduates were unable to find employment afterwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was responding to a question from commissioner Steven Muliokela who wondered why management had not re-introduced it after medical students complained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Prof Siwela said five-year tenure for the vice chancellor is too long and should be restricted to two terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described his job as thankless and proposed that the term of office be reduced, renewable only once to give chance to others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioners queried why Prof Siwela incorporated his relatives in committees such as the University of Zambia Restoration Project (Unzarespro) which was set up to raise funds for the university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is wrong with my wife sitting on the committee when I am the vice chancellor and she knows the problems the university is facing? After all she mooted the Unzarespro idea in my living room,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His &quot;excessive&quot; trips abroad were justified as that was the only way to scout for supplementary donor funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof Mwenechanya admitted that some lecturers were incompetent but efforts were being made to improve the quality of education.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Paramilitary police in riot kit yesterday ringed the University of Zambia (Unza) Great East Road campus in Lusaka and barred striking workers from entering the premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only medical staff for the Unza clinic and employees of Zamnet, a Unza subsidiary, were allowed to go in.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Education Minister Syamukayumbu Syamujaye said in an interview that Government expected the Unza Council to deal with problems that have rocked the institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government has told the Unza administration to re-open the institution but refused to release any funds until the commission of inquiry completes its work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday employees who were supposed to be addressed by Unza Council chairman Mashekwa Nalumango were blocked by uncompromising policemen who said they had been instructed not to allow the workers into the campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Union leaders vainly tried to reason with the police to allow their members entry to prepare for the 09:00 hours assignment with Dr Nalumango.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Nalumango who arrived at the campus to address the employees was surprised to find police had cordoned the place.  He turned down pleas by unionists to reason with the police to allow the employees in the campus ground so he could talk to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do not know who instructed the police to be here so I have to talk to the minister and find out what is happening,&quot; he told union leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workers broke into song and dance denouncing the administration of Unza vice-chancellor Andrew Siwela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later in an interview, Dr Nalumango said it was impossible for him to meet the workers as he had not met Dr Syamujaye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police spokesman Standwell Lungu said police moved into the Unza premises to ensure there was law and order. He however, acknowledged the striking workers were peaceful.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Belgium yesterday hailed Zambia for offering to evacuate its nationals from the Shaba province in what was then Zaire in the heat of President Laurent Kabila's struggle for power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belgian ambassador to Zambia Leopold Carrewyn said when he presented credentials to President Chiluba at State House that his government had asked him to convey deep gratitude in this regard.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Carrewyn said Belgium attached great importance to continuing good relations with Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only recently those good relations became once more apparent when your Government showed its readiness to lend a helping hand if need would have arisen to evacuate Belgian nationals from Shaba province,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chiluba said Belgium was one of the few trading partners whose balance of trade was in favour of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia would continue crusading for regional peace because there could be no development in war situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Receiving credential from in-coming Japanese ambassador, Yoshihiro Nakamura, Mr Chiluba said Zambia was using Japanese aid with a view to become self-reliant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Zambia would continue implementing the on-going economic reform programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Nakamura said Japan was committed to assisting Zambia in her endeavours of nation-building despite the many economic hardships presently being experienced worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swi tzerland ambassador to Zambia Catherine Polejack who also presented her credentials said her government was monitoring Zambia's progress in economic reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Switzerland would approve 120 projects worth K1.3bn to Zambia by this month.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The United Taxis and Transport Association of Zambia (UTTA) has increased all bus and taxi fares by 25 per cent across the board, national chairman Willy Nsanda announced in Kitwe yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the association arrived at the costs after a heated meeting attended by all districts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said members initially demanded a 75 per cent rise but the executive fought to bring it down to 25 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But commuters contacted yesterday complained it will be difficult to cope with the new fares which Mr Nsanda said would be distributed today to all transporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambia Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) has described the recent fuel increase as unjustifiable and has called on people to join the protest to bring pressure on Government to rescind the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement yesterday, the labour movement regretted the price increase which came at a time when there was relative stability in the price levels as indicated by the exchange and inflation rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ZCTU called on Government to look into the possibility of eliminating unnecessary middlemen in operations and supply of fuel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia National Oil Company (ZNOC) has no justification to hike the price of fuel unless there were major movements in the prices of crude oil from its sources of supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fuel increase was a catalyst to inflation as it would rekindle a chain reaction in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZCTU wondered whether Government would treat workers demands for an increase in their salaries as unjustifiable under these circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile ZCTU president Fackson Shamenda has described the labour movement in Zambia as fragmented and not disorganised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the fragmentation had made the labour movement weak hence the need to strengthen it through unity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Pharmaceutical Society of Zambia (PSZ) and the Population Services International (PSI) yesterday launched the Society for Health (SFH) Trust aimed at institutionalising the social marketing of maximum condoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PSZ president David Phiri said the Trust would build on the success of maximum condoms social marketing project launched in 1992 which had afforded thousands of people with access to quality and affordable health products.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the launch at Pamodzi Hotel in Lusaka yesterday, Mr Phiri said the Trust would have the advantage of tapping a wider donor funding resource base which would ensure a sustainable social marketing of health products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe this is a practical demonstration of what is meant by building public/private sector partnership in the delivery of health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are proud to be part of this very exciting partnership and believe that it will go a long way in supporting and complementing the efforts of Government in curbing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV and promoting maternal and child health,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Society for Health executive director Bradford Lucas said although the launching of Maximum social marketing in 1992 was received with nervousness, it had now succeeded in empowering thousands of people to protect themselves from STDs, HIV and unwanted pregnancies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the introduction of SafePlan oral contraceptives, SFH is expanding access to this important contraceptive which can help parents plan and manage their families and improve the health of children and mothers,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The launch was officiated by Health Minister Dr Katele Kalumba.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Applications for stands should be lodged with the general manager's office as soon as possible to ensure potential exhibitors are not disappointed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An important new development is the exhibitors car park next to the PTA village which we feel will greatly assist the commercial exhibitors through out the show,&quot; he said in a statement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) has asked Kitwe City to evict more than 10,000 illegal settlers from all mine areas in readiness for potential investors who might want to utilise the areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZCCM is further asking that all squatters be removed from its areas in at least a month's time, Kitwe Town Clerk Ali Simwinga confirmed yesterday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the company has since written to council asking it to help resettle the more than 10,000 families elsewhere outside the ZCCM areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A meeting between ZCCM and the council held in Kitwe yesterday resolved that council quickly finds an alternative place in which to resettle the squatters while ZCCM said it was prepared to make a number of provisions to enable the squatters make permanent infrastructures where they were going to be resettled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Simwinga said council had already identified an area in Kawama which was big enough to accommodate all the families which faced eviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The affected townships are St. Anthony, Kandabwe and Lute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Simwinga said ZCCM had indicated that the potential buyers might want to explore and develop the areas alongside the mines after buying them because they were part of the mine restricted areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resettling of squatters in the ZCCM areas, especially St.  Anthony is an old problem which both ZCCM and the council have jointly tried to tackle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few years back, some squatters were settled in other parts of the city when ZCCM said it wanted to develop the area while others refused to move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are still occupying their houses while a few other settlers have since joined them in the area.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Telecel, a private telecommunications company to enter the Zambian market, will start operations later this month and has assured would-be customers of unmatched service and lower costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Telecel commercial director, Clive Shamwana, said in an interview in Lusaka yesterday that Telecel was here to stay and would be guided in its provision of services by what the company was allowed to do and what the market forces demand.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new company would provide competition to the parastatal monopoly, Zamtel whose services have frequently come under fire from its customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are here in a big positive way. Our aim is to broaden telecommunication services in Zambia. We are backed by our global capacity as one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are used to providing services to large populations in developed and developing countries since we operate in many countries in Africa and elsewhere in the world,&quot; Mr Shamwana said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Telecel was given a licence by the Communications Authority to deal in cellular telephones. This means that at present it cannot offer landline telephone services which Zamtel will continue to monopolise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Telecel had entered into an inter-connection agreement with Zamtel so that customers receive and send calls regardless of the origin or whether they are connected to Zamtel facility or to Telecel facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Shamwana said Telecel customers would enjoy 10 to 20 per cent lower telephone charges than at present.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zamdet was a joint venture between the Zambian Government through ZCCM (70 per cent) and Nitro Nobel AB owned 30 per cent by Dyno Industrier ASA.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Dyno Nobel own the company 100 per cent after acquiring the 70 per cent shares which were owned by Government. The company was incorporated in 1992 to produce non-electrical detonators for ZCCM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZPA chief executive, Valentine Chitalu, said Zamdet was a profit making company since its inception and in 1995 started exporting to Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of Congo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new owners had pledged to invest more money in the company to increase capacity and would not declare any of the existing staff redundant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company would eventually list some of the shares on the Lusaka Stock Exchange for Zambians to buy and be part owners of Zamdet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Present during the hand over were Swedish ambassador, Kristina Svensson, Norwegian ambassador, Jon Lomoy, senior vice president of International Dyno Nobel Europe, Knut Nilsen and ZCCM Konkola Division general manager, Benedict Chileshe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mrs Svensson said the purchase of Zamdet was a good example of the partnership between Zambia and Sweden as it showed that good investment should create jobs in Zambia and in Sweden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Lomoy said the investment was a good example of commercial links between countries which should be beneficial to both partners. He hoped that the new investors would bring with them the work culture from Norway and help Zambia develop.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, delivered by Mr. Christian Lehember, resident representative of UNDP, shows the extent, severity, and complexity of global poverty and proposes a new feasible strategy known as &quot;the human poverty index (HPI)&quot; in a bid to eradicate it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new measurement HPI, ranks countries by three variables: vulnerability to death at an early age, the prevalence of illiteracy, and access to health services, safe water and adequate food, according to the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HDR 1997 launched globally in the 134 country offices, indicates that although poverty has been dramatically reduced in many parts of the world during the 20th century, a quarter of the world people still remain in severe poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delivering the report, Mr. Christian Lehember, said the world in general and Africa in particular face a lot of daunting problems &quot;as we enter the 21st century.&quot; He, however, said, if governments, NGOs, donors and the UN, can work together, eradicating poverty in the 21st century will be feasible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on the occasion, Ato Mekonen Manyazewal, vice Minister of Economic Development and Cooperation appreciated the introduction of the human poverty index (HPI) which unlike previous strategies analyses the root cause of poverty and suggest an action plan for its eradication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;HDR 1997 is very much in line with the new programmes and policies designed by Ethiopia's government with a view to eradicating poverty,&quot; Ato Mekonen said adding that presently the government and the UNDP are for the first country cooperation frame work (CCFI) which covers the period 1997-2001.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA) - A prosecution witness told the Federal High court yesterday that tortures were beating the corpse of an individual, a Jehovah Witness, even after his death in their hands, claiming that the victim &quot;was pretending to be dead&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness who claimed to have been imprisoned in Kebele 07 of Woreda 22 in 1978 said he would never forget the scene at which the victim, Ato Woube, was beaten to death and his body stamped by his tormentors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness who appeared before the First Criminal Bench of the Federal High Court said another victim who belongs to the same faith, had been severely tortured. His finger nails were pulled out and his skin was peeled by the tortures.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness has testified that Ato Berhanu, the victim who could no more bear the torture had secretly written a letter exposing the atrocities against him to the World council of Churches through his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the witness said, the letter was intercepted prior to reaching its destinations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the discovery of the letter, the victim had confessed that he did write the letter with Ato Girma Worku, the witness himself. &quot;I was also beaten along with the victim for being an accomplice in writing the letter,&quot; he told the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness said, an inmate, Kifle Gebre-Mariam was tortured while suffering from fresh wounds he sustained during examination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is immoral to wish somebody his death but when they killed Kifle we said it was deliverance,&quot; the witness told the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another witness told the court that he son, Ato Elias Zerihun, who had been working at the Anbessa City bus corporation along Tinsae Birhan was killed by the latter in 1977 after being jailed for one month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woizero Emebet Demelew, another witness said on her part that members of the army of the defunct Derg regime had killed her brother, her niece and her friend during a search launched in January 1976.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another witness said her son Teketel Mehiretu had been imprisoned in Woreda 8 and added she had been supplying him with food for six consecutive days.  She said the detainers one day drove him home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He (her son) said I came here to bid fare well, he screamed and fell over the ground, and detainers had killed him there on the spot,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial was adjourned until June 17.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Environmentalists fear that the long-awaited strategic environmental assessment of Cape Town's bid for the 2004 Olympic Games could be flawed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government's withholding of a report by the Development Bank of Southern Africa, coupled with the confidentiality of the Bid Company's financial records, &quot;effectively prevents any rigorous financial and economic review&quot;, says the chairman of the Western Cape region of the Wildlife and Environment Society of South Africa, Graham Avery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;potential for the assessment to provide a conclusive analysis has been fundamentally undermined&quot;, he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The public needs substantive answers from the Bid Company and the government to convince it of their sincerity and of the economic and environmental soundness of the bid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Avery said the society was unable to decide whether it was for or against the bid in the absence of &quot;sufficient information&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bid Company spokesman Ameen Akhalwaya said it was false to claim that there was no public oversight of the bid's finances, since public representatives served on the bid board, and all records were scrutinised by the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are committed to accessibility, and any organisation is free to approach us for information.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he added: &quot;There are certain things we cannot disclose without undermining our strategy in what is a tough, international competition for a multibillion-rand investment. It would be irresponsible to overlook that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Development Bank report predicts that a Cape Town Games will generate 100 000 permanent jobs - half in the Western Cape - tax income to the government of about R8-billion over 10 years from 1997, and a R30-billion gross domestic product boost over the same period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questioned about these figures, bank chief executive Ian Goldin has indicated to the International Olympic Committee that even in a &quot;worst-case&quot; scenario of cost over-runs and lower-than-expected revenues, the Olympics would still be good for South Africa in generating higher incomes, jobs and higher state revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have done a lot of number-crunching, sensitivity analysis, what-ifs on cost over-runs, revenues not coming in ... and in the worst-case scenario we believe it will still make sense. The country as a whole will do better.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The owner of an Athlone petrol station has described how the staff of his forecourt shop stared down the barrel of the gun of the alleged killers of Simon's Town couple Ratilal Kessow and Henrietha Millward - and survived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a bizarre twist, another armed gang hit the same shop just two days later while the area was swarming with police searching for clues in a hunt for the first gang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Once is enough, but twice in two days is just too much,&quot; said owner Jaleel Sayed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Kessow and Mrs Millward were hijacked and murdered and their bodies dumped in Mitchell's Plain. A short while later a gang of five men in Dr Kessow's car attacked a garage 2km away. They then hit the Athlone petrol station, taking R2 200.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday Mr Sayed's staff again had to face armed robbers - who stole R1 700. &quot;Both times my closed-circuit video monitoring system captured the perpetrators on film,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The tapes show the robbers' every move and their faces are as clear as in a photograph. But it's frightening to think what could have happened - especially in the first attack when the gang had already pulled off attacks, including a double murder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The video showed the gang pulling up in Dr Kessow's BMW at 4.52am. Then three men got out of the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The driver, who wore a black jacket and a black cap, bent down as he got out of the car and put on white surgical gloves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then all three entered my shop together. Inside, they spread out, with one waiting in the middle of the shop while the other two moved to the cash point and asked for cooldrink - as if they couldn't see the huge cooldrink fridges on the other side of the shop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the men, who had a moustache, then pulled out a gun, and two of them moved behind the counter. My assistant looked straight down the barrel of the man's gun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At that moment another car stopped outside. The forecourt staff were still unaware of the drama in the shop. The customer took out R20 and sent a petrol attendant into the shop to buy cigarettes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the video you can see how the dozy attendant walked right into the robbery with his head down. He realised what was happening only when one of the robbers grabbed the R20 out of his hand and told him to put his hands in the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The customer saw this and pulled off at quite a speed. That was the funny part - if there could ever be anything funny about a robbery,&quot; said Mr Sayed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on Tuesday, two men pulled up in an old Volkswagen Beetle, masked themselves and pulled off a second robbery. &quot;One was a midget and the other was clumsy, dropping the gun - which went off, waking a resident nearby,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is at the heart of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's mandate: seeking and promoting reconciliation in a brutally fractured society, through a full and candid acknowledgement of the often painful truth about its past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No-one suggests the commission will be able to uncover the full truth of the years between 1960 and 1994; clearly, that would be an impossible task, and truth is an ephemeral and elusive concept at the best of times.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what the commission can do - and is doing - is to uncover and bring us face to face with events and incidents from this brief period of our history that were sometimes deliberately concealed from sections of the population, while all too obvious to others, or which were blatantly denied by the powers-that-be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grim photograph which this newspaper carried on its front page yesterday of three policemen posing &quot;hunter-style&quot; with the body of a black man - apparently taken during the violent conflict that wracked the KTC squatter settlement in 1986 - is one such incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a nauseating image that is likely to evoke deep anger and outrage in anyone who sees it . But even more disturbing is the fact that it was by no means an isolated case during the apartheid era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More and more hard evidence is coming to light in TRC hearings of a pervasive brutality in the apartheid police force, giving the lie to the National Party's repeated claims that illegal activities were the work of a &quot;rogue&quot; few, and demonstrating anew the daunting task that still lies ahead for those seeking to promote national unity and reconciliation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The Cape Metropolitan Council (CMC) is considering raising about R150-million on the capital market next year to fund major water and sewerage projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a meeting this week the council's finance committee decided to recommend that agency Duff &amp; Phelps be asked to give the CMC a rating ahead of an approach to the capital market.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acting chief director of finance at the CMC Hennie Smit said the rating would help the council raise money on the market at competitive interest rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The funds would probably not be needed in the 1997-98 financial year, he said. But from next month the CMC, which was taking on responsibility for bulk water and sewerage services for all six municipalities in the area, would probably need loan finance to cover costs in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For instance, we are taking on all sewerage and pumping works in the Peninsula, including the Cape Flats sewerage works, which we have taken over from the Cape Town municipality and which has to be extended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The municipality has financed these extensions with loans of about R150 million from Investec and the Development Bank of Southern Africa, but we are looking at further extensions in mid- 1998 and we may need to approach the capital markets then.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The loan would be &quot;of the same order&quot; as the current extensions, he said, and the CMC might also need money for water provision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duff &amp; Phelps, which is charging the CMC R25 000 to do the rating, was one of two agencies which submitted proposals. The other was IBCA.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Joe Mangcu wishes he was living in a world where no animal had to suffer, but since he is not, he dedicates himself to easing their plight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born in East London, Joe came to Cape Town in 1984, living first in the township of Langa and later in Khayelitsha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even as a child, Joe grew up learning to love pets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I grew up in a family that loved animals, and had a dog and a cat, and I was taught to respect and care for animals from an early age,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the young Joe, learning about animals was almost part of his rites of passage, if you will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To gain acceptance as a young man one would have to leave one's home in the city and spend time in the country learning about all the different kinds of animals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In those days few people kept dogs or cats in their homes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the passage of time, Joe has learnt much about animals and has come to love them and care for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A receptionist for a city electronics company, Joe spends most of his free time running an animal care clinic in Khayelitsha, and helping all the township's sick and wounded animals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clinic, which is staffed by professional vets, operates at weekends only, although Joe would like to see it expanding its activities to include weekdays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But how did this all begin?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At Langa I used to pick up the stray dogs at the station and take them to the Athlone animal clinic,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I moved to Khayelitsha, I was shocked to find that there was no animal clinic there, but only a mobile clinic for an hour at each township.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Realising the dire need for a permanent clinic, Joe began to lobby for one and to make representations in the relevant corridors of power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe even wrote to President Mandela, telling him of the plight in the township but wherever he went, he was sent elsewhere on a wild goose chase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday mornings you will find Joe at the modest clinic, often attending to the sick and injured himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it is something minor, I can attend to it myself, but if it is serious I have to wait for a vet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because Joe doesn't drive a car, he gets around the city either by train or on foot, and so it is often that he comes across sick or wounded animals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of them have been run over by cars, others bitten by other animals, and some even stabbed by people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I cannot understand why people would want to stab a dog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have come across small dogs (he gestures with his hand to show the size of a small lapdog) that have been stabbed or injured by people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Often on his way home from work, he might come across a stray dog or one that is clearly in need of medical attention and will take it home and to the clinic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is not a dog that has been through the clinic that does not remember me afterwards, and greets me with a friendly lick - even those that are regarded by some people as vicious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joe feels that there is an urgent need for education about animal rights and the importance of looking after animals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People need to be taught about this from an early age and children need to be shown programmes about animal care on television.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stray dogs are a common sight in Khayelitsha, says Joe, and the situation is not improving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He estimates that about 70 percent of the dog population are strays and that the figure for cats is about 25 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we need so badly is to go through the township, find all the unwanted or animals and find homes for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do not believe in killing animals&quot;, says Joe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most of them are starving and once they get food they will pick up weight and become beautiful animals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another aspect that concerns him is that of giving pets the right food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The days when one cooked meat and pap and give the scraps to the dogs are gone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One needs to give them proper (nutritional) food.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And one of the major problems facing Joe is the lack of transport for bringing in sick animals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Without transport, I am simply not able to reach all the animals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes I am phoned late at night, but I am unable to reach a sick or injured animal because I do not have any transport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If I ask the taxis they say 'this taxi is not for dogs, it is for people'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from being a selfless and gentle man dedicated to easing the suffering of all those creatures smaller than himself, Joe is also ambitious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although his home language is Xhosa, he is fluent in English and he attends night school, where he is taking classes in languages and mathematics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes he gets home as late as 10pm, exhausted after a busy day at work, as well as by his classes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is Joe's dream?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To &quot;learn more about animals,&quot; he says with a broad smile.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Mpumalanga premier, Mathews Phosa, on Thursday blamed apartheid for the sub region's refugee problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing an international conference on refugees in Nelspruit, Phosa said apartheid created the refugee problem through a campaign to destroy the economies of the sub region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said today, South Africa deported 400 Mozambicans daily, at a cost of R450 to R600 per person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But 300 of them return within 24 hours,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the South African National Defence Force spent R700 million of its annual budget for border protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1996, he said, the Department of Home Affairs spent R7,6 million to deport illegal immigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quoting a writer, Phosa said: &quot;'The impact of apartheid in the region represents a holocaust that few people outside the region know about or comprehend.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe that any solution to the problem of refugees, ignoring the reality, will be superficial and will not stand a chance of succeeding,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said no country could solve the refugee problem in isolation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - More than half of the Mozambican refugees who registered to be repatriated to Mozambique four years ago, are still in South Africa, said Mozambique's deputy minister of social welfare, Felipe Ricardo Monjate on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing an international conference on refugees in Nelspruit, Monjate said only 65 000 of the 175 000 Mozambican refugees had been repatriated since an agreement was signed between Mozambique, South Africa and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) in 1993.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director of UNHCR Operations in Southern Africa, Nicholas Bwakira, said repatriated Mozambicans had created a massive influx into seven of Mozambique's 10 provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warned that the return of refugees to their countries of birth had to be sustainable and not lead to another outflow of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said problems affecting refugees in most countries related to socio-economic factors and political instability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the UNHCR would use the shift to democracy in Africa to foster peace and tolerance, and to allocate sustainable resources to affected communities and help them strengthen their capacity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - The Truth and Reconciliation Commission's (TRC) amnesty committee heard on Thursday that Chris Hani, the late secretary general of the South African Communist Party, ordered the killings of two of Mpumalanga's leading ANC politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty applicant, Derrick Skosana (26) told the committee that Mpumalanga's former ANC secretary, Joe Nkuna, said Hani issued an order that all &quot;enemy&quot; agents be killed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Included in the list of alleged double agents were Mpumalanga's current MEC for Finance, Jacques Modipane, and MEC for Public Works, Jackson Mthembu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skosana said the list of double agents also included ANC treasurer at the time, Johannes Shabangu, whose house was the only one actually attacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skosana said Modipane's house was not attacked, as he was not home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six people were in Shabangu's house during the attack on Novemer 11, 1992, including Mpumalanga's current MEC for sports, culture, arts and recreation, Lassy Chiwayo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skosana told the TRC on Thursday that his cousin, Peter Mnisi, was also in the house at the time of the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know I did something wrong but I was under the impression that it was right thing to do for our movement at that time. And I am really sorry for what I have done,&quot; said Skosana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he would not have attacked Shabangu's house if Nkuna had not said that the instructions came directly from Chris Hani and that Hani was asking for a progress report on the elimination of double agents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skosana is serving five years in jail for the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkuna, who is serving seven years for the attack, and his brother, Conrad, who is serving five years for the same attack, have already testified before the committee.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MBABANE (Swaziland) - Illovo Sugar announced on Wednesday afternoon that it is to be listed on the Swaziland Stock Exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement follows shortly after Illovo acquired the majority stake in Swaziland's Ubombo Ranches Sugar Company, which plans to diversify its product range by concentrating on sugar based by-products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illovo the stock exchange listing and consolidation with Ubombo will give additional impetus to Illovu's plans to increase support for more small-holder sugar cane growing schemes to boost production at their plant at Big Bend in the South East lowveld.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The formalities of the acquisition of 94 percent of Lonrho Sugar shares by Illovo are expected to be completed next Friday (June 20th), creating the biggest sugar company in Africa with annual sugar production over 1.6 million tons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The development follows a successful meeting on Monday between Illovo and the 40 percent shareholder in Ubombo Ranches - the Royal investment fund, Tibiyo TakaNgwane to discuss the acquisition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That briefing was also attended by the Swaziland government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illovo now owns 60% of Ubombo Ranches while Tibiyo owns 40%.  &quot;As a regional player, Illovo operates in 15 sugar mills throughout Africa. Swaziland will therefore benefit from the transfer of technology and expertise from the professional team already servicing the existing sugar mills of Illovo,&quot; a statement from government spokesman, Meshack Shongwe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illovo's industry position is expected to sweeten current sour relations between the Swaziland Sugar Association (SSA) and the South African Sugar Association (SASA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Monday's meeting with the Prime Minister, Dr Sibusiso Dlamini, Illovo was represented by Chairman, Richard Williams and Managing Director, Don Mcleod.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tibiyo was represented by Managing Director, Themba Dlamini and his personal secretary, Sibongile Magagula as well as two officials from the Central Bank of Swaziland (CBS), Vinah Nkambule and Esther Magagula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prime Minister paid tribute to Ubombo Ranches Managing Director, Dr Jerry Gosnell and his management and also briefed Illovo on the Swaziland Government's intentions to encourage higher participation in the sugar industry by indigenous Swazis through the Maguga Dam and Usuthu River developments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both of these projects are a priority to the government...the presence of Illovo will therefore have a significant role in these projects and will boost the sugar industry in the Kingdom,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MBABANE (Swaziland) - South Africa is to close five of its borders with Swaziland as part of a drive to combat crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African Customs Union spokesman Christo Henning told African Eye News Service (South Africa) on Thursday that the closures formed part of a national exercise to scale down the number of exit and entry points into South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is part of the SA National Strategy For Crime Prevention aimed at reducing the influx of smuggled and fake goods such as cassettes and sneakers,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also to be reduced, are the number of international airports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South African airports have been scaled down to nine from 36 and border posts have been reduced from 52 to just 19,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said only six of the current 11 border posts with Swaziland would be retained. They are Oshoek, Nerston, Mahamba, Golela, Mananga and Jeppes Reef.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henning stressed that some of the border posts marked for closure were still operating, but said that they would be phased out before the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These include Botha's Hoop-Gege, Emahlathini, Josefdal-Bulembu, Waverley-Lundzi and Onverwacht-Nsalitshe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The closure announcement comes in the wake of Swaziland's biggest drug bust ever, in which a dagga shipment estimated to be worth over R7,2 million destined for South Africa was found by Royal Swaziland Police last week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MBABANE (Swaziland) - An unprecedented surge in violent vehicle hi-jackings in Swaziland have prompted police to launch a series of spot roadblocks and vehicle searches in the kingdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confirming that 107 of the 299 vehicles which had been stolen since January were taken at gun-point, police spokesman Sergeant Victor Dlamini stressed, however, the Royal Swaziland Police's recovery rate was over 50 percent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that police had already recovered 165 of the 299 stolen vehicles, and were still looking for only 134 cars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The worst months for vehicle theft this year January, when thieves stole 69 cars and for some reason during May, when they took 65 vehicles,&quot; said Sergeant Dlamini.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, Swaziland police cracked a syndicate using Swaziland as a transit conduit for their operations, which channelled stolen cars from Southern Africa to as far afield as Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swaziland's 11 border posts with South Africa are favourite routes to staging points in Maputo before being shipped on to east and central Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the trans-national nature of the thieves' operations, countries in the region have established a &quot;front- line&quot; crack police squad to combat the syndicates master minding the trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The squad, which will initially deal mainly with hi-jack cases, comprises of officers from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General crime has also escalated in the Kingdom of Swaziland over the past few years, with violent crime showing a particular upswing. With a population of just under 1 million people, the Kingdom has only one policeman for every 700 citizens.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - National Parks Board (NPB) officials and environmentalists on Thursday strongly opposed the possibility of a slurry pipeline being dug across the Kruger National Park into Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representatives of the Kruger National Park (KNP) called for a petition on the issue, which they said was of international, and not just local interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;About 900 000 people visit the Kruger National Park every year and spend their money here, and they should also have something to say about it,&quot; said KNP representative, Ralph Culver.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental concerns about the pipeline, which would be part of a 30-year iron production project, were raised at a public meeting in Nelspruit organised by the Independent Development Corporation (IDC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The envisaged pipeline could transfer nine megalitres of water and finely milled magnetite each day from Phalaborwa, through the park, to an iron production plant in Maputo.  According to Etienne Roux of the IDC, three possible pipeline routes, two of which pass through the Kruger National Park, were being considered as options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the option of laying the pipeline along the border of the Kruger National Park did not seem viable, however, as it was the longest of the three routes at 370km, and too many stakeholders were involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The route around the park would require negotiations with hundreds of landowners, while the routes through the park would only involve the National Parks Board and Mozambican government,&quot; Roux said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The route outside the park would also increase the cost of laying the pipeline from R90 million to R190 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roux said the route outside the park could, however, be more viable if Spoornet made an affordable offer to rail the magnetite to Maputo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roux stressed that should the pipeline be laid in the Kruger National Park, it would be buried 1,5 metres under the ground and then covered with vegetation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two possible routes through the Kruger National Park would cross a distance of either 94 km or 144 km and it is not yet known if an access road to the pipeline would be necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roux added that the pipe itself would be maintenance free and could only be damaged if accidentally hit by ploughs or earthmoving equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The magnetite itself was not toxic, he said, and therefore would not pose a serious problem if a leak should occur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kruger National Park officials are concerned, however, that the project may create a precedent for other industrial development in the park and have a cumulative impact on the ecology of the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The manager of the NPB's environmental services, Murray Macgregor, added that the construction of the pipeline would also contravene the National Parks Board Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In terms of the law, we cannot sanction any activity or development that could compromise its (the Kruger Park) conservation ethics and objectives, or the integrity of any of the national parks,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We condemn this violence because only innocent people, who know nothing about the border dispute, are being attacked daily,&quot; Supt Setati told African Eye News Service (South Africa).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pro-Mpumalagna demonstrators have been demanding for the past two months that Bushbuckridge be transferred from Northern Province to Mpumalanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, President Nelson Mandela told members of the Bushbuckridge Border Committee that Bushbuckridge would not be transferred to Mpumalanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pro-Mpumalanga demonstrators are arguing that they are economically linked to Mpumalanga as most of them work in Hazyview or Nelspruit and do their shopping there.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - The man who engineered Mpumalanga's contentious R200-million rural low cost housing development with Motheo Construction, Saths Moodley, doesn't theoretically exist in Mpumalanga's finance systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither the province's housing department nor the Provincial Service Commission have the required records and Identity numbers on their computer systems to legally pay Moodley for his two years of service on the province's now suspended Housing Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moodley retired from the board three weeks ago after Mail &amp; Guardian revealed that the Auditor General was investigating the Motheo scheme, which is the biggest rural development of its type yet in South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Housing department finance director, Belinda Mojabelo, confirmed on Wednesday that &quot;something went very wrong with Moodley's appointment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The proper channels weren't followed and we didn't get all the necessary information and documentation. We don't have his Identity Number.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to public service regulations, even casual labourers have to supply a there Home Affairs ID number before being paid by the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It appears that Moodley was paid as a creditor and not as an employee or contract worker. You see, he was appointed as a politician and not as an employee,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mojabelo also confirmed that the department has never deducted any form of income tax from its payments to Moodley and that &quot;we cannot now deduct the necessary tax because Moodley has left the department and we no longer have any power over him&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also confirmed that Moodley was paid for his services out of a special suspense account and that all payments were personally authorised by department chief director, Steve Ngwenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngwenya failed to return a series of urgent messages and his assistant, assistant director Bonniface Dlamini, twice told Mail &amp; Guardian that both he and MEC Craig Padayachee were &quot;out of town&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Various other officials in the department, including Padayachee's secretary however said that they were in office and were in a meeting discussing the Motheo issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Padayachee also failed to return M&amp;G's numerous messages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Departmental spokesperson, Leon Mbangwa, conceded that Moodley's appointment had been &quot;unusual&quot; but insisted that it had been a conscious political decision aimed at &quot;fast tracking housing delivery&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insisting that it was unnecessary for the department to have Moodley's ID number and other details before paying him, Mbangwa said Moodley was never paid a salary, only an &quot;allowance&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also denied that it was the department's responsibility to deduct income or other tax from the payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbangwa also insisted that Ngwenya was no longer connected with his previous legal practice, Steve Ngwenya &amp; Themba Kwayo Attorneys, despite the practice continuing to operate under both men's names.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He insisted that there was no conflict of interests that a large percent of the legal practice's business involved conveyancing low cost housing subsidies for the department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look, Themba bought the right to continue using Steve's name when he joined the department because Steve is very popular and influential. You are just targeting Themba because he is black,&quot; said Mbangwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Themba was clever enough to link up with Steve and use his name and that's all there is to it. Housing applicants have a choice to go to any other conveyancers or to this one, so there's nothing wrong with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He denied that applicants may be swayed by the fact that Ngwenya was a highly visible public figure within the department which granted the subsidies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Themba Kwayo was unavailable for comment at the time of going to press.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Yet another of Mpumalanga's embattled government institutions is set to crumble after details of &quot;wild &amp; irresponsible&quot; advances and financial management are revealed later today (Friday) in the province's legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Internal investigations, sparked by media reports earlier this year, have discovered that the speaker of the legislature, Elias Ginindza, authorised R272 000 worth of alternations to his personal home at State expense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An audit of the work performed, however, indicates that the value of both material and labour is less than R75 000.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ginindza insists that he was forced to carry out the alternations, including the installation of an electric gate, due to police concerns about his safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legislative officials however point out that if this was the case, then the police should have paid for the alternations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ginindza concedes that there was &quot;overspending&quot; and has reportedly suggested that the construction company which did the alternations perform additional work for the legislature to the value of R200 000 to make up the difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ginindza is not the only senior official implicated in serious irregularities. Deputy speaker, Cynthia Maropeng, has taken personal advances from the legislature for more than R75 000 over the past eight months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She has yet to pay the amount back but vehemently denied ever taking advances when initially quizzed about the issue by Mail &amp; Guardian in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She instead suggested, at a confrontation attended by Ginindza and the two other most senior legislative officials, that the questions were racially motivated and aimed at &quot;maliciously smearing&quot; black leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to internal documentation, Maropeng first took relatively small advances. Then, without explanation, she took three R10 000 advances in quick succession, followed by a single R45 000 advance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of special concern to investigators, however, is the method in which the advances are being repaid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of having payments deducted off salaries or being repaid via bank loans, S*** and other officials are 'paying' back their advances by running up additional travel and accommodation expenses with the legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, instead of being paid out for their theoretical discomfort, they simply deduct the sum off what they owe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maropeng, for example, stayed at Cape Town's Mount Nelson hotel with her child and it's nanny for an unspecified period and claimed the stay as official accommodation to be deducted off her advance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advances are also now been granted to MPLs and even junior staff members. Officials were unable to tell M&amp;G exactly how much was still owing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More details of the irregularities, including the disappearance of a substantial number of computers ordered by the legislature, &quot;massive&quot; abuse of overtime claims and the irregular appointment of staff, will be discussed at a press conference in Nelspruit later today.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - A 25 per cent bus fare increase was yesterday announced by United Transport and Taxis Association (UTTA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UTTA national chairman, Willie Nsanda, in an interview with ZNBC television yesterday, said the hike would be effected from Thursday midnight.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UTTA fare increment follows a 24 per cent fuel price effected Tuesday midnight by Zambia National Oil Company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nsanda said UTTA had considered raising the fares over the 25 per cent but were mindful that commuters were also going through economic hardships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Kitwe Chamber of Commerce chairman, Boniface Chibeza, said he was disappointment with Zambia National Oil Company's decision to increase fuel prices in the light of low World oil prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he did not understand why the company had decided to increase the already high fuel prices when even the foreign exchange rates had stabilised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chibeza said the fuel price increase destroys any hope for companies to pick up following increased costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNIP administrative secretary, Basil Kabwe, said most prices of commodities will soon go up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Come July this country will be like the former Zaire because the kwacha will be devalued to an extend that every one will be talking of leaving Zambia,&quot; Kabwe said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) deputy national secretary, Azwell Banda, said this week's fuel price increment was an indication of more serious problems to come due to the withholding of balance of payments support by the country's donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zambians should actually expect increments in all the domestic utilities because our cooperating partners are not willing to release the balance of payment support ,&quot; Banda said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - PRESIDENT Frederick Chiluba's lawyers yesterday in the Supreme Court produced evidence to dispute part of petitioner's witness Dr. Steven Moyo's evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal Affairs minister Vincent Malambo, who led the cross- examination, referred Dr. Moyo to government gazette notices of 1987, 1994 and 1996 which basically disputed his earlier evidence that polling districts had been shifted around in certain constituencies in Ndola.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The notices also discounted Dr. Moyo's evidence that the numbering of the polling districts was not serialised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A government gazette notice for the 1991 elections showed that polling districts even at that time were not serialised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another notice showed that certain polling districts which Dr.  Moyo had said were not gazetted but were only found in one of the documents he had, was not actually correct but that they were gazetted in Isoka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Dr. Moyo insisted that they were gazetted in the wrong constituency. He said his complaint yesterday had been that they were not listed under Nakonde as was supposed to be the case but were gazetted in a different town, Isoka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The examples of such polling stations were Musele, Mbokoshi and Chitambi in Northern Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This cross-examination finally degenerated into Dr. Moyo disputing some of Malambo's statements and the court adjourned at a point of the 1996 gazette notice which the petitioners wanted to verify before their witness could be questioned on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Moyo said that notice did not have Government Printers mark written on the back of it to show that it was really printed by them and his lawyer State Counsel Edward Shamwana, after examining the said notice, said they needed to check it out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cross-examination continues today.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - If opposition parties are not careful they may find themselves being fooled and used by ruling MMD again, warned Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) deputy general secretary Azwell Banda yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banda, in a walk in interview yesterday, said the agreement reached in Stockholm, Sweden between UNIP, Agenda for Zambia and the National Party, as opposition, and the ruling MMD to meet within 21 days is simply designed to help the MMD meet its Consultative Group (CG) meeting conditionalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole arrangement is as a result of the haste of (finance minister Ronald) Penza to meet CG conditionalities,&quot; Banda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ZDC deputy general secretary said his party will not be tricked by MMD over these negotiations the way they were fooled over last year's &quot;fraudulent&quot; elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nothing short of concrete movements towards resolving the problem of the constitution through a constituent assembly and a complete overhaul of the current electoral regime will suffice,&quot; Banda warned. &quot;Opposition parties who have been calling for dialogue and it is well known that it is the MMD that walkout of the meeting called to address the issue of the constitution and electoral process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Idea invited the ruling MMD and some opposition parties to Stockholm for a Roundtable to initiate an all-parties dialogue which was aborted in May last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MMD was represented by finance minister Ronald Penza, tourism minister Amusaa Mwanamwamba, information and broadcasting minister David Mpamba and the party's deputy national secretary Paul Tembo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNIP was represented by the secretary general Sebastian Zulu, central committee member Rabbison Chongo and special assistant to the party president Muhabi Lungu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Party was represented by secretary general Ludwig Sondashi and the Agenda of Zambia was represented by its president Akashambatwa Mbikusita-Lewanika.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZDC was not represented because Kasuka Mutukwa who had been arranging for the Stockholm meeting had been expelled from the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambian political parties agreed in Stockholm on June10, 1997 to work together and establish a programme of action for sustainable democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of a two day meeting sponsored by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (International IDEA) an agreement was reached to begin dialogue between the government and representatives of the leading opposition parties in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am very excited by this event, the beginning of a dialogue to carry forward the process of democratization,&quot; stated Penza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNIP secretary general Zulu agreed: &quot;I am very pleased with the outcome of this unique round table talks because the interest of Zambia demands that there must be meaningful dialogue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement, which was adopted and signed Tuesday, states that within 21 days the ruling party will initiate an all-party meeting &quot;to establish an agenda programme of action to address sustainable democratic development&quot;. The MMD will initiate the first meeting and a facilitator from international IDEA will be present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new dialogue will focus, inter alia, on questions about the design of the electoral process and ways of increasing the democratic capacity of Zambian institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The process of democratization in Zambia, since the early 90s, has run into a number of obstacles. The largest was the lack of a dialogue between the leading political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the last few months IDEA has played a mediating role in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am extremely pleased that IDEA could play a facilitating role, but the real credit goes to the political parties who have achieved this breakthrough and demonstrated a real example of peaceful conflict resolution,&quot; said IDEA's secretary-general Begt Save-Soderbergh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also present at the round table were representatives of Denmark, the European Commission, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States, UNDP, and the World Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agenda for Zambia president Mbikusita-Lewanika told the Stockholm meeting that &quot;the importance of democratic development and values can not be over emphasised, as an integral part of this dialogue initiative&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Agenda for Zambia and other democratic agents on the Zambian scene want the country to advance on, by first establishing a solid and comprehensive democratic constitutional and electoral regime by a broad national consensus,&quot; Mbikusita-Lewanika said.  &quot;This is what the present Zambia ruling party is being called upon to endorse and facilitate through genuine and inclusivist dialogue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our objection to the constitutional manipulation of 1996 in Zambia is essentially on account of the measures having been taken to reduce rights and freedom of selected victim citizens,&quot; Mbikusita-Lewanika said. &quot;This forum comes after the abortion of an all-party conference which was attempted to try and resolve problems on the constitution and electoral process before the rigged 1996 Elections. There was also an abortion of the ruling party-cum-government proposed one-to-one presidential level dialogue, before the rigged 1996 Elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Issues of any further reformation of the electoral process or of capacity building for political party cannot be undertaken in isolation and outside the frame work of a comprehensive revisiting of the constitution,&quot; Mbikusita-Lewanika said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbikusita-Lewanika told the Stockholm meeting that efforts towards the advancement of political freedom, economic progress and human security need to be applied locally and worldwide.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Cooperation and stability is crucial if trade is to flourish among Southern Africa Development Countries, said President Frederick Chiluba yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Chiluba, receiving Belgium Ambassador to Zambia Leopold Carrewyn's credentials at State House, said that Zambia believed in regional cooperation as a necessary factor in enhancing trade among member countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zambia is committed to political interaction with other countries because, as a nation and a region, it needs a large market through organisations like SADC (Southern African Development Community),&quot; President Chiluba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President noted that lately trade between Africa and Europe has started favouring the former as many countries on the continent were now slowly finding their markets in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Carrewyn lauded the role Zambia was playing in the peace process in central Africa, especially in Angola and the Great Lakes Region, where it has participated in a number of important deliberations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Carrewyn said Belgium's stance on the new Democratic Republic of Congo and President Laurent Kabila was constructive and in favour of a broad based transition government with an eventual free and fair election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe that President Kabila's government should seek, together with the international assistance, a prompt solution on the refugee problem and shed light on the humanitarian situation in eastern Congo,&quot; Ambassador Carrewyn said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Switzerland Ambassador to Zambia, Catherine Kreg Polejack, during the same ceremony, said that her country was aware of the economic problems Zambia was facing and that it would assist in the modest way it could.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Chiluba, in reply, said the Swiss had assisted in Zambia's school rehabilitation programme and Ambassador Polejack's coming to Zambia should help strengthen the two countries relations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - MORE than fourteen candidates for the June 28, Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) executive membership polls will be barred following the anomalies in their nomination papers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FAZ interim executive treasurer Musa Kasonka is among the candidates who are not eligible while Zambia Tender Board boss Teddy Mulonga still tops the list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an inspection of nomination papers conducted in Lusaka last week, Monze businessman Harish Naik like Mulonga used Zanaco treasurer Collins Shamutete to sign his papers while Kasonka falls out of favour because he has not served enough years in soccer administration at club level to back his candidature.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bennet Simfukwe of Nkana Football Club and Donald Mulenga, Profund Warriors chairman are some of the candidates ruled out because they were seconded by 'wrong' people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other names include David Chiti, Peter Nyongani, G. Mwene, A.  Pandor, Ishmail Pandor and Andy Sitali from youth football association who signed the nomination papers for themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This inspection was done in the presence of the acting general secretary of Football Association of Zambia, Mr. Chiluba as per constitutional clause 6. and electrol rules,&quot; reads the statement which was made available to The Post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mulonga and Naik may, however, successfully contest for their positions if FAZ waives the ban following a June 6, letter from Shamutete which indicates that he is acting chairman of Zanaco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FAZ is expected to publish a full list of the successful candidates on Monday, two weeks before the elections in Kabwe at Masiye Motel on June 28 and committee member Kangwa Mutupa is among those disqualified for flauting the electral procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interim president Micheal Chiti is still in contention for the topmost seat with division one south Green Buffalos chairman and former FAZ general secretary Herman Mpashi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the disqualification of Mutupa and Pandor for the vice- presidency, the race is on between City of Lusaka vice-chairman Simon Phiri and former Kabwe Warriors chairman Lasky Mwandu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the treasurer position those still in the running are Charles Mushabati from Ministry of Finance FC, Mwiya Songiso, Sam Phiri (Lusaka Tigers) and Andrea Mtine, Ndola Wanderers boss.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The 24 per cent increase in the price of petroleum products which became effective at midnight on Tuesday will lead to a general escalation of costs throughout the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bus and taxi fares are up by 25 per cent already and that is just the beginning. Virtually all costs will rise and price adjustments to meet that quite massive rise will be unavoidable.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the final analysis it is the costs of living and doing business that will have risen and by more than 24 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question is where does that leave Zambia, a country struggling to attract investment and breathe life into critical sectors of the economy crippled by structural adjustment?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer may be that it leaves the country at least 24 per cent more unattractive for investment now than before that increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Typically, such increases are effected without any serious thought to what obtains in neighbouring countries in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet time has come for Zambia to be a lot more conscious about the economic situation in neighbouring countries. Zambia is in competition with them for the much needed investment as well as bilateral and multilateral assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investors have a choice and are persuaded by other considerations than verbal eloquence and lies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ever spiraling costs in the local economy work against Zambia in favour of those neighbouring countries where the cost of doing business may be lower and economic factors generally are more stable. They will be a more attractive destination for investment and even aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberalisation may mean facing economic realities in the face and responding to them in line with the rules of supply and demand. But it is no license for pricing oneself out of the market or making an economy unattractive for investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While keeping costs artificially low will help nobody, it is in Zambia's interest to proceed with extreme caution in this area.  Both the cost of living and doing business are already high. The infra-structure is in a sorry state and there appears no capacity to repair it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further deterioration in the investment and business atmosphere cannot be in the country's interest. It can only ensure that most of the elaborate plans to attract investment remain a pipe dream and life unaffordable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is therefore wrong to view the increase in the price of petroleum products as just one of those period adjustments which have become part of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It could be a most serious setback for all well laid plans to put the economy back on the rails. It goes to the heart of everything that the country wants to achieve and what may still be on the drawing boards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a measure of the continuing crisis in the management of the economy that the price increase even though having far reaching implications was announced in an off hand manner. It was really a take it or leave it thing .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambians have no choice. They will have to take it. But the investors have and may decide to vote with their feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the real crying need is for more coordinated planning at higher levels so that various efforts are not undermined so easily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But above all there should be a clearer definition of what the country really wants and a more defined way of getting there.  There is little evidence of this at present.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - I write regarding Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) privatisation pronouncements, the looming denial of terminal benefits payments for those who will remain in employment with new investors and an urgent need for ZCCM employees (miners) to unite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is common knowledge that majority of miners are for privatisation of the giant conglomerate to instill discipline at managerial level and lease a new life of viability in the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, miners are not happy with the pronouncements made so far concerning payment of terminal benefits and Mukuba Pension Scheme (Mukuba) due to affected members. Statements from the four stakeholders (actors), viz; ZCCM board, politicians/government, ZPA and MUZ are shifty/inconsistent, hollow, flaccid and cowardly (in the case of MUZ).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is an open fact that only an insane/crooked investor can agree to pay for service not rendered to him/her or else the whole ZCCM privatisation issue is bogus and smells to the core. Where on earth has one heard of a same investor committing himself/herself to services that did not benefit him/her in any way?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, only a trick-star (the likes of Mukuba Trustees) can agree to prevail over the scheme when ZCCM is no more and members/Coy stop contributing to the scheme when exit pension salaries remain static) as at 30 June 1997 as revised when ZCCM will be dissolved.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Going by current developments, therefore, miners must take ZCCM at law, before the case is overtaken by events. My passionate appeal is for miners/MUZ at Divisional level to form ZCCM dissolution division committees that will in turn form the industry committee to spearhead the suing of ZCCM. These committees will discuss issues of mutual interest and agree on an amount of money to be contributed by each miner (K10,000 per U).  Once this money is raised miners should engage more than two law firms to prevail on contentious issues on their behalf, i.e.  payment of terminal benefits and dissolution of Mukuba/payment of Mukuba benefits. In the event of MUZ-Industry being unsupportive of the move it will be the next target for litigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, if some miners are skeptical of the above and want further information before they can move, here are a few highlights for consideration:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) Privatisation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. When Chingola School of Accountancy, Vision Consult and others were privatised all affected employees were given terminal benefits. The issue is not the number of individuals involved but a precedence that has been set. Therefore, why should miners benefits be kept in a Trust Fund as the government is insisting?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. New investors have a tendency of firing employees at will or ditching them if things get touch, e.g. SAMAT at Mufulira, Premium Oil Company's saga, Lonrho, Anglo-American at Zambia Breweries), etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. ILO conventions to which Zambia subscribe protect employees' rights and emphasise payment of benefits when companies change hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. US$4.3 billion will be realised from the sell of ZCCM whilst terminal benefits bill is US$420 million. yet the government tells miners that it can't source for this, which is only one-tenth (1/10) of the amount to be realised from the sell of the mines.  What a gray lie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. Mukuba Pension Scheme</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. When members and ZCCM stop contributing to the scheme, the scheme will cease to be viable since its value will slowly erode due to inflation/payment of salaries that will lead to the Scheme's liquidation and the dilapidated assets will be sold at uneconomical prices where members/beneficiaries will lose out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The board changes rules arbitrary without consulting members, eg. the company is no longer meeting its 10.8 per cent equivalent obligation for each member instead it is only meeting the administration cost of the scheme (revised members handbook - May 1996). this is a condition that was rejected by the Walamba Industry MUZ executive that the current industry MUZ executive has not bothered to challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the absence of MUZ, following dissolution of ZCCM, we expect serious omissions and commissions by the trustees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. It is doubtful if ZCCM was remitting its 10.8 per cent contribution equivalent obligation up to April 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, what members know quite well is that ZCCM has borrowed billions from Mukuba. Money which ZCCM has for sometime now been using to pay miners salaries, bonuses (for the eligible employees) etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Mukuba contributions have been mismanaged. The Board members, trustees/employees of Mukuba, government and other high ranking personalities and institutions have borrowed heavily from the scheme hence the board's reluctance to dissolve the scheme and its stance that members stand to lose if Mukuba is dissolved, assets sold and proceeds distributed proportionately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The Union is happy with the asset base of Mukuba and wants the scheme to survive the privatisation process. unfortunately, some MUZ officials (including those at industry level) are not members of Mukuba. Can these negotiate effectively? Isn't MUZ's future bleak following privatisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. some ZCCM top management officials have pulled out and have paid themselves full benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ongoing negotiations are crucial and are being monitored carefully for tangible results. however, the outcome will not be as is anticipated. The negotiating team is too weak. Therefore, employees should fight for their rights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Inadequate remuneration is undermining the independence of the judiciary, said Law Association of Zambia (LAZ) chairman George Kunda yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kunda, in a press statement released in Lusaka yesterday, said inadequate remuneration has undermined the judiciary to an extent where judges do not feel secure and confident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LAZ chairman, supporting recently gazetted salary increments for Supreme Court and High Court judges, hoped the judiciary will continue dispensing justice fairly regardless of the type of cases and litigants involved.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Judges in Zambia sacrifice a lot and shoulder a heavy responsibility and work load in spite of the inadequate remuneration,&quot; Kunda said. &quot;It is the view of the Association that the current salaries earned by judges cannot attract lawyers in private practice to the bench.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kunda added: &quot;To instill confidence and avoid corruption, judges must be well remunerated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kunda said LAZ has for a long time been concerned about the inadequate &quot;and even scandalous remuneration that has been paid to judges of the High Court and the Supreme Court in Zambia&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kunda condemned &quot;the contemptuous attacks on the judiciary whether in relation to their remuneration or otherwise&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The poorly paid judiciary deserves respect,&quot; Kunda said, adding that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unwarranted attacks of the judiciary will only lower its image and integrity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Frederick Chiluba, through statutory instrument no.  67 of May 28, 1997, increased Supreme Court judges' salaries by more than 207 per cent. Opposition parties are opposed the increase, claiming President Chiluba has bought the judges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nine months ago, judges - through statutory instrument no.140 of August 21, 1996 - were awarded another salary increment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberal Progressive Front chairman, Rodger Chongwe, and National Party secretary general Ludwig Sondashi - both lawyers - urged the judges to reject the salary increment, saying it was a &quot;bribe&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Zambia Democratic Congress President Dean Mung'omba charged that if the judges will accept President Chiluba's &quot;corrupt&quot; salary increment then they should consider themselves &quot;useless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But if they should accept they should consider themselves totally useless and irrelevant to both the political and economic difficulties in this country,&quot; Mung'omba said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Coach Clive Barker and Bafana Bafana have come through a torrid time triumphantly, but there is still much work to be done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Egyptian referee blew his whistle to end the South Africa-Zambia World Cup encounter, national coach Clive Barker must have longed for the solitude of his farm outside Durban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since April, Bafana Bafana have constantly been in the limelight with cup ties against Congo, Zaire and Zambia and high- profile friendlies against England and Holland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The record shows that although South Africa lost three of these matches, they won the two that mattered most - the World Cup clashes with Zaire in neutral Togo and Zambia at FNB Stadium.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barker may have seen a little gloss disappear from what remains a highly successful record in charge, but he is on the verge of leading South Africa into the promised land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A victory or draw at home to Congo on August 16 would take Bafana Bafana to France in June 1998 as one of five African representatives. Nigeria, Tunisia and Morocco have qualified and Cameroon or Angola will fill the other slot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes, Barker, his players and supporters must pinch themselves and wonder if it is all not just one never-ending dream. It seems like yesterday that Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Zambia and Mexico were humiliating us. Of course the heaviest home defeat came only a week ago when the Dutch dished out a football lesson on a freezing Johannesburg evening as they romped to a two-goal victory in a contest between severely weakened teams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that the result could have worried Barker too much as one undisputed strength of the squad he has methodically developed is their ability to bounce back from adversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After consecutive losses in Australia, they became the first national team in 10 years to leave Madagascar triumphant; after losing to Egypt in the Nations Cup, they overcame Algeria to reach the semi-finals. After falling to Brazil in the unforgettable Nelson Mandela Inauguration Challenge, they defeated Malawi at home and away in the World Cup; and after the Congo debacle, they conquered Zaire to get back on track for France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a team mirrors its coach, then this attribute comes as no surprise. Whatever the technical shortcomings of Clive Barker (and his critics have yet to spell them out), the man born 53 years ago in Durban is a fighter and a patriot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He may also have become over sensitive to what he considers &quot;criticism&quot;, but is often nothing more than comment from the print and electronic media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Sunday we were told that Barker had proved his critics wrong. Wrong about what? No two football people, be they coaches, players, officials, members of the fourth estate or supporters, will pick the same 11 to represent Bafana Bafana and that is the way it should be. We are not living in North Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is the veteran soccer journalist who opined last week that Barker should have used fullbacks rather than midfielders in wingback roles a traitor? Rather that honesty than the ill- informed, sycophantic ramblings of certain media members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can understand the occasional annoyance of the coach because when he recently asked one Sunday newspaper reporter what system he used in the Congo, there was no reply, only a deafening silence. Talking of criticism, it would be constructive to note that while Bafana Bafana untimately overwhelmed Zambia, there are weaknesses needing attention in many areas of the team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The quality of crosses is not exactly world class (Sizwe Motaung please note); too many Eric Tinkler passes go to the opposition; and too much &quot;clever&quot; football is being attempted in defensive areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Helman Mkhalele was rightfully taking much of the praise last Sunday, it was the old warhorse, Neil Tovey, who provided some of the most telling contributions, especially the first-half tackle that foiled Kalusha Bwalya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African qualifiers are fortunate to have almost one year to prepare for the finals and presuming Bafana Bafana take at least one point off Congo, Barker and his staff will have time to reflect and react. Teams that qualify for the finals often bear little resemblance to those that play in the finals and it certainly is not inconceivable that players on the fringe of Bafana Bafana selection will force their way in by June 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What qualification will do is heighten awareness of the game throughout the country and the days when Shoes or Doctor could walk unnoticed through most northern suburbs shopping malls will surely end forever.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Springboks are adapting to a new coach and being without some ditched World Cup stars, while the Lions are coming to terms with a new style of play</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we have right now in the build-up towards next Saturday's first Test between the Springboks and the Lions at Newlands, is two potentially good rugby teams trying to come to terms with the way the game - and the circumstances around them - have changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South Africans are slowly coming to the realisation that the marvel of a World Cup win at Ellis Park close on two years ago is history; a catalyst for the future perhaps, but of little help in the immediate present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coach has changed twice since that memorable day when Joel Stransky kicked the heart out of the New Zealanders in extra time.  The analytical mind of Kitch Christie is no longer there for his charges to feed off. The brooding laager mentality of Andre Markgraaff has been summarily lost in a welter of foul-mouthed racism.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead we have the gentlemanly calm of Carel du Plessis, a prince of a player, but, in many respects, a mere pretender to the throne as a fledgling coach who took over the Springboks without having guided a provincial team. Du Plessis has only the evidence of the devastation of Tonga at Newlands earlier this week on which to gauge his dreams of success. And the more cynical would argue that perhaps he would have sustained fewer injuries and more competition against Mpumalanga, even if the province had not suspended both their locks for laying into the Lions with such apparent malice aforethought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Springbok pattern is gradually changing, as first Markgraaff and then Du Plessis have re-staffed the national side, looking for a form of total rugby and discarding the seemingly essential services of World Cup skipper Francois Pienaar, match- winner Stransky, the broken-field mental mastery of Hennie le Roux and the rampaging physical presence of Kobus Wiese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Springboks face the reality of the fact that Bob Dylan had it all too right so many years ago when he warned that the times they are achanging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a state of flux that showed some gaps in the Test against the willing but woefully outgunned Tongans. There was the sight of a Springbok side so totally in control in the first 20 minutes that, like Australian cricket captain Mark Taylor, a century began to look like a very real threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then came the almost arrogant spectacle of them relaxing, slowing down and doing just enough. In the analysis, no All Black side ever chosen would have been guilty of such a lapse. The game, as wily New Zealand captain Sean Fitzpatrick is so wont to observe, is played across a full 80 minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rugby canvas, as painted by the All Blacks, allows no time for pondering which corner to put the signature in, until long after the paint has dried. Du Plessis must realise this and it is an aspect he will surely drill home to his squad before the whistle sounds for the first of three confrontations against the Lions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tourists, too, have some urgent thinking to do about the changing face of the game before they run out in Cape Town. If they don't, they risk the same fate as their lion mascot ... a stuffing. The Lions have struggled to come to terms with both the speed and intensity of the game in the southern hemisphere, and the sheer physicality of it all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is well that both Marius Bosman and Elandre van der Bergh have been heavily fined for the hooligan tactics of Witbank - even if the Mpumalanga officials were rightly forced to act following the strong denunciation of the dirty deeds by Lions manager Fran Cotton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cotton, in his summation of the crippling of Scots lock Doddie Weir, was dead right. This type of play has no place in the game of rugby. Certainly not South African rugby. And this from a man who was never considered a panty-waist angel in his own playing days, as shown by the Lions management refusing an appeal against the one-match ban centre Scot Gibbs earned for over-vigorous use of his fists against Northern Transvaal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One tends to agree with Weir's mother Nan on the R10 000 fine dished out to Bosman. A suspension would have been far more relevant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, sad as the return home of Weir, Paul Greyson and Scott Quinnell through injury may be, Cotton, again, recognised that this aspect is very much a part of a tour of South Africa. What he still has to understand fully - strange this from one of the world's premier front-rankers of his playing era - is that the major problems facing the Lions emanate from the men in the front three.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no possible way that the Lions can win the series unless they sort out their front row. These are, after all, the storm- troops of the game, the foundation of any battle plan. And yet this department of the Lions has seemed to wilt against even the most tepid of opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then few of their props have had to face Auckland, ACT or Wellington on a regular basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without clean ball in the set phases, even a scrumhalf as agile and quick as Robert Howley will struggle to give his backs something decent to work with in the way of flowing ball. The Lions have serious problems in this regard ... and they have yet to face the full might of a Springbok tight five intent on pushing them backwards up the slopes of Table Mountain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To once again use the benchmark of the New Zealand game as the grail modern rugby should aim at, there are no scams in an All Black front row. They come at you like a wall. And the famed &quot;black blanket&quot; of the tight and loose forwards in tandem, devised by Ivan Vodanovich all those years ago, has been refined to an art-form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, the northern hemisphere sides have yet to fully realise.  Tries e and weft of the game, if not the fabric itself, have been very rapid ght be the preserve of the sparkling three-quarters, but games are won and lost in the grind of the engine room. The difference is that it is now done with skill and pace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through the catalyst of Super 12 and the Tri-nation series, the sides of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa - incidentally, the only three sides to have triumphed in the World Cup - the changes in the warp indeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The de-limitation of one man's specific task has, in many instances, blurred into that of another. And while specialisation has not brought us back full circle to the days when the first forward to the scrum took unknown ground named Telkom Park - to square the series against But, hooker's position, and whoever was next filled in as prop, there is a new openness about the ability of forwards to run with the ball in their hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No better illustration of this is necessary than the sight of Springbok tighthead Adrian Garvey coming up with two tries in the rout of Tonga.  You cannot discredit the thinking of Cotton and coach Ian McGeechan in picking the hardest men they could find to make the tour, scouring the ranks of former league players for battle- hardened recruits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lions have begun to change themselves during their tour of this country. They have simply had to allow the silky skills of backs like Jeremy Guscott to engage the opposition.  one feels this change will not be enough and will not come soon enough for them to make any significant impact on the Tests, although this type of long-distance analysis has proved wrong in the past, most significantly in 1955 when the South Africans had to fight their way back in the final Test at Boet Erasmus - a stadium incidentally not far o not expect a massacre in line with that which faced the Tongans, but Robin Thompson's Lions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, even in a state of flux, the Springboks look just that bit too strong, too fast and too well-schooled in the modern thinking in every department.  Traps await Tiger as he chases Grand Slam do not bet too heavily on the British tourists either.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - If Bruce Fordyce was South Africa's Comrades star of the 1980s - and indeed of all time - with his incredible tally of nine victories, South Africa's star of the 1990s is undeniably Shaun Meiklejohn. He may have only one victory in what is a far more competitive era than the days when Fordyce cast a gigantic shadow over his opposition, but Meiklejohn's consistency since 1990 is still remarkable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has never finished out of the top five - although he did miss the 1994 race to concentrate on the 100km world championships where he finished fourth - and on Monday he will again be running his favoured down run.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is perhaps Meiklejohn's economical running style - he covers the ground with a shuffle reminiscent of the great Alan Robb - that gives him an advantage on the down run. The heavy pounding inflicted by running downhill with a more orthodox style takes a heavy toll towards the end of the down run, but there are other factors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I prefer the first hour-and-a-half of the down run to that of the up run because it's all local territory to me,&quot; says Meiklejohn who lives just outside Pietermaritzburg in Hilton. &quot;I don't get to run the first 30km of the up run very often but with the down run a lot of my training is on this section of the course. I'm a lot happier going out of 'Maritzburg and I tend to pace myself well in the opening stages so that when the real downhill section comes I'm still able to run strongly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He will make sure he stays close to the leaders on Monday after being &quot;caught unawares with the pace&quot; last year and intends running a similar race to 1995 when he scored a thrilling victory over Charl Mattheus in the last five kilometres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His preparations too have been similar to those which served him so well in 1995. &quot;If something works for you then why change it? Many things this year compare very favourably with '95. Things like my heart rate, body weight and times for particular sessions are almost identical so I'm hoping that this bodes well for me this year,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although there has been talk of an assault on Fordyce's 1986 down record of 5:24:07, that seems unlikely as the record was set on an 88,6km course and this year the race will be over 89,9km which automatically adds around five minutes to the race.  Meiklejohn won on a 90,7 km course and will be looking to improve on his halfway split of 2:47 in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Times are not his main focus during the race, however.  Meiklejohn writes messages on his wrists for motivation. In 1995 he had the words control and relax painted on either wrist. &quot;I've got away from using times because that keeps you too focused on how fast you are running and where you must be at a particular point. I prefer landmarks and rough estimates and I use my messages to stay focused on the day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What will he write on his wrists on Monday? &quot;I haven't decided yet. I'll decide nearer the time what's going to be my big motivator.&quot; He could do worse than choose repeat and 1995!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Foreign runners are flocking to the Comrades Marathon but the locals are still very much in the rush for gold</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year it was won by a Russian. This year it takes place on June 16, a day remembered for the Soweto uprising of 1976 and now known as Youth Day. Comrades, it would seem, is living up to its name but it is also becoming what it has long claimed to be: the most prestigious and competitive ultra-marathon in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Comrades Marathon has been the world's largest ultra- marathon for many years and has its own unique pomp and ceremony that creates a sense of occasion unequalled in this sector of athletics which generally goes unnoticed in the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the doors were opened to international athletes in 1992 it has also been attracting increasing numbers of the world's best ultra runners. That trend continues this year with what is certainly the strongest field ever assembled for both the men's and women's races. Indeed Comrades is fast approaching de facto world championships status and although the official 100km world championships still attract a deeper elite field, that may not be the case for much longer.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One reason that Comrades is quickly catching up is the ever- increasing value of prize money on offer. It was only in 1995 that the Comrades Marathon Association took a bold step away from amateurism but already the winner's prize has increased by nearly half to R65 000. That may be chicken feed compared to what's available at some of the big city marathons elsewhere, but in the world of ultra running it is the biggest purse by far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Running Comrades, with the vociferous support of thousands of spectators and the captive attention of a whole nation, is also a lot more enjoyable than the lonely and often obscure road that is ultra running in other parts of the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite the foreign onslaught and predictions that South Africans would soon be forced out of the gold medal positions, local athletes have continued to demonstrate that this country produces some of the best ultra runners in the world. Last year there were four overseas athletes in the top 10, the highest number yet, while six of the women's top 10 places were claimed by foreigners, also a record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year the race is as open as ever with winners predictions best left to the foolhardy but many local athletes are expected to be in with a chance of glory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Predictably those three stalwarts - Nick Bester, Shaun Meiklejohn and Charl Mattheus - should feature most prominently.  They have proven themselves consistently in Comrades throughout the 1990s and have the experience that so often proves crucial in this extremely demanding race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mattheus has been training at altitude in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado to try and regain that winning edge which has been so close in the last two years following the disappointment of disqualification when winning the race in 1992 after inadvertently taking medication containing banned stimulants. Whether it was a wise decision to change the training regime that has served him so well in the past will only become evident late on Monday morning, but for Meiklejohn it has been a case of sticking to a tried and trusted formula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meiklejohn has followed a similar programme to the one which saw him become Natal's first winner in 16 years on the last down run two years ago. With an enviable record on the down run he could again prove to be the best tip among the South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nick Bester also took himself away from home to prepare for Comrades but apart from the isolation of Dullstroom in the Eastern Transvaal the altitude was only a few hundred metres higher than what he is used to in Pretoria. Bester can never be ruled out in Comrades and while his best results in recent years have been on the up run - second in 1994 and 1996 - his victorious run of 1991 came on the down run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other South Africans who are expected to do well are Rasta Mohloli who has been in the top four in three out of the last four years, Theo Rafiri, Donovan Wright and Gary Turner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African marathon recordholder Zithulele Sinqe is the dark horse in the pack. It will be Sinqe's first attempt at Comrades and also his final race in an illustrious career which includes a successful defence of his Two Oceans title earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Oceans pedigree, however, does not always translate to the Comrades - Two Oceans recordholder Thompson Magawana could manage no better than fifth - but the fact that Sinqe is a novice certainly does not count against him either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Winners Dmitri Grishine (1996), Alberto Salazar (1994) and Charly Doll (1993) have all shown in recent years that it is possible to win at the first attempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the foreign legionnaires, last year's American ultra runner of the year, Tom Johnson, is one of the favourites, as is last year's winner Dmitri Grishine of Russia. Alexei Volgin - third for the last two years - is another Russian who can go all the way and with world 100km record- holder Konstantin Santalov and newcomer Igor Ryabov also in the starting line-up, the Russians have the talent to make a real impact this year.  Germany's Kaziemierz Bak, Poland's Jaroslaw Janicki and Andrzej Magier and Britain's Christopher Parkes are other overseas athletes who could feature on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the women's race there seems little prospect of a South African challenging for the title with a group of four high- profile international athletes seemingly in a league of their own.  The world's top female ultra runner, American Ann Trason - who holds the 100km world record and set an up run course record when winning Comrades last year - is not expected to win this year, though.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trason underwent surgery on a ruptured hamstring in November and has only been in training for two months. She may not be strong enough yet to win the race but she could still carry too much firepower for the South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany's Maria Bak - the winner in 1995 - and Russia's Valentina Shatyaeva are the two favourites, with 1994 winner Valentina Liakhova of Russia also in the running. South Africa's best bet seems to lie with Pretoria's Helene Joubert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether it was a wise decision to change the training regime that has served him so well in the past will only become evident late on Monday morning, but for Meiklejohn it has been a case of sticking to a tried and trusted formula.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pedi men are noticeable because their traditional dress consists of Scottish kilts. Before the Pedi start dancing and singing, Baba Dlamini introduces them and explains the kilts ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1878 the British colonial leader, Sir Theophilus Shepstone, advanced north towards the Pedi after defeating the Zulus under Cetshwayo. The Pedi leader, Sekhukhune, had just fought against the Afrikaners and beaten them. Shepstone demanded 2 000 head of cattle from the Pedi. Sekhukhune handed over only 200, later raising this to 245, plus some elephant tusks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shepstone wasn't happy about it and when Major General Garnet Woolsey arrived, the soldiers went about conquering the Pedi to take their land. The story goes that the men in the front ranks of the advancing British army were wearing kilts, which fooled the Pedi into thinking they were women - so they did not shoot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was too late when they realised they were not ladies,&quot; says Dlamini, and the Pedi lost the war. Then the Pedi men decided they liked the kilts, which were given to them by the Scottish regiment as part of a reconciliation pact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Peter Delius of Wits University's history department has studied the Pedi for over 20 years and has written two books on Pedi history (The Land Belongs to Us and A Lion amongst the Cattle). He has not heard this version of the kilt story, which he describes as a lovely &quot;tall story, but a good one&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delius does say that he's heard the Pedi saw British in kilts and there might have been Scottish regiments around at that time, or at the time of the Boer War (1899 to 1902). He says that at the time of the war against the British the Pedi shot back &quot;like hell, and were doing well until the Pedi stronghold was pinned down by the Swazi army. So the Pedi were clobbered from the rear by them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interesting as the story told to me at Lesedi is, I can't help wondering what's going on. If Jews adopted Nazi outfits after World War II, wouldn't it be questioned? Dr Julian Cobbing of Rhodes University's history department says that the Pedi were beaten by the British, and then subjected to colonial control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sekhukhune was exiled and assassinated and the Pedi were demilitarised and turned into forced labourers. Why would they want to take on the dress of those responsible for this? Cobbing says that if a conquered nation assumes the dress of the conqueror it does represent somewhat of &quot;a prostration of the conquered&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Deborah James, an anthropology lecturer at Wits, did her thesis on South African dress, dance and ritual. She says kilts do form part of Pedi costume, but she dates this as having started during World War II, not before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the kilts, men wore thetwana - skirts made of animal skin. Some dancers James spoke to said they saw the Transvaal Scottish regiment wearing kilts in the 1950s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She says it's likely the kilt is used for dancing because of the way it twirls and flips, and because it looks &quot;smart, beautiful and regimental. The men are expressing a kind of military ethic. It's a combination of modern military with a harking back to the glorious days of (Sekhukhune's) Pedi empire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what of the story of the mistaken belief that the Scottish soldiers were women? Who came up with that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James says this story should be told, as long as it is recognised as a myth. &quot;There are so many myths around. It doesn't mean they don't count. They show us what people are thinking. This story could be a comment on gender relations and colonial relations. Myths arise because they say something. They might not be true but they might be pertinent.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Steady shifts are happening as mainstream South African radio hones in on an increasingly competitive market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perception is reality, reality is a mind thing, and minds tend to change. Understand this principle and you'll get a handle on the law governing 702-land and the drastic programme changes that took place on air last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law is also called Stan Katz, the chief executive officer of Primedia and head of Radio 702. The law operates according to a mercurial set of principles based on the three &quot;M&quot;s of successful management: media, markets, money. And it emanates from a head that, at times, seems to consist of 99% vision, 1% process.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But right now the vision is less revolutionary than reactive.  It stems from an intensive 18-month market research campaign involving 23 000 questionnaires, 5 000 telephone interviews, and a thorough brand audit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The diagnosis: while Radio 702 listeners are not against mental floss, they want more froth. For a pain-racked, emotionally desensitised society, paparazzi appear to be the principal balm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But research also shows that Radio 702's racial integration programme initiated in those heady, early post-apartheid days, has developed a limp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simunye (unity) is about as real as the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow nation. Black listenership on Radio 702 is down from 35% to 30%, although Katz dismisses the racial statistics as random and &quot;scientifically invalid&quot;. He says these ratings fluctuate with each survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the end of last week, the thorough repositioning of South Africa's most successful commercial station was well under way.  Talk show hosts Chris (Gibbons) on late afternoon news and Dan (Moyane) on the breakfast show were out. Jenny (Crwys- Williams), John (Robbie, Qwelane and Berks) and David (O' Sullivan) were in.  According to the press statements, it all happened quite seamlessly. But one or two staffers told a different story. They referred to Katz as &quot;Stantrum&quot;. He was clearly having a bad head week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week the mood was more upbeat. &quot;People are afraid of change,&quot; said Katz in an interview this week. &quot;It was like this when we shifted from a music station to a talk radio. Everyone thought it was the end of the world. But once you take charge and steer, they make the adjustment.&quot; Katz is clearly not a consensus man. His way makes either for magnificent success or ignominious failure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And sometimes perception and reality make incompatible bedfellows. The broad perception is that Radio 702, instead of being a trendsetter had become a follower. The &quot;media rebel without a pause&quot; has been pressured into toning down its &quot;rock'n'roll without the music&quot; in favour of the soft shoe shuffle. The question is why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Radio 702 was first launched in 1980, the independent radio station was the proverbial new kid on the block, speaking with a powerful opposition voice to the apparatchiks at the SABC under apartheid. But by 1990, the political sands had shifted.  Simunye was the buzzword. Even the SABC eschewed its role as ventriloquist dummy in favour of the new non-racial order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Govin Reddy was the architect of change at SABC radio's flagship transformation mission: Radio South Africa became SAfm and braved a stormy public as it set about integrating its airwaves. Despite initial teething troubles and complaints about bad news accents from irate listeners hankering for the days of Jan Smuts, his plan seems to have worked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today SAfm enjoys a substantially increased black listenership.  The reason given by acting station manager Michael Ford is that SAfm provides essential information for the emerging black elite on international affairs and foreign trade. &quot;It is important to understand that the idea of integration was more a projection than a reality when it was initiated,&quot; he explains. &quot;And it is essentially a long term goal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Radio 702, which had always positioned itself against the SABC, took a slightly different route: &quot;When you fight a guerrilla war and win you suddenly become the establishment,&quot; says Katz.  &quot;Radio 702 has tried to maintain the difference between being established and establishment. We saw a role for ourselves in the transition as a forum for people from opposite poles. We tried to pair presenters with very different historical experiences. After the elections we became more issue driven.&quot; But the dangers of talk radio are that audiences tend to talk too much. After a while, open lines become an open sesame for all opinions, no matter how inane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The market's need for pure information is higher than before,&quot; explains Katz. &quot;That's why, although we don't want to lose our hard news, confrontational edge, we will be broadening our base to include more international coverage, and of course, entertainment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many respects Katz is adhering to global trends. Saturated with horror stories, the rest of the world has shifted from confrontationalism to passive consumption. The please-all populist approach is out. Niche markets are in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And 18 months into the truly new South Africa there is a more sober perception of reality. Euphemistically put, the simunye concept remains in the realm of wishful thinking. Radio 702 has shifted from the &quot;straddle all interest groups&quot; position to address a more specific market. Race is not the issue. Ratings are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We still take the government to task, but our advertisers are targeting the upper end of the super-income earners. They want to cater to the top 10% of the market,&quot; says Katz. &quot;Essentially we are a business funded by advertising. But this does not make us mercenary in approach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the interim, Primedia, which owns Radio 702, has swooped on the burgeoning local commercial radio industry, making it one of the most powerful media cartels in the country. Together with Zerilda, a consortium consisting of trade unions and women's investment groups, it has scooped 40% of Highveld Stereo via Africa on Air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its most recent commercial coup has been the purchasing of Publico publishing company, which owns 24% of Lanella Broadcasting, in which the Mail &amp; Guardian also has an interest and of which former M&amp;G editor Anton Harber is now managing director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now former bad boys on the block are consorting with politicians and power mongers. Stan Katz has been likened to South Africa's version of Rupert Murdoch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But power comes with a price tag. You do not bite the hands that feed you. And you learn than on talk radio, nothing talks like money.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Brightly coloured tights and tutus worn by children grinning like Cheshire cats seem almost surreal in the dusty streets and squalor of the Cape Flats, where the Cape Town City Ballet (CTCB) have established their Dance for All project.  It's at moments like these that one truly realises the original meaning of those well worn phrases &quot;cultural diversity&quot; or, even worse, &quot;rainbow nation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Classical ballet is possibly the pinnacle of western &quot;high art&quot; and here it is, not from the Bolshoi or Sadler's Wells, but from a battered Masakhane Hall in NY1 Guguletu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philip Boyd is the dynamo behind this outreach project - for which he won the Nederburg ballet prize last week - and his dream is to make the Masakhane Hall a thriving, pulsating centre for dance and all the performing arts. When he retired from the stage after 20 years he decided to devote his energies to dance education. His passion and personal involvement with his work has led him and his wife, former prima ballerina Phyllis Spira, to foster Theo Dindwa, one of the children in the project.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theo (14) is studying ballet as a school subject for matric and also attends the University of Cape Town (UCT) ballet school. He has just pirouetted away with top awards at the recent Cape Town eisteddfod.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am a workaholic,&quot; says Boyd, &quot;and I care for the future of ballet in this country.&quot; Why did he leave the luxuries of retirement from a demanding stage career to hit the dusty roads of the townships with the ballet gospel? &quot;Dance is a language we all understand,&quot; says Boyd. &quot;There is talent out there and we can build bridges between cultures. It also takes the kids off the streets and gives them something to do. There is very little that stimulates their minds and we are offering an opportunity for them to grow and develop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project is in its fifth year and has been financed mostly by a trust set up by former UCT ballet school professor and director of the former Capab ballet, David Poole. He was the one who encouraged his students to go out to the townships and give classes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, according to Boyd, &quot;the students were not doing this because they loved it, but as part of their course. They lacked experience and were not well-equipped.&quot; It was then that he approached current CTCB director Veronica Paeper, and established a formal education programme that supports 200 children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such programmes often run into problems because communication barriers mean that the artistic needs of the community they are trying to help are not adequately addressed. &quot;I have never felt antagonised by the community in Guguletu,&quot; says Boyd. The only thing that he has had to convince the people of is that the arts can be a viable profession. Boyd is at pains to explain that &quot;entertainment is an industry. There's so much talent in these children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this is more than just kids learning a pas de deux. It's an effort to give a community its pride and to produce children with minds that can tackle life's challenges. &quot;Parents are thrilled with the programme,&quot; Boyd says with some excitement. &quot;They are glad their children aren't running in the street.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's all well and good to expose children to ballet, but how much of traditional African art forms are they being exposed to?  &quot;We have an African dance teacher and a drummer who are part of the programme,&quot; says Boyd. &quot;We're not out there specifically to create ballet dancers - although that's welcome. We're there to teach the kids self-confidence so they can respond positively to the testing demands of their future professions.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The biggest art shows in the world get under way this month. Brenda Atkinson on William Kentridge, South Africa's most notable player</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are few South African artists who can claim as expansive a career curve as William Kentridge, nor as consistently impressive a body of work. It seems that 1997 will consolidate his international status - he is involved in no fewer than 10 projects, including a play, Ubu, which is to tour 12 European countries in the second half of the year; an opera; and a solo show at San Diego's Museum of Contemporary Art.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As South Africa prepares for the second Johannesburg Biennale in October this year, Europe's summer months are sprouting more exhibitions and art fairs than you can cram into a calendar.  Venice, Kassel, Munster and Nantes, among others, will see a vast influx of international culturati over the next few months, and a flood of critical writing about their political achievements and errors. Kentridge will take part in Nantes, along with a strong South African contingent that includes Deborah Bell and Robert Hodgins.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is also the only South African artist who will show at Kassel's Documenta X - considered one of the more seriously intellectual European contemporary art events - and as such, a significant locus for international attention. Director Catherine David has selected him not as a representative of South Africa - Documenta X has no national pavilions - but as an artist whose work merits attention, regardless of its national origin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biennales are strange and intriguing events. As the primary showcases for international contemporary art, they pick up on the private and public political moments of the countries in which they occur. They generate competition and exposure, offer crucial networking opportunities for artists and curators, and require vast amounts of money to manage. They are also frequently afflicted by confused - and confusing - cultural agendas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Kentridge acknowledges that, in European terms, Documenta X &quot;carries a lot of clout&quot;, he's disinclined to drop other work to produce specifically for a context in which he is not commercially involved. But he also finds South Africa frustrating in that the local art world tends to produce with domestic limitations in mind. &quot;We have a small group of collectors here,&quot; he says, &quot;and people most often buy for domestic interiors, which limits the size and nature of the works produced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's easier in those foreign countries where state subsidies and stronger commercial infrastructure for art allow greater creative freedom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Linda Givon, owner of the Goodman Gallery, and in whose stable of artists Kentridge has been for 10 years, says that South African artists are too fixated on international credibility.  &quot;When our artists have an international show they forget about home,&quot; she explains. &quot;They forget that this is the flower pot and the fertiliser, and we have a responsibility to establish a viable culture for artists, dealers, and the like. The fact that William's work has greater recognition abroad than at home is a problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The need to pursue international legitimation whilst coming to terms with local art-historical tradition is one that seems characteristic of South African artistic production in particular, and most artists find it hard to strike a satisfying balance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of his own international success, Kentridge is pragmatic, concentrating as much on his passions as on opportunities for exposure. His video installation, or &quot;drawings for projection&quot;, at Documenta X will consist of Felix in Exile, made in 1994, and The History of the Main Complaint, made last year, only partly with Documenta X in mind. The decision has also allowed him to concentrate on Ubu, which he currently considers his primary - and very organic - project. The adaptation of Alfred Jarry's play, scripted by University of the Western Cape art historian Jane Taylor, and based on transcripts from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, pulls the original into the contemporary South African context with a deeply surreal spin.  Ubu, which showcased in Johannesburg recently, will have its European debut in Weimar in June, just as Documenta X begins its 100-day run. Unfortunately, South African presence at Havana, Kassel and Nantes this year has done little to soften the hard fact that the Department of Arts and Culture has found itself unable to pull off one of its most important tasks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An embarrassing and curiously opaque administrative bungle has meant that South Africa will not be represented at Venice, the oldest - and for many the most prestigious - Biennale in the world. It's a worrying omission given our lengthy absence from events of this calibre, and the sense that South Africa's &quot;flavour of the month&quot; status in international art circles is facing the dusk of its post-1994 glory days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Givon blames a top-heavy local administrative structure for the scuttling of Venice. &quot;Biennales have immense value for networking,&quot; she says, &quot;which is very important for our artists and curators, particularly given years of isolation from other developing countries.&quot; She is also less than impressed with the modus operandi of the Johannesburg Biennale, which in her opinion has been shrouded in secrecy. &quot;They'll say it's funding,&quot; she says, &quot;but it's also because there are more directors on board than staff members.&quot; For all the controversy that surrounded the first Johannesburg Biennale in 1995, Givon feels that everyone had a sense of what was going on, that &quot;at least there were meetings and sarmies!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Givon will not be offering her impressive new gallery for use as an official Biennale space - instead, Pat Mautloa and David Koloane have a show in the pipeline called If You Scratch, which will move to the Goodman after its run at Grahamstown. As a dealer and gallery &quot;co-ordinator&quot;, Givon says she has a responsibility to her artists, and is averse to entering a commercial hiatus to support a Biennale she thinks of as being rude to its local constituency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kentridge, who will work with Korean curator Yu Yeon Kim at the Johannesburg Biennale, has little to say about its political workings or viability, other than that he hasn't &quot;been very close to it&quot;. He is concerned about the degeneration of the Newtown Cultural Precinct and doesn't have much of a sense of the shape the Biennale will finally take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 1995 Biennale, he says although there was no sense of immediate results, these have become apparent over time. Most of the projects he's now involved in internationally have emerged as a result of foreign visitors seeing his work here - something he takes as an encouragement to &quot;go on working in a fairly idiosyncratic way&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's lengthy absence from world cultural events has nurtured both an emergent sense of identity and a hunger for international credibility. The latter might well have to take a back seat as we begin to clear the political and administrative mess that seems to clutter our own back yard.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A masterful radio documentary, The Story of June 16th, begins with a police loudhailer: &quot;This gathering under section 48 of the Internal Security Act is defined as a riotous gathering and you are all ordered to disperse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the sound of gunfire laid over the background, the then minister of justice Jimmy Kruger is asked to defend police actions on the fateful day to overseas critics. He says: &quot;In all honesty, any objective observer will concede that the police haven't exceeded, as far as we know, any of the powers they should have exercised. I think in all fairness to the South African Police one should rather feel thankful for the way they handled this and the way they have managed to calm the feelings of Soweto.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What follows is a moving first-hand account of the shocking events of the day made up into an audio montage of onlookers and participants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme, due to air nationwide on SAfm on June 16 is a co-production between the Ulwazi educational radio project and BBC's Radio 4. Siven Maslamoney, director of Ulwazi, says the non- profit organisation was set up through the South African Institute for Distance Education and Britain's Overseas Development Agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our aims are to train young black producers and use radio as a medium for mass education, but, saying that, our entire approach is non-didactic. We don't 'teach' on the radio, rather we use real stories of real people to get something across,&quot; says Maslamoney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To date, the project has produced over 120 programmes, ranging from Stimela, a show about migrant labour, to this week's upcoming June 16 21st anniversary programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The production is a flawless montage of interviews, with music and sound effects propping the background. It has no script and no presenter, instead it's a documentary based on real-life experiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is direct and is compulsive listening. One of the powers of radio is that it lets the imagination run, and through the personal accounts of people who lived through that day, the ears keep feeding the brain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The collation of interviews begins with the background to the student demonstrations against Afrikaans as a medium of instruction in schools. Almost everyone relates that that Wednesday was an ordinary winter morning and that when the march began moving from school to school in Soweto the students were remarkably disciplined and peaceful. It was a leisurely and controlled march, but an overwhelming tension grew as the gathering police waited for the students to defy them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are moving accounts of the death of Hector Pieterson, the spark that ignited the chaos that would eventually lead to political uprisings on a nationwide scale. Journalist Sophie (Tema) Mosimane recalls the young boy dressed in a green jersey with yellow stripes and wearing only one shoe. It was her car that was used to transport Pieterson to the clinic, where he was found dead on arrival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What emerges through various people's testimonies is that, after one killing, everything degenerated into a state of anarchy, with government offices, bottle stores, beer halls, administration offices, houses and trucks being ransacked and burnt by a crowd of youths who became vengeful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But probably the most moving parts of this radio programme are the insights into the day's events from parents of the school children. Many mothers left their places of work early, after they heard reports of the riots, and they speak of their journeys home, witnessing the anger, chaos and bloodshed. One woman says: &quot;After that day, you stopped being a child to your parents. You had to become a fugitive and leave your home and leave your school.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What finally emerges is the need to commemorate the loss of loved ones as well as the need to celebrate the energy of those young people and the democratic victory that's come out of the suffering of that catalytic day. The real virtue of the programme is that it refuses to be bitter or vitriolic. Rather, it is a sad and humanising account of real lives, parents and children who were forced to change their destinies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Treaties are stealthily being enacted to empower transnational companies to take financial decisions out of the democratic arena, political theorist Noam Chomsky warned in a speech to the University of Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Globalisation is not all that it is claimed to be. It is punted to be about the miracles of the markets - and all we can do is submit; we have no choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you consider trade flows, investment flows and other standard measures of global interaction, the global economy is almost what it was in 1913. That's the globalisation paradigm.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider the Third World characteristics, particularly in the United States and Britain, but extending elsewhere. These countries are so rich, they don't look like Brazil and Haiti, but the structural characteristics are similar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the US, for example, the stock market is booming, benefiting people who own shares. Half the stock is held by the top 1% of the population and virtually all the rest by the top 10%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, about 80% of the general population has experienced either stagnation or simply decline - in services as well as straight income. They also have longer working hours and Third- World maladies, such as 20% child poverty and about 30-million people going hungry, many literally starving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is essentially developing is a Third World in a rich society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gross measures of globalisation don't indicate anything dramatically new. There are changes, however. One has to do with free movement of labour - a crucial tenet of free-trade theory.  There was a considerable amount of movement of labour in the early part of the century. That's not counted, because it involves people, not profits. But, if we break the rules, there's been a serious decline in globalisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What about capital flow? Relative to gross national product (GNP), it's not very different from what it was before World War II. The big change took place in the early 1970s, when Richard Nixon dismantled the UK system of capital exchange. This imposed a 10% surcharge and was harmful to the US economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When this was done, about 10% of capital exchanges were speculative. About 90% were related to the real economy, trade and investment. By 1990, those figures had reversed. It was 90% speculative, 10% real- economy related. By the last figures given out by the United Nations for 1994, it was 95% speculative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amount has grown astronomically - it's now probably more than a trillion dollars a day, totally overwhelming the combined reserves of all industrial countries. Furthermore, 80% of all those transactions have a round-trip period of a week - meaning you invest and get it right back within a week, and most of that is within one day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capital has to be allowed to leave the country. Industrial economies have never allowed capital flow until they were very well-established. Japan bartered flatly into the 1970s, and that still remains the case. Countries such as Chile and South Korea still have strong capital controls. In Korea, the restrictions were so strong that you could get the death penalty for circumventing them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you look at Latin America and East Asia, they diverged sharply in the 1980s. Up until then they were developing more or less at the same rate. One major factor is that Latin America has no capital controls. So the capital flow out of Latin America in the 1980s was enormous, similar to the level of the Latin American debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That didn't happen in South Korea and Taiwan because they don't allow it. There the state is powerful enough to control the rich as well as the poor. And the effect is that they don't have a debt crisis, they maintain capital internally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are not exotic methods. There is a major effort under way to eliminate them. That is one of the primary goals of the so- called free trade agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) or an even more significant one in the wings, which will be hitting us like a sledgehammer in a year or two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the goals of all these agreements is liberalising finance, which means taking financial decisions out of the arena of democratic politics, out of the arena of public policy and placing them in the hands of unaccountable private tyrannies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The multinational agreement on investments, the most important of all, is now on a dual path, partly at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and partly at the World Trade Organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the organisation it is being impeded because Third World countries, India and Malaysia particularly, are objecting vociferously. They don't want to become wholly owned subsidiaries of a few foreign corporations. The OECD is different. There it will go through without any interference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan was to have it enacted this May. That was slowed down and it is now aimed at next May. The idea is to make it a treaty.  If you lock countries into treaties it is very hard to get out of such arrangements, even if you have the terrible catastrophe of a democratic election or something like that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The drafts are technically available. The plans are to allow free movement of assets, both productive and financial, without any control. That means that the threat of job flight can be used to undermine strikes and labour organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than half of union organising efforts in the US are now undermined simply by the threat of movement of production elsewhere, usually Mexico. That's tripled since Nafta, and it also means an attack on social policy, if you can move assets freely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local ownership won't be allowed; technology-sharing won't be allowed; neither will local managers, corporate accountability, living wage procedures, preferences for deprived areas, like targeting underdeveloped areas, preferences for minorities, for women; marketing restrictions on dangerous products, small business protection, labour, consumer, environmental protection - all of that is ruled out on grounds of investor rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are no restrictions on investments in countries with human rights violations, like Burma. Corporations and investors are given free reign to sue governments down to the local level.  But there are no reciprocal rights. So governments and individuals cannot sue corporations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the main outline for the multilateral agreement on investment. Once the OECD has agreed to it, the Third World has no choice. No country can survive with these markets and economic and military power opposed to them. Well, that's a change from 1913.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another change is the nature of the transitional corporations that dominate the global economy. About half of what is now called trade is actually intra-firm, meaning internal to a particular single corporation. So Ford moves things across the border to Mexico for re-assembly and moves them back to add more value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Internal transactions of that kind give many devices for market interference. It's ridiculous to call it trade. So actual trade is probably about half and is itself highly subsidised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transnationals rely heavily on their home country for markets, public subsidies, protection from risk and so on. There are international transactions, including the ones that are mislabelled trade. These are overwhelming within the triad - Japan, the US and Western Europe. About 75% of all transactions are internal to the triad and when you look at the strategic alliances now taking place, another major device for undermining trade market principle is the alliance between the major corporations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, for example, IBM, Siemens and Toshiba, the three major computer manufacturers in the triad, are now working together to develop chips because it's too costly to compete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What this means is that the so-called globalisation is taking place overwhelmingly in Europe, the US and Japan. And it's mostly internal to mega-corporations, which are linked to one another and highly dependent on their own states for subsidy, socialisation of risk and for markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within the triad, political measures are available, just by existing devices. Parliamentary devices exist to change anything, without fear of military coups and so on. The purpose of the treaty is precisely to prevent that danger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, the whole system of private tyranny, the existence of corporations, is a very modern development. In the US, it happened early this century. Before that, corporations had no rights. They were partnerships and restricted to particular actions determined by state charter. That changed early in this century, not by legislation but by courts and lawyers - the international community played its role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These institutions were given extraordinary rights that they never had before. But the point is the whole system is not graven in stone. It can be overturned, just as other forms of totalitarianism have been overthrown by formal mechanisms that are readily available.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Communists in South Africa have started a passionate debate with religious leaders, writes Vishwas Satgar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All things solid melt into thin air.&quot; Applying this Marxist nomenclature to the South African Communist Party (SACP) reveals a political organisation grappling with the oldest left-wing political legacy in South Africa and Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SACP is on a path-breaking historical journey. Enabling this is the collapse of the authoritarian, bureaucratic socialism of the former Soviet Union, and the emergence of a democratic order in South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Essentially the SACP today is fundamentally rethinking Marxist politics, thus ensuring a disengagement from - a &quot;melting&quot; of - Soviet orthodoxy. It is trying to forge an original, South African path to socialism, which is humane, tolerant and self-critical, and rooted in the democratic order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, the SACP is still an outsider in the new South Africa. It is still construed as an &quot;insurgent voice&quot; rather than a democratically acceptable political formation within a pluralist political system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To a large extent the political vilification and demonisation of the SACP, during the days of apartheid still prevails in the political imagination and the minds of the mass media. It is perceived to be undemocratic in its political ambitions, anti- religious and the harbinger of some kind of foreign agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the rooi gevaar mentality of the media, the SACP has been &quot;melting&quot; in the real world. For discerning political observers it is apparent the SACP is still one of the fastest growing communist parties in the world. It has among its members at least four Cabinet ministers, over 80 MPs, about two premiers, and numerous provincial MECs and members of provincial parliaments and local government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They continue to play a pivotal role in the realisation of democracy in South Africa, in which individual liberties are protected and political opposition (including the semi- moribund National Party) have continued to exist unharassed or politically unintimidated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further contributing to the &quot;melting&quot; of the rooi gevaar was a recent inter-faith seminar, hosted by the SACP, with representatives of the religious community. This event marked the turning point of an ideological re-reading of Karl Marx that began about five years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this time, one of the main theoretical contributions was by Charles Villa-Vicencio (a professor of religion at the University of Cape Town), and the other by the late Joe Slovo. It was Villa- Vicencio's theoretical interrogation and reading of the Marxist maxim, &quot;religion is the opium of the people&quot; that largely contributed to a more broad- minded understanding of religion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not only did he contextualise this crude rejection by the youthful Marx as an opposition to the oppressive and illusory role religion played within capitalist development, but at the same time pointed to a more developed criticism by Marx, which picked up on the potential for liberation within religion. He recognised that Marx was willing to contemplate an ideological role for religion as a protest against suffering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Picking up on this ideological breakthrough was Joe Slovo, who found religion and socialism shared core values like co- operation, human equality, sharing and liberating hope. At the kernel of this was an understanding that a Christian could be a socialist, and an atheist in theory can be akin to a Jesus in practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Digesting this newfound ideological conception of religion, the SACP has ventured into the &quot;new&quot; South Africa without any dogmatic prescription about religious affiliation or spiritual disposition.  Reflecting this ideological stance was Charles Nqakula, general secretary of the SACP, who, in his opening comments of the inter- faith seminar, explicitly asserted, &quot;the SACP is not anti- religious&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants from the different faiths shocked their radical hosts by critically asserting that &quot;free-market&quot; globalising capitalism was not an alternative for humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stiaan van der Merwe, a Christian liberation theologian, pointed out how Christian fundamentalism buttressed the apartheid state, while progressive Christians confronted the truth or &quot;Kairos&quot; of apartheid South Africa and aligned themselves with the struggle of the oppressed and exploited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the failure of Soviet socialism, Chief Rabbi Cyril Harris raised the question: &quot;Do we make capitalism more compassionate or do we make communism work?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swami Agnivesh asserted the need for an anti-imperialist alternative that not only meant changes to socio-economic structures, but also the development of a &quot;revolutionary&quot; practice anchored within the poorest of the poor and guided by a non- dogmatic socialist spirituality yoked to the pursuit of truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All participants made a call for a paradigm shift so that humanity was placed at the centre of social change and development. In a South African sense, the religious leaders were speaking about the need to have a morality and moral leadership, which recognises that crime as well as poverty denigrates the human condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of this seminar, Philip Dexter, the SACP respondent, realised he was not speaking to a right-wing religious fundamentalist panel. Besides disagreeing with the option of giving capitalism a more humane value system, Dexter motivated passionately for ongoing dialogue with progressives in the religious sector.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In the intellectual sense there is something about our Deputy President, Thabo Mbeki, which reminds us of Baroness Orczy's hero: &quot;We seek him here, we seek him there ...  that damned elusive Pimpernel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again this week we had a fleeting glimpse of the man who, for all intents and purposes, is running South Africa. But his Budget speech left us familiarly impressed by his eloquence, confused by his argument and in the final analysis grasping for the substance of the man.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was much in his speech with which we agree. The question he poses, as to whether we are truly a rainbow nation, or &quot;merely a collection of communities, which happen to inhabit our geopolitical position&quot;, is one that must constantly challenge us.  His attack on those who would address the fundamental inequities of South African society &quot;through mere rhetoric&quot; is a timely warning against a dangerous mood of complacency, which is settling on the more advantaged among us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the deputy president goes much further. Assertions are being made, he declares, that declining standards in government are due to the inefficiency of blacks: &quot;In reality, we are not far from the day when the diplomatic language will slip and the point will be made openly that 'the Bantus are not yet ready to govern'.&quot; Corruption, he claims, is also being portrayed as &quot;endemic to African governance&quot; and as such &quot;only three years old in South Africa&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is difficult to discover the source of such assertions. They are certainly not to be discovered in the columns of this newspaper: last week we dealt with corruption at the white- controlled KWV, this week with a white official who stole R8- million from a low-income housing project in Gauteng. We are no apologists for the National Party, but we would hazard that even FW de Klerk would not identify with the attitudes decried by the deputy president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So why did Mbeki put up these straw men? Is he playing the race card in order to rally Africanist support? Or have we misunderstood him ? These are the riddles of the Black Pimpernel.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Will the airship called Nelson ever get off the ground? It'll be surprising if it does, writes Dawn Blalock</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jonathan Hamilton has a dream: to transport people in gas- filled airships. Others suggest he is full of hot air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 31-year-old Sandton entrepreneur is the founder of The Hamilton Airship Company, a business he formed to design and build airships - the blimp-like floating ships with a rigid internal structure first developed by Count Zeppelin in Germany early this century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Hamilton has never actually flown in an airship, his business plan seems more like a personal fantasy - but he thinks enough people will be keen on the idea to ensure a profitable business.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are tired of being transported. People want to travel,&quot; he says, explaining why passengers would choose his slower and more cumbersome means of travel over modern options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Travel in an airship will be like riding in the first-class section of an airplane with a five-star hotel and restaurant for a gamewatching or sightseeing trip, he says. He paints a vivid picture: &quot;You're sitting 500m above the ground. Someone brings you a drink and you watch the world go by.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back on earth, however, Hamilton is having problems. The accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young, originally involved in Hamilton's fundraising, has pulled out of the project. The firm won't say why, but other accountants suggest it was uncomfortable with Hamilton's forecast returns to lure investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Financial analysts scoff at the figures Hamilton detailed in his prospectus. He is also being sued for R1-million for his earlier airship ventures. And he conceded this week that the venture, due to launch early next year, has so far raised less than R1-million. It needs R85-million, but Hamilton is relying on a so far unnamed American group to pump in $25-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The planned maiden voyage is a 10-day trip from Johannesburg to New York. Hamilton plans to sustain it by selling the media rights for R20-million. So far, he has had one booking inquiry for the Nelson, as the proposed airship has been christened. Hamilton plans to co-pilot the Nelson; he just needs to get his flying licence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for his qualifications to build airships, Hamilton says he has an IQ of 173 and could read and write at the age of three. His profile in the company's prospectus states he was admitted to Mensa, the club for people with high IQs, at the age of 12.  Anyway, says Hamilton, &quot;Airships are very simple. It's not rocket science.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, it proved less than simple to keep Hamilton's previous venture afloat. The first, and only, airship he designed and built flew for all of 24 hours before it crashed and was destroyed at the Rand Show last year. Lloyd's of London paid out R750000 of a R1-million policy, Hamilton says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Telkom, which was advertising on the side of the airship, was not happy about its downed campaign. It has a R1-million court case pending against Hamilton's business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are hard knocks for a business which, according to Hamilton, has less than R1-million - cash raised from the recent private sale to private buyers of about one million Hamilton Airship shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What these shares will buy is difficult to assess. According to Hamilton, the shares' value will jump to R18 from R1,50 in just six months, if all goes according to plan. In the process, this would make Hamilton, the majority shareholder, a rich man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But analysts look askance at the slick Hamilton prospectus. The company's books indicate it is insolvent, they say. It has never turned a profit, nor had any income. All but R28 000 of its &quot;fixed assets&quot; is R1,7-million spent on research and development - hardly a tangible asset, and an accounting technique which raised stockbrokers' eyebrows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamilton remains unfazed. Assuming the cash is raised, within weeks, he says, construction begins on phase one of an 8ha, 25- storey hangar big enough to handle the 129m Nelson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Denel Aviation will work on refining the airship design - provided Hamilton raises the financing. Denel is waiting to hear from Hamilton's company. &quot;They haven't given us an indication yet to show they have the necessary guarantees,&quot; says Connie Vester, Denel Aviation's CEO.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The commissioner spreads the photos on the table. A slope of tamboekie grass, a wind- blue sky, some fresh soil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He shows us the place ... we dig ... we find red topsoil mixed with black subsoil ... we know ... and then the spade hits something ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She was brave this one, hell she was brave,&quot; says the grave indicator, the perpetrator, and whistles softly through his teeth.  &quot;She simply would not talk.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The skull has a bullet hole right on the top. &quot;She must have been kneeling ...&quot; says the commissioner.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ribs. Breastbone that once held heart. Around the pelvis is a blue plastic bag. &quot;Oh yes,&quot; remembers the grave indicator. &quot;We kept her naked, and after 10 days she had made herself this panty.&quot; He sniggers: &quot;God ... she was brave.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commissioner's eyes are burnished in the brilliant yellow of anger. It is he who said: &quot;Sometimes at night I wake up with a rage pounding in my breast ... as if to wipe me out like a veld fire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was he who tried during the last half-hour of FW de Klerk's political submission to pin down a connection between National Party policy and the deaths in KwaZulu- Natal. But like the commission's lawyer, like the other commissioners, he failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Klerk and his hostile delegation leaves. The room and passages are filled with rage. People swamped with fury and desperation. Desmond Tutu's skin hangs dull and loose from his face, his shoulders covered in defeat. I want to go to him in one or other infantile gesture. To kiss his ring, to touch his dress.  When De Klerk walked out, it was as if something forever slipped through my fingers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speechless, I stand before Tutu. From whence will words now come? For us. Us hanging, quivering, ill, from this soundless space of the Afrikaner past? What does one say? What the hell does one do with this load of skeletons, shame and ash?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was the day - the day the &quot;Big Dip&quot; began. The Day of the Undeniable Divide. One moment the people of this country were the closest they have ever been, the next they were further apart than they have ever been.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NP started mobilising on anti-truth commission sentiments.  Those in and around the commission began to feel the futility of the dream of reconciliation. What we have hoped for will never be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One cannot leave now,&quot; says a colleague. &quot;One must see the process through, otherwise one will be dangling in the air forever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We ask the commission about plans for the end of the year. Any ceremony to conclude its workings and set people free of the past?  The commission is vague. It is obviously more concerned with the final report and two vaults of amnesty applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why do people hang in there? Has the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) become the last empire of naive righteousness and impossible dreams?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But those in and around the commission have been singed into their own versions of Vlakplaas units. We from the press can only talk to each other. We buy food for each other, we live each other's stories - we experience the process through a thousand eyes. Every second person in the street looks like a commissioner, every group looks like the investigative unit on its way to a breakthrough. We and the guards are on first-name terms. We all want to resign. We all yearn for another beat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Tzaneen, a young Tswana interpreter is interviewed. The man holds on to the table-top, his other hand moves restlessly in his lap. &quot;It is difficult to interpret victim hearings,&quot; he says, &quot;because you use the first person all the time. 'I sit in front of the mortuary ... on a low wall ... I have to identify my child ...  while I wait I see liquid ... slowly coming from under the door down to a drain at the corner of the building ... I see it is red ... I see it is also green ... I just walk ... I think they didn't find me for a long time ... I have no distance when I say I it runs through me with I.' ... After the first three months of hearings, my wife and our baby left me because of my violent outbursts. The truth commission provided counselling and I was advised to stop. But I don't want to. This is my history, and I want to be part of it - until the end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The end. We all wait for the end. And we assume the truth commission will provide this end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is a disastrous attitude,&quot; says Valkenberg psychiatrist Dr Sean Kaliski. &quot;People thought that the truth commission would be this quick fix, this rugby World Cup scenario and that we would go through the process and fling our arms around each other, and we'll be blood brothers for ever more. And that is absolute nonsense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The TRC is where the reality of this country is hitting home and hitting home very hard. And that is good. But there will be no grand release - every individual will have to devise his or her own personal method of coming to terms with what has happened.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anti-truth commission attitudes blast into the open. The commission is bombarded with demands and legal threats, Parliament besieged with truth commission debates, TRC reporters targeted with hate mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A column-writer in the Free State writes: &quot;Reject the truth commission with the disgust it deserves - on untested evidence it tries to portray the Afrikaner as the icon of all evil. Untested evidence has become the truth of the 'boerehaters'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaliski says it is a positive development if people feel compelled to deny these things. It is the first step in a process akin to the stages terminally ill patients experience: denial, rage, bargaining, depression - out of which acceptance will eventually surface.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think people are too impatient,&quot; says Kaliski. &quot;I personally would be very concerned if whites could overnight integrate information that overturns their whole world view. It will take decades, generations, and people will assimilate the truths of this country piece by piece.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaliski says that white Afrikaners in particular are feeling terribly exposed. &quot;If you personalise it: a very proud person who is publicly exposed for being a scoundrel will almost never respond with humility and contrition; they will almost always respond with anger and outrage. The community feels exposed because they have been caught out, shown up as evil, and this is very hard to deal with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vocabulary around the truth commission changes from phase to phase, but the word that pitched most constantly was: underestimate. Everything of, in and around the dynamics of the truth commission has been underestimated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only nightmare is the possibility that the commission missteps so wrongly that it wipes out all its successes. Of late, overestimate has become a much-used word. And this shortly before the commission has to pass its last two milestones. Two impossible ones: reconciliation and reparation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the two go hand in hand. The one cannot be without the other. If people don't get reparation, they won't forgive. If people are not forgiven, they won't offer reparation. Or rather, this was my thinking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Klerk was nothing more or less than a politician looking for a forum to sort out tensions in his own ranks. &quot;Don't worry,&quot; says someone, &quot;the commission has enough evidence on De Klerk. He will eat his words.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if he eats them, and has his nose rubbed in it, what will happen then? I wonder. Will he then be forgiven? Will people assist with reparation because they feel deeply humiliated? Will white and black in small rural towns now work jointly for the benefit of those who suffered the most?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I ask a Jewish colleague: &quot;What kind of reparation was made by the Germans?&quot; He spells out an impressive scenario, ranging from free transport and pensions, to leaders kneeling at Jewish memorials. And money - money from the Federal Republic of Germany was the largest contributing factor to the full industrialisation of Israel ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think about the unimaginative reparation document workshopped some months ago. I also know better than to ask him whether anyone was forgiven on the basis of reparation. Is contrition in the form of reparation then just as futile as denial?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And suddenly it is as if an undertow is taking me out ... out and out. And behind me sinks the country of my skull like a sheet in the dark - and I hear a thin song, hoofs, hedges of venom, fever and destruction fermenting and hissing underwater. I shrink and prickle. Against. Against my blood and the heritage thereof. Will I forever be them - recognising them as I do daily in my nostrils? Yes. And what we have done will never be undone.  It doesn't matter what we do. What De Klerk does. Unto the third and the fourth generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Famished. Parched, one waits on Constand Viljoen. A modest group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viljoen speaks as if he wants to capture something, bring back something, confirm some essence of Afrikanerskap that is wholesome. One wants it. But at the same time knows it not to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Viljoen talks about how the British have taken away the land of the Boers, an English journalist mutters: &quot;Ah shame!&quot; Before I realise, I spit like a flame: &quot;Shut up, you - Viljoen is at least trying.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viljoen was the only political leader who requested that a special reconciliation commission be set up next year: &quot;The hardening of attitudes I experience daily.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the first political submissions last year I interviewed Tutu. &quot;Weren't you irritated that you had to listen to four versions of South Africa's past?&quot; He spreads his four skinny fingers under my nose. &quot;Four versions ... four ... exist of the life of Christ. Which one would you have liked to chuck out?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I try another question. &quot;Why did the last part of the ANC submission sound so paranoid? As if the whole world is in a conspiracy against Thabo Mbeki.&quot; Tutu replies that many people are the second or third generation to be persecuted. &quot;And if you don't know the past, you will never understand today's politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A friend who has emigrated is visiting me in the office. She answers a call. &quot;It's your child. He says he's writing a song on Joe Mamasela and he needs a buzzword to rhyme with Vlakplaas.&quot; She lowers the phone. &quot;Who is Joe Mamasela?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A massive sigh breaks through my chest. For the first time in months - I breathe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The absolution one has given up on, the hope for a catharsis, the ideal of reconciliation, the dream of a powerful reparation policy ... Maybe this is all that is important - that I and my child know Vlakplaas and Mamasela. That we know what happened there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the truth commission process started last year, one instinctively realised: if you cut yourself off from the process, you will wake up in a foreign country - a country that you don't know and that you will never understand.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutjiku - The Kxoe, an 8 000-strong section of Southern Africa's Bushman community, are being squeezed out of their lands in Namibia's Caprivi Strip by the regal aspirations of a neighbouring tribal leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erwin Mbambo, chief of the Mbukushu people, has given land belonging to the Kxoe to the Namibian government so it can expand on a prison-rehabilitation complex. The move, which enjoys government backing, will destroy a tourist camp built to benefit the Kxoe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbambo is sending his people to Kxoe land in an effort to force the government to de- proclaim the game park that runs along much of the Caprivi Strip, and therefore spread his power. &quot;I have been encouraging my people across the river so that they can look for their survival,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young chief of the Kxoe, Kipi George, is finding himself ever more powerless in the face of Mbambo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our forefathers were enslaved by the Mbukushu, and Mbambo still wants it that way,&quot; said Thaddeus Chedau, senior counsellor to George. &quot;We think that maybe we should do something as the government doesn't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbambo, who claims that the colonial powers downgraded his office from king to mere tribal chief, refuses to tolerate the Kxoe's claims to land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He took a swipe at a group of German linguists studying the Kxoe language in the area by accusing them of trying to annex his land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbambo fought with Swapo during Namibia's liberation struggle.  The Kxoe, meanwhile, spent much of the war acting as trackers for South Africa's infantry units. The war turned much of the Caprivi Strip into a vast military camp for anti-Swapo forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a press conference last week to promote the expansion of the centre, Minister of Prisons Marco Hausikucalled George a &quot;headman&quot; and confirmed the government's intention to promote Mbambo as the area's chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This contradicts the government's Traditional Authorities Act which says: &quot;Every traditional community may be entitled to have a traditional authority comprising of (among other things) one chief.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior civil servant in the ministry who fought with Mbambo went to great efforts to impress the point on journalists that George had murdered many Swapo fighters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chedau laughed at the claim. &quot;He was never in the army,&quot; he said. &quot;We elected him from school in 1987.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kxoe community first heard of the expansion when two prison officers went to the camp three weeks ago and told the two women running it that they were on land given to the Ministry of Prisons by Mbambo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George and three of his advisers drove to Windhoek to see government officials in other ministries. &quot;The ministers said they would do something but nothing happened,&quot; said Chedau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reality was that the people the Kxoe delegation had seen convened a meeting with Hausiku.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The meeting resolved that if there is an honest plan to create a financially viable community project, an alternative plot will be allocated,&quot; said Hausiku, confirming that the decision had been made: the camp was to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government owns the communal land in the north of Namibia and therefore calls the shots, but Mbambo refuses to admit this to his people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the inauguration of the centre last year, the self-styled king made a great show of offering a large chunk of land, of which the Kxoe campsite is a part, to President Sam Nujoma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result there is little doubt that Mbambo not only has friends in the government, but has extended his power at the expense of the Kxoe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Kxoe have been here forever and if this is not their land then there is no land for the Kxoe,&quot; said Dr Matthias Brenzinger, one of the German linguists.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - Defiant Zanu-PF MPs are refusing to toe the party line, putting the president's position in jeopardy, reports Francis Murape from Harare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu-PF party faces a growing anti-corruption rebellion from within its parliamentary ranks in the biggest challenge in President Robert Mugabe's 17 years of uninterrupted rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Parliament, dominated 147 to 3 by Zanu- PF and hitherto regarded as a rubber-stamp of executive decisions emanating from Mugabe's office, is alive with discontent over the party's nonchalant attitude towards corruption in high places.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the centre is popular independent MP Margeret Dongo who was expelled from the party for standing against Mugabe's unpopular candidate in the 1995 parliamentary elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zanu-PF hardliners watched in dismay as more than 100 MPs supported Dongo's motion calling on the auditor general to probe the Z$450-million War Victims Compensation Fund looted by senior party officials in the biggest scandal to hit Zimbabwe since independence in 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior party officials had earlier tried to thwart the motion, fearing a full disclosure of how party leaders stole funds meant to compensate victims of the war of liberation could do irreparable damage to the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The civil servant who blew the whistle on the scam died a few weeks after the disclosure in what was officially reported as suicide, but what relatives say was murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the Dongo-led rebellion won in Parliament on May 28, the defiant Zanu-PF MPs struck again the next day, humiliating Vice- President Simon Muzenda in his bid to force them to endorse a total of Z$975-million in loans secured abroad for the construction of a terminal at Harare airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are accountable to each other as Zimbabweans and also to our constituents. We do not want to be in the history books as having taken decisions that destroyed our country,&quot; said one MP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tender for the design of the airport was won by a controversial businessman, Leo Mugabe, nephew of the president, after the project was re-tendered to accommodate him and his Cypriot partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MPs say bidders with funds available to finance the project were made to lose to accommodate Mugabe family interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leo Mugabe has in the past won tenders for Harare's sewage treatment works, government- building projects and the first privately run mobile cellular telephone system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MPs, who suspected that Leo Mugabe could be a front for his uncle, have an unlikely ally in retired general Tapfumaneyi Mujuru, whose phenomenal wealth, acquired in less than 15 years, has baffled observers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insiders say that by supporting the MPs' refusal to endorse the airport project loans, Mujuru is trying to have a go at the president, who has blocked his bid to acquire a third of the chrome-mining giant Zimasco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe has threatened to nationalise Zimasco should Mujuru's bid go ahead, alleging the US-based owners of the company acquired it fraudulently when the government still had shares in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, insiders say the MPs suspect Mugabe wants it to parcel out shares to his favourites under the guise of black economic empowerment or indigenisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has promised to re-table the controversial loans for endorsement, but the Zanu-PF MPs are unlikely to budge in what could bring about a crisis of confidence in Mugabe's government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 100 MPs have it within their power to force new presidential and parliamentary elections as only a two-thirds majority is required to throw out the government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A murder docket has been opened by the police after a Burundian refugee died on the floor of a Home Affairs Department office in Cape Town half-an-hour after two policemen dumped him there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to witnesses, Jean-Pierre Kanyangwa was brought in early Monday afternoon, June 2, by policemen who had picked him up outside Cape Town station at 11am. He had arrived in South Africa from Burundi the day before, say fellow Burundian refugees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department says the death is to be investigated, but a departmental director, Jurie de Wet, said he was satisfied officials had handled the matter professionally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another Burundian, Jose Msabah, told the Friends of Refugees organisation he was in the offices at about 2.30pm and saw a man on the floor. &quot;I asked the man what was wrong. He requested to be taken to a hospital. He told me the police had beaten him. He appeared to be in a bad state and his pants were soaked with urine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One immigration official passed by this man and swore at him.  I then asked another official to call an ambulance as the man was dying. After some persuasion, an ambulance was called. By the time the ambulance arrived, the man's body was already cold ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundian refugees confirmed Kanyangwa was picked up by the police last Monday and at the time appeared in good health. &quot;They threw him into the van like an animal,&quot; they said. The refugees are unhappy about the incident and have written to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to complain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Minister of Home Affairs Lindiwe Sisulu heard a different version. According to her information, Kanyangwa was in pain when he arrived and an immigration officer immediately called for an ambulance. The official went with Kanyangwa, but he died en route to the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Deon Knobel, head of the department of forensic medicine at the University of Cape Town, has conducted a post- mortem. He said there had been no external evidence of Kanyangwa having been beaten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said that Kanyangwa had haemorrhaged and there was a large amount of bleeding in the abdomen, which resulted from a lacerated spleen, possibly brought on by trauma. He will perform extensive microscopic examinations of internal organs to exclude or confirm the presence of an underlying disease process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police say the criminal investigation department will be addressing the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Burundian refugees in Cape Town have not been told directly about the investigation and are despairing about their future in South Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It was from within the ANC itself that the opposition to child grant cuts came, forcing the minister of welfare to reassess her proposed scheme, writes Marion Edmunds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Practical problems and criticism from within the African National Congress have driven Minister of Welfare Geraldine Fraser- Moleketi to back away from key parts of her controversial child grants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fraser-Moleketi told the Mail &amp; Guardian that the scheme would only be implemented next year - not from August 1 as planned. The method of phasing out the current grants - received mostly by whites, coloureds and Indians - could be changed, she added.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Originally the grants were to be phased out over five years, dropping 20% a year, to cushion families entirely dependent on state money. Fraser-Moleketi asked not to be questioned on this aspect of the plan, because of her uncertainty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the ANC's caucus meeting last week she was taken to task by senior members. It is believed a number of ANC MPs oppose phasing out the grants over five years as it would lead to a disparity in pay-outs which would continue to exist during the 1999 election campaign and could be used against the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have also been complaints about the proposals from concerned non-governmental organisations (NGOs), which have been fighting the reduction of state grants on grounds that too little money would be provided to too few mothers and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NGOs have presented Parliament with information about the destitution which coloured and Indian recipients would suffer if their current grants were removed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Deputy President Thabo Mbeki joined the debate by saying in Parliament this week: &quot;At the heart of this matter is the unswerving determination of the government to end the system of racial discrimination in the system of welfare benefits, which in this specific instance resulted in the exclusion of the African mother and child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is therefore inevitable that an adjustment be made, so as to bring into the net the greatest possible number of people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fraser-Moleketi is having to go back to the drawing-board to grapple with how to introduce equity in state grants, remain within budgetary limits and please all constituencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her department is also ill-equipped to implement such a scheme.  It has not yet developed a means test through which it can target the recipients of the intended new scheme - the 30% poorest children in the land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research must still be done to identify them, and pilot projects have yet to be set up. The department is establishing a task- team to help find solutions and ways of implementing them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, after a series of public hearings, the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Welfare rejected Fraser-Moleketi's proposed grant of R75 a month to the poorest children up to six years. It is expected the committee will propose that the state pay R135 per child up to the age of 12 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fraser-Moleketi is defensive about her shifts in position: &quot;August 1 is not the date for actual implementation, it is the time by which we are going to have a plan on the table ... so we are actually talking about implementation in the beginning of 1998, with possibly some take up by the end of 1997.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Zambian President Frederick Chiluba has more than doubled the salaries of his Supreme Court judges, prompting accusations that he is attempting to influence the outcome of the legal challenge to his re-election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increases - the second in nine months - push the salary for Zambia's chief justice from R416 000 to just under R1-million a year, while his deputy's salary doubles, to R720 000. Other Supreme Court judges see their salaries more than double, to R640 000. Car allowances and loan facilities have also ballooned.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba is facing a supreme court challenge to his re-election last November, with several opposition parties claiming his father was not Zambian. Foreigners are not eligible to be president.  Witnesses presented to the court by the opposition parties have claimed Chiluba's father was from what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, or from Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberal Progressive Front, one of the parties, claims Chiluba's salary hikes are an attempt to influence the outcome of the challenge. &quot;The increases have been made to coincide with the hearing of the presidential petition,&quot; says representative Rodger Chongwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The package has been prepared by the respondent. It's vulgar and is being made in bad faith. Increases of more than 100% are unrealistic, especially when people are starving and are dying of hunger and diseases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United National Independence Party chair Malimba Masheke says the increases have compromised the judiciary's impartiality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other opposition parties say the increases, granted through an executive statutory instrument, are unconstitutional: Zambia's Constitution stipulates that judges must have their salaries approved by Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A statutory instrument is not an Act of Parliament,&quot; says Patrick Mavunga, one of the lawyers in the parties' court fight.  &quot;This is therefore illegal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Judicial Service Commission plays down the increases.  Its secretary, Timothy Katanekwa, says the commission secured the new conditions of service for judges after negotiations with the Cabinet Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says Chiluba has not arbitrarily determined the hikes, but was empowered under the Judges' Conditions of Service Act of 1996 to prescribe new conditions for the judges. The Act does not require salaries of constitutional office holders to be sanctioned by Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Katanekwa adds that the size of the salaries does not justify the uproar from opposition parties: &quot;The salary of the chief justice is nothing considering the amount of work involved.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazzaville - Armed gangs of 'Zulus' and 'Khoikhois' roam the streets fighting for the control of Brazzaville, reports Dalal Magan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gangs of armed youths roam the rutted streets. Some as young as 12, who can barely handle their automatic rifles, engage in sporadic fighting for the control of Brazzaville. As the battle rages, travellers who have managed to escape the mayhem speak of alleys strewn with decomposing bodies, many of them innocents, women and children caught in the crossfire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The armed youths are the dispossessed urchins of Congo, who for personal and political survival have become pawns in the power game of the adults. They belong to the Ninjas, the Cobras, the Zulus, the Khoikhois, or some other yet to be named faction or militia group.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazzaville is the new Mogadishu. It already has its own south and north divide, a green line, and a perilious Bermuda triangle - a no man's land roamed by different gangs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congo is no stranger to violent take-overs and bloody power struggles. Since its ascent to nationhood 37 years ago, it has had a dozen coup d'etats, aborted coups and a miniature civil war, eight presidents - four of whom were overthrown, one assassinated and another executed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1992, Pascal Lissouba was elected president in the country's first democratic elections, ending Denis Sassou Nguessou's 13-year military rule. Lissouba's victory promised a fresh political start and a bright economic future. But that was not to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new political parties did not have any major ideological differences. Instead they appealed to ethnic and regional sentiments, and manipulated public opinion by turning one group against the other in competition for power. Parochial interests prevailed and ethnic chauvinism triumphed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1993, supporters of President Lissouba's Pan-African Union for Social Democracy, and Bernard Kolela, leader of the opposition Congolese Movement for Democracy and Development, engaged in fierce clashes in the capital city. After much bloodletting and massive destruction of infrastructure, and a protracted mediation, the two finally reconciled. Kolela, considered the Etienne Tshisikedi of Congo-Brazzaville, is now the mayor of the divided city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite Lissouba's economic reforms, the majority of the people are still waiting to reap the dividends. And his massive privatisation programme has forced thousands of job losses. His policies have generated fierce resentment and resistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nguessou and his Congolese Workers' Party appear to be the main beneficiaries of this growing opposition to the government.  Tension began to rise in the run-up to the July presidential and parliamentary elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a bid to finish his arch-rival Nguessou, Lissouba opted for a military solution. Ten days ago, he sent the Congolese army to arrest the former ruler and disable his heavily armed Cobra militias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lissouba's miscalculated move back-fired. Out-gunned by the Cobras his army and militia fled in disarray. Nguessou was backed by the new president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Laurent Kabila, and by President Eduardo dos Santos of Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lissouba's ill-fated decision is a massive blow to Jonas Savimbi's Unita movement and the Cabinda separatists whose strongest backing, since the fall of Mobutu, came from Brazzaville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The action triggered a violent backlash that poses grave consequences not only for Lissouba but also for the fragile Congolese state. Within hours, Brazzaville had turned into a dangerous and chaotic place of gang warfare, fiefdoms and marauding freelance gunmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Law and order has broken down completely, the rump of what used to be the national army fractured into ethnic-based factions loyal to regional warlords. Congo has taken the road to anarchy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only hope of breaking the lethal logjam building up in Brazzaville appears to lie outside; but after the Somalia fiasco foreign intervention, even by the French, has become a dirty word.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is more likely is that Congo will take its place among the growing club of failed states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The UN's secretary general, Kofi Annan, this week expressed the fear that the instability and violence in some African countries, unless checked, could easily have a domino effect throughout the continent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Roelf Meyer is to test support for his new movement in the Western Cape next week, hoping to win over the hotly contested coloured community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meyer's Athlone-based organiser, former Labour Party member Ken Lategan, said this week: &quot;There has been unprecedented interest in the last two weeks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">People are looking for something new, people are speaking among themselves and the word is spreading, we are getting calls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lategan could not pinpoint any particular income group or geographical area which supported Meyer, but said a common theme was people's dissatisfaction with the status quo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are saying that nobody is representing their interests and they want a party which expresses the way they feel and their needs. That is not coming from either the African National Congress or the National Party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lategan said invitations would be sent to &quot;opinion-makers&quot; to meet Meyer when he came to Cape Town next week. NP members had come to his house to ask for details of the programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meyer's plans to win support in Cape townships come in the same week that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission heard allegations that he had been present at a State Security Council meeting which approved support for Witdoek vigilantes which destroyed Cape townships in 1986.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile the NP is holding a &quot;solidarity rally&quot; on Saturday to show support for party leader FW de Klerk. A series of profile- building walkabouts for De Klerk is planned, anticipating a rekindling of grassroots support for the beleaguered leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NP provincial MEC Gerald Morkel dismissed Meyer's chances of success as minimal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Gang warfare in KwaMashu township has grown out of old anti-apartheid alliances, writes Enoch Mthembu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least eight people were killed in Durban's KwaMashu township this week after a feud between rival African National Congress factions broke out into open warfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Umkhonto weSizwe (MK) exiles and members of the township's self-defence unit began fighting each other in KwaMashu's L section last Friday, and spent much of Sunday in running gun-battles. Four of the deaths occurred the next day.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One woman told how her son was cornered and shot in front of her, after days of being hunted down. His killers then turned their AK-47s on animals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killings are a chilling counterpoint to high-level talks currently underway between the ANC and the Inkatha Freedom Party to seek peace in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses say about 12 people died although the police say only eight deaths have been confirmed so far. At least 13 people were wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides are now calling for troops to be deployed to end the fighting, claiming the local police are powerless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police arrived in the township last Friday night, collected AK- 47 cartridges but made no arrests. The fighting continued after they left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not want the police, we want the soldiers to come and stop this war,&quot; one gang leader said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC's provincial security spokesman, Bheki Cele, says party officials tried to broker peace talks on Monday. But police say there were still reports of gunshots in the area on Wednesday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poverty-stricken township to the north of Durban has long suffered from clashes between ANC and IFP groups, fomented by local criminals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the latest violence stems directly from rivalry between former exiles and MK soldiers - in a gang called Serajee - and self-defence unit members, who stayed through the struggle, in a gang called the Phofu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former mounted an anti-crime campaign in the township, which the latter gang took as a threat to their influence. The Serajee, meanwhile, accuse the Phofu of being responsible for much of the crime in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Exiles want to dictate to us how we must live our lives,&quot; says Phofu member Andile Ngcobo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not employed, therefore we must gista (steal cars) to get money. We live in the poorest section. We want money to extend our houses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngcobo says that the ANC national chairman, Jacob Zuma, &quot;has tried to stop the war, but peace only prevails for a few months.  &quot;The anti-crime campaign started all these problems. The police from the local police station won't stop the war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parents of Mduduzi Radebe recounted how their son spent his final days dodging members of the Serajee gang. They caught up with him on Monday, and shot him repeatedly, ignoring his mother's terrified pleas to leave him alone. They then turned their AK- 47s on livestock owned by his family and neighbours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about Radebe's death, Serajee gang leaders laughed. They said their members had sacrificed their lives in exile, while those who stayed behind such as the Phofu gang had turned to crime: &quot;While we were busy fighting for freedom, they were busy smoking dagga. Where do they get the money to drive Porsches?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A shebeen owner, who did not want to be identified, said gunmen stole liquor from him during the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thokozisi Madonsela (19), who was shot in the leg in the Friday battle, cannot say what prompted the fighting. But he is convinced &quot;the war is not going to stop&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cele says the police must take much of the blame. He claims gang members routinely walk around the township heavily armed, unencumbered by any police interference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The crux of the matter is that there are people who are gaining out of this violence. Why aren't the police making arrests?&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Africa Hinterland, Um-khonto weSizwe's arms- smuggling tourist company front, was never detected by the apartheid government's security forces. But through a tragic coincidence, London's Scotland Yard nearly stumbled on to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heather Newham owned a small bistro near Greenwich, and was active in London's political left. In 1987 a friend who happened to be a member of the &quot;London Traders&quot;, which controlled Africa Hinterland for MK, asked if she would help out in the office.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She agreed. Along with two directors, Newham now made up the public face of the tour company. Working from its Greenwich offices, she had to market safaris on the overland truck, answer calls and respond to mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although she, like the directors, did not have details, she knew there was more to it. &quot;For a long time I thought it was just personnel. I thought we were kept in the dark deliberately. (But) we were not naive,&quot; she said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By August 1991 the company had moved to Johannesburg and the Greenwich office was closing down. Newham was out of the loop. But on the second-last day of that month Scott Singleton, a delusional aviation freak posing as an executive from Africa Hinterland, phoned 17-year-old Lynne Rogers, offering her a job interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, Singleton had run a small business from the same complex as the ANC front company, which is how he intercepted her job application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an apparent sex attack gone wrong, Singleton strangled Rogers when they met - a murder as sensational as it was tragic.  Before Scotland Yard's detectives identified Singleton, the trail led to Africa Hinterland, where Newham had a lot of explaining to do. &quot;When the police did come, I was very nervous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others say Newham used all her charm, winning the detectives over and preventing a full probe of Africa Hinterland. Mannie Brown, convenor of the London Traders, said: &quot;If they'd investigated the books of the company, they would have seen some very strange injections of cash.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For years afterwards one of the Scotland Yard men visited Newham's bistro, which she still runs, and sent her Christmas cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newham only learnt the full truth about Africa Hinterland's activities about two years ago. She was surprised, &quot;but I didn't feel I would have changed anything had I known&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Singleton is serving a life sentence for the murder.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Stefaans BrUmmer investigates one of the most successful and audacious projects in Umkhonto weSizwe's armed fight against apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Underseat storage for food supplies, camping equipment, tools, spares, etc,&quot; was how a brochure touted the ample luggage capacity of the safari truck. What the brochure did not mention were the extra compartments - so secret they were not discovered in seven years of border-hopping - which had a capacity to hide three- quarters of a ton of AK47s, explosives, detonators and the like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, for the first time, members of the underground struggle have told how they pulled off one of the most successful and audacious projects in the armed fight against apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using a converted Bedford truck - with unsuspecting young Aussie and Kiwi travellers installed on the upholstered seats at the back - a small group of Umkhonto weSizwe (MK) operatives and supporters smuggled up to 30 tons of war materiel from the frontline states into South Africa between 1987 and the early 1990s.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project was run behind the facade of the tour company Africa Hinterland - an MK front funded &quot;in brown paper envelopes&quot; by the African National Congress - registered first in Britain and later also in South Africa. It accounted for the majority of MK arms brought into the country at the time: as much as 90% in the later years, according to some estimates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Launched when &quot;overland trucking&quot; became popular among young tourists, Africa Hinterland still stood out: while overland tours generally went no further south than Harare or Gaborone, the ANC operation &quot;broke&quot; the cultural boycott, taking its passengers all the way to Johannesburg and Cape Town. Repercussions from the Anti- Apartheid Movement were feared, but never materialised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian became an unwitting, minor partner when it published regular ads for the Africa Hinterland tours throughout the early 1990s and as late as December 1993. The actual smuggling of weapons appears to have been halted not long after an end to armed hostilities was agreed in the Pretoria Minute of August 1990, but the safari operation itself was maintained for some time as a fall-back option in case negotiations broke down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behind Africa Hinterland was a small London- based underground committee, the &quot;London Traders&quot;. Convened by the &quot;red millionaire&quot;, veteran communist businessman Mannie Brown, its members included the likes of fellow communist Wolfie Kodesh (for a short while), MK operatives Muff Andersson and her then- husband Calvin Khan, and a leading British academic who prefers to remain anonymous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also on the committee at one stage, and the designer of the truck, was Rodney Wilkinson, revealed in the M&amp;G 18 months ago as the man who planted the limpet mines that severely damaged the Koeberg nuclear plant. The bombing, shortly before the plant was to have been commissioned in 1982, was one of the great coups of MK's special operations division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Brown and Kodesh were close friends of Joe Slovo, then MK chief-of-staff and head of special operations, under whose command Africa Hinterland was created. Aziz Pahad, then a leading light in the London underground and now deputy foreign minister, played a key role alongside Slovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cassius Make, MK's head of ordnance until he was assassinated by an apartheid death squad in Swaziland at the end of 1987, controlled the provision and distribution of the armaments. That role was taken over in 1988 by &quot;Rashid&quot;, by then Slovo's successor as head of special operations. He is now a senior member of the Defence Secretariat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa Hinterland has, since its disbandment, remained one of the ANC alliance's best-kept secrets, perhaps among other reasons because arms remain a sensitive subject in violence-ridden South Africa. But the main local players have applied for amnesty from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which means inevitable exposure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown said the project had brought greater security to MK arms- smuggling operations. Previously, weapons had been brought into South Africa in piecemeal fashion, often in hidden compartments of cars, but the dangers were many and the turnover low. &quot;This was successful, whereas the others were risky.&quot; That &quot;innocent tourists were used as cover&quot; still bothers him, &quot;but drivers were trained to avoid accidents&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The overland idea was first mooted in the late Sixties, when Slovo visited Brown in London. Brown had gone into exile in 1963 after possible exposure in a scheme to help political prisoners escape. Brown sent his sons on an overland trip, but they reported the chances of detection too great.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the 1980s it was different: better technologies had been developed to seal arms, preventing detection by sniffer dogs, and the frontline states had become favourably disposed towards the armed struggle. An endless supply of arms was available from the Eastern bloc countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wilkinson arrived in London in 1983, fresh from his bombing escapade at Koeberg. In liaison with Pahad, he started working on plans for the overland truck. Slovo brought Wilkinson and Brown together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Brown: &quot;(Wilkinson) explained to me his design. Joe asked me, would it work; I said I didn't see how it couldn't work ... It was a brilliant design.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was simple: luggage and camping equipment were stored under the passenger seats, but with access only from outside the truck body. The cavities went another 10cm deeper along the entire 5m length of the passenger section, but blocked off from the outside and accessible only from under the passenger seats. Hidden rods undid the seat upholstery, revealing metal covers which were unbolted to access the smuggling compartments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan was on: the ANC London office paid the first funds to Brown on May 10 1985, and on June 30 1986 Africa Hinterland was registered as a British company. Wilkinson spent the better part of 1986 at a workshop he rented in Ipswich, converting a brand-new Bedford truck into an overlander. His budget: Pounds 80 000, including the price of the vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around Christmas 1986 the truck was shipped to Kenya's port of Mombasa. Two months later the first of the trips started along a 10 000km route from Nairobi through Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe or Botswana to South Africa - visiting, of course, all the tourist attractions along the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Except when a &quot;dry run&quot; was undertaken because of security scares, the passengers would be separated from the truck in Lusaka while it was being &quot;serviced&quot; by Khan. The guns and explosives, already sealed in grease, plastic and heavy tin-foil, and packed in boxes made to fit the oblong compartments, were stashed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once in South Africa, the consignment was received by supporters recruited and trained by the ordinance section's Andersson and Khan under Make, and later Rashid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The drivers would hire a van under false names, transfer the weapons to it, and leave it at predetermined parking lots - such as at Eastgate shopping centre in Johannesburg or the Pick 'n Pay headquarters building in Claremont, Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown said: &quot;The internal and external units never came into contact (to protect identities). The internals were told to look for certain signals on the vehicle.&quot; The &quot;internals&quot; would remove the van, empty it and return it to the same place for the drivers to collect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown said: &quot;Of course the real heroes of this story are the drivers. They have not been celebrated ... They were the ones who risked their liberty, while I was sitting comfortably in London.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Rashid took over, it was decided to run the tours from South Africa. Shorter two-week safaris (against the earlier two months) meant a faster turnaround. The shift took place about the same time the ANC was unbanned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task of keeping the tour company going and driving the truck now fell largely to a young Dutch citizen, the latest in a string of foreign drivers. He would drop the travellers in a game park, then load the consignment somewhere in Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The driver said from Amsterdam this week: &quot;Crossing the border, one always had the odd nervous moment. But we were running a safari ... The soldiers at the border would just see a bunch of nice tourists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The driver said the arms smuggling continued for a while after the Pretoria Minute was signed - probably until early 1991 - but MK remained involved in the company until about the end of 1992, &quot;just to make sure that if negotiations broke down we had the opportunity to take it up again&quot;. After that, until 1994, he continued running Africa Hinterland as a purely commercial operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Technically, MK's continued role in Africa Hinterland after August 1990 probably contravened the Pretoria Minute. But, said Jakkie Cillliers of the Institute for Security Studies: &quot;Everybody hedged their bets. The government was doing it; the ANC was doing it ... It was par for the course.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The fountain of youth that doesn't run dry with age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Africa, the definition of youth could fall anywhere between birth and mid- 30s. Maria McCloy considers how the lines have been blurred in today's society</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Youth, /ju:q/ n. (pl.youths/ju:qz/) 1. the state of being young; the period between childhood and adult age. 2. the vigour or enthusiasm, inexperience, or other characteristic of this period. 3. an early stage of development etc. 4. a young person (esp. male). 5. (pl.) young people collectively (the youth of the country). (Old English geoguth from Germanic: related to YOUNG.)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not only the Oxford English Dictionary that has multiple definitions of &quot;youth&quot;. How you define it depends on which South African sector you form part of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sandile Dikeni is station manager of Y-FM, a Johannesburg station that aims to capture the &quot;youth market&quot; when it is up and running.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says he's reluctant to put &quot;a fixed, fixed date for when you can be chucked out of that bracket called youth. Who makes the rules to now say 'you should be kicked out of youth'?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judging by the age limits set in the youth wings of South African political parties, the term &quot;youth&quot; can apply to people up to the age of 35. Deputy Environmental Affairs Minister Peter Mokaba was in his 30s when serving as president of the African National Congress Youth League - and the newly elected president of the National Party Youth League, Max van der Watt, is 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The youth league, just as the National Youth Commission Act of 1996 sets youth between the ages of 14 and 35.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A definition of the age when South Africans will finally be considered grown up is likely to be on the agenda of a meeting later this month organised by National Youth Commission chair Mahlengi Bhengu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations Children's Fund takes its definition of a child from the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child: from birth to 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the educational system has something to do with South Africans' broad definitions of youth. A flawed and disrupted education system has ensured a population of ageing scholars who get to the labour market late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most advertisers tend to follow All Media Product Survey research figures, which define anyone older than 16 as an adult.  But Jonathan Swanepoel of advertising agency Herdbuoys says he's seen figures on unemployment referring to youths as people of 34 and under.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He sees the youth market as between the ages of 16 and 24: a market which, he says, generally has school or university in common, gets pocket money and holds to similar value systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the 16-to-24 demarcation comes the 24-to-35 age bracket, a market seen to have different activities and aspirations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whom does television see as youth? Brenda Kali, head of youth programming at the SABC, says they cater for different age groups when it comes to children: ages three to seven, then seven to 13, and finally 13 to 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And youth? Sixteen to 24 is the target market of shows like Jam Alley, Inside Info and Electric Workshop. But, she adds, there is &quot;a crossover of interests, because they aspire to what older kids are doing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Y-FM's Dikeni says research done on the proposed target market for the youth- oriented station has marked their audience out as &quot;16 to 24 with spillovers&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But personally Dikeni sees youth as between the ages of 13 and 30. Why? Because he feels that because of the political situation, he and many others started early on making &quot;quite major decisions&quot; on becoming politically active.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;notion of childhood is a very dicey one&quot;, he says, and it varies from place to place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a child growing up during apartheid or the intifada, for example, will find his or her entry into youth and adulthood happens much earlier - and it would have been different from the passage from childhood to youth in a conventional Western society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But how different is it now? Maybe the lines are blurring again - for in today's society, children and/or youth are both at risk of catching Aids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abuse, violence, drug and alcohol abuse, single-parenthood and unemployment all affect young people as much as adults - and education has become as much an adult issue as one affecting only the youth.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Next time you're in Witbank, look carefully between the giant forms the electricity power-stations and the gangling steel factory. There, huddled in a space named Kwaguqa, you are likely meet an intrepid band of environmentalists who are trying to make a difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1994, a group of standard eight, nine and matric boys from Edward Matyeka School and their teacher, Haroon Maduna, started by clearing one</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Derided and ridiculed (&quot;Haven't you anything better to do?&quot;), the group persevered, dragging in the council to supply trees and grass plugs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students Themba Shongwe, Emmanuel Ramagayane and Colin Maseko laugh as they remember the stage at which people in the surrounding houses d soon word spread of their work. They have since organised regular that they had a green playground for their children where there had once been glass bottles and rubbish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They began to bring out food to us and the men came out and helped us,&quot; recalls Maduna.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heartened, the group moved on to other dumping sites in the township, volve testing water at various sites. The results from these tests will clean-up campaigns to involve the community, developed play areas and five other parks, as well as a perma- culture gardening project (using home-made compost, natural fertilisers and pesticides).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, they plan to begin a water- awareness project which will appears, are older people - the pensioners' gardening group removes the provide some evidence which can be used in the uphill task of awakening the factories bordering Kwaguqa to the fact that their atmospheric and water emissions are affecting the health and lives of the people who live near them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This project is good because it makes the youth responsible, and so, temptation to look to material or destructive things to occupy your time,&quot; says Ramagayane. &quot;However, the numbers of teenagers in the core group have dwindled since 1996.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Projects like these teach you self- reliance and about how environmental issues affect our lives,&quot; adds Shongwe, &quot;but some young people just don't appreciate that.&quot; Nevertheless, their effect has spread beyond their school. With the blessing of their school principal, the Edward Matyeka group has begun to work with satellite groups in the 10 primary schools in the area, engaging in gardening and recycling projects. Younger people, it seems, are more receptive to the idea of a healthy future.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Although the youths of today are receiving an education, they are now battling to find job opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 40% of young South Africans are neither employed nor in school, according to a study conducted by the National Youth Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This alarming figure, which applies to young people aged 14 to 35, can be blamed on a number of historical and cultural issues, says commission chair Mahlengeni Bhengu.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation is prevalent among the country's female population. &quot;Many young women in rural areas are inhibited by a lack of opportunities owing mainly to early motherhood and the status of young women in rural areas where traditional law still exists,&quot; says Bhengu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young people in such areas have found no opportunities in the job market - and no training system is in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkhabele Prusent, director of Employment Services in the Department of Labour, sees unemployment as a major problem. &quot;Young people are nowhere in South Africa today,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She believes the government has to look at improving the skills of school-leavers, thereby enabling them to have practical experience before they enter the workplace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need a skills revolution which looks at careers outside teaching or administration,&quot; says Prusent. &quot;We need youngsters with technical skills to be engineers or scientists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For this to happen, however, the attitude of teachers and other trainers needs to change. The government needs to become serious about implementing the many strategies and plans it envisages for young people - &quot;to have a stronger focus on the needs of the youth in South Africa, especially in terms of job opportunities&quot;, says Bhengu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission praises the government for the &quot;huge strides&quot; it has made in recognising the important role youth play in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission, established in 1996 to assist the government in developing a youth policy which would enhance job opportunities, skills training and education, will present its findings to the government at the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bhengu believes government's higher education policy is &quot;well co-ordinated&quot; and provides the majority of young people in South Africa with opportunities they never had in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African National Congress Youth League representative Thabo Masebe says the youth of today are fighting a different battle to those of 1976. &quot;That generation (1976) was fighting for equality and against Bantu Education,&quot; he says. &quot;Young people today have the opportunity in terms of education, but they are fighting for jobs and other means of improving their lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes the government has provided opportunities for the youth they have never had before, but in terms of employment opportunities the situation has not changed &quot;that much&quot;, compared to the period leading up to the elections in 1994. There is &quot;a lot of hope&quot; among young people today that the quality of life will improve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The youth league views its role as &quot;sensitising&quot; the government about problems facing the youth today. &quot;We will assist them with establishing initiatives and programmes aimed at accelerating youth development,&quot; says Masebe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The South African Association of Youth Clubs is changing direction again - this time it aims to motivate young people to take charge of their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'No, I definitely don't agree with the label 'the lost generation',&quot; says Mokoka Seshabela. &quot;Many young people are on the margins of society - they are unemployed, have no expertise, no long-term goals and so live for the now. It takes commitment to tackle the task, not defeatist labels.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seshabela should know. He's been involved with the Southern African Association of Youth Clubs for seven years, and is now its director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Formed in the 1930s, the association initially organised itself along racial lines and focused on leisure and recreational activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1985 its entire strategy changed when the sheer pressure of political and social upheaval caused the organisation to focus instead almost exclusively on courses and opportunities for leadership development and training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the exception of the Western Cape, there are clubs in every province, comprising anything from 15 to 50 members. These clubs are affiliated to the association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An annual fee of R50 entitles the 218 clubs that belong to the association to full use of the national infrastructure - library, training courses and membership camps - there's a regular bos- beraad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year's week-long membership camp includes inputs from mediation experts, the Independent Mediation Services of South Africa, the Gauteng Department of Health and media groups, discussing topics such as the Constitution, conflict- resolution and the importance of ambition in life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The association wants to move away from the idea that 'someone owes us' for fighting apartheid, or that we can blame the system for young people's position today. The youth have got to take charge of their lives,&quot; Seshabela says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet people don't take youth clubs seriously, he adds.  Nevertheless, with over 1 000 diverse clubs in Gauteng alone, the motto Youth Clubs - The Vehicle for Delivery would seem to justify itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some young people, clubs are even more important than school because they are structures the youth have created themselves, their passion and commitment remain rooted in the movement. They are prepared to invest in their clubs where they might not in school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seshabela aims to harness this enthusiasm and make youth clubs the vehicle through which personal and collective goals can be attained. &quot;We must affirm young people and move away from politics to development. That is the way forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there's no quick fix. Industry tried to throw obsolete computers at the problem of unoccupied ex-self-defence unit members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What does that say to our young people?&quot; he asks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seshabela is equally disparaging about youth activities that do not, in some way, develop their participants. Street parties and other purely recreational activities hold no attraction for this veteran of the youth club movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His own career path was strongly influenced by a dedicated youth worker in Soweto. And in some measure he seems to want to repay the debt he feels he owes the club movement. Part of the responsibility to the movement is keeping it relevant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up until the year 2000, the association has set itself the task of addressing a further constituency: to empower those who work with or train young people, because - at present - they are not well enough equipped to do the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, without real long-term investment from the government and industry, the needs and aspirations of these youth will not be met.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A billion-rand Wild Coast tourism development project must benefit the local communities while being eco- friendly, reports Craig Bishop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just 30km of coastline separate Port Edward from Mkambati, but as holiday destinations they are oceans apart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Port Edward is linked to Durban by 200km of flat coastal road allowing easy access for hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers bound for South Coast resorts every summer. Mkambati Nature Reserve lies on one of the world's most dramatic stretches of coastline, but is visited by a just a sprinkling of motorists willing to brave the appalling road from Flagstaff (over 100km inland) and the difficulty of getting a permit from Umtata bureaucrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, tourism has never brought significant benefits to communities living on the Wild Coast. Worse, in the policy vacuum created by the dismantling of the former Transkei, these communities looked on helplessly as chiefs and headmen sold off chunks of priceless communal coastline to commercial developers for as little as R50 (a &quot;registration fee&quot;), a bottle of brandy and a few sheep.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a watershed case last June, the Wildlife Society won a supreme court action over 300 illegal holiday cottages and shacks on the Transkei coast. Justice DJ Pickering ruled that the chiefs had no authority to allocate sites and that this had caused &quot;considerable and irreversible damage&quot; to the Transkei coastline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, some poor communities are fighting for increased access to coastal resources denied them by the creation of nature reserves in the Bantustan era. In the recent past, communities at Cwebe and Dwesa stripped shellfish from 14km of protected coastline in protest against their lack of access to ancestral graves, trees, shellfish, ritual sea water, sand and sea-grass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enter the R3-billion Wild Coast Spatial Development Initiative (SDI) - launched last November by the Eastern Cape Department of Economic and Environmental Affairs - which could be the second most significant of its kind after the Maputo Corridor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government is inviting the private sector to put forward proposals for the construction of key projects, which will anchor eco-tourism development on four main nodes of the inaccessible coastline between Port Edward and East London: the Dwesa/Cwebe nature reserves, Coffee Bay/Hole in the Wall, Port St Johns and Mkambati.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Estimated SDI expenditure includes R1,8-billion for construction of the toll road from Port Edward to Port St Johns, R500-million to develop 1 222-bed accommodation in the Dwesa/Cwebe reserves and R400-million for electrification and communications.  It is hoped a road will be built from the inland town of Idutywa to the coast at Nqabara-Dwesa and that a bridge and road will link Dwesa and Cwebe nature reserves. In addition, R60-million has been set aside for the construction of infrastructure to support private-sector developments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, says Eastern Cape nature conservation scientist Jim Feely, the SDI should not be allowed to &quot;ride roughshod over locals&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before development can take place, we need to ask who owns Wild Coast land.&quot; According to Feely, the SDI is currently focused on areas where land claims are in dispute -10% of the coastline.  &quot;We need to find out the value of the land, the economic potential, the terrestrial resources and the marine life to prevent communities from selling their land to developers and then being alienated from their traditional homes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wild Coast SDI project manager Vuyo Mahlati agrees, adding that before the SDI can fast-track development in the region and create an investor-friendly environment, serious issues need to be addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need clear legislation to give guidance to relations between private sector investors and Wild Coast communities.  Communities need to be well informed and need guidance so that they are on an equal footing with private investors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research is being carried out by various universities and the Oceanographic Research Institute in the fields of botany, zoology, marine biology, sociology and social anthropology, and this will form a comprehensive database, accessible to SDI project facilitators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, more than 70 representatives from government environmental agencies, community organisations, universities and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) attended an SDI-linked CoastCare workshop in Umtata last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workshop sought to create a workable programme for generating development research and focused on issues surrounding coastal management, including access to beaches, land-use planning, dune and estuary management, and limits for off-road vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Workshop facilitator, CoastCare's Hugh Tyrrell, highlighted the importance of utilising already-existing community knowledge in the development process: &quot;Indigenous people have over the years gathered a wealth of knowledge about living with their particular environments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sharing and pooling this indigenous knowledge can lead to a richer understanding all round,&quot; said Tyrrell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, fears about the potential negative impact of &quot;eco- tourism&quot; on local culture and environment have been raised by Professor Peggy Luzwazi of the University of the Transkei. She recently warned the Parliamentary Committee on Arts, Science, Culture and Technology about a tourist- induced culture of begging, bribery and tips, environmental destruction and the alienation of local communities from their land as they sell it to commercial developers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, some commentators are concerned about the SDI's ability to balance the priorities of local communities with macro- economic development policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community Resource Optimisation Programme director Eddy Russell argues that community involvement in SDI planning is not yet happening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The SDI have just fielded their team of facilitators, but I am concerned that no detailed assessment has yet been done. Research into issues like the capacity for accommodation in Mkambati should be ready before the Eastern Cape Investors Conference scheduled for October.&quot; Highlighting the example of the Port St Johns-Port Edward road, Russell asks if the Department of Transport has the R1,8-billion necessary to construct the road, and whether the toll road will be able to generate the R1-million (30 000 cars a day) necessary to pay off the interest alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Should the department not have the money, there is talk about creating concessions where anchor projects such as at Mkambati will be packaged into the road deal. This will severely lessen the bargaining power of these communities, as they will be part of a package deal, rather than retaining ownership over their own project. And besides, what about the communities outside the anchor projects that are not being focused on?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SDI task teams have been set up to deal with these concerns.  Four teams deal with environment, infrastructure, small businesses and land affairs, and all report to a fifth, the Community Participation Co- ordinating Committee, which aims to place community participation at the heart of the SDI policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Various parastatals and NGOs are represented on the task teams, including the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA), the Industrial Development Corporation, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and the Mineral and Energy Policy Centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DBSA's Dave Arkwright argues these task teams and parastatals all help to minimise state intervention and government expenditure, although a R200-million Capital Feed Fund has been set up for all eight SDIs across the country should the government decide that it needs to intervene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole principle of the SDI is to leverage interest from the private sector for underutilised areas with clear development potential. Initial state intervention will show the private sector that government is committed to the SDI, but this must be short- lived. This will leave behind the capacity to continue running the SDI as part of provincial and local government's day-to-day business,&quot; says Arkwright.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The United Nations Human Development Report 1997, released this week, highlights the importance of integrating poverty reduction into economic policies. Only those countries that make &quot;poverty eradication a central objective of their national development policies&quot; will achieve steady and equitable growth in the next century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The positive and negative experiences over the past 50 years are instructive,&quot; says Richard Jolly, special adviser to the UN Development Programme (UNDP), administrator and principal co- ordinator of the report.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Strategies to eradicate poverty are not only key to advancing human development but have proven essential to economic growth policies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poverty has many faces and the UNDP has this year introduced a Human Poverty Index (HPI), which looks at whether people in the developing world have the basic choices and opportunities to lead a long and healthy life and to enjoy a decent standard of living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The HPI measures the percentage of the population expected to survive to age 40; the percentage of illiterates; and lack of access to healthcare, safe water and reasonable nutrition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trinidad and Tobago, Cuba, Chile, Singapore and Costa Rica score highest, having reduced human poverty to less than 10% of their population. On the lowest rankings, where human poverty exceeds 50%, six out of the bottom seven countries are in Africa: Niger, Sierra Leone, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Mali, Cambodia and Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, while great strides have been made in reducing poverty worldwide, most notably in China, sub-Saharan Africa has the greatest incidence of human poverty - and the most rapid growth in human poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, the UNDP believes extreme poverty could be eradicated over the next 20 years, as long as countries implement policies that are &quot;pro-poor&quot;. This would entail addressing structural inequalities in the distribution of assets, such as land, housing and social services; institutional and policy reforms to promote better access and greater security of tenure for women and greater support for agricultural productivity, promoting micro- enterprises and the informal sector, as well as labour-intensive manufacturing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Appealing to JCI's Mzi Khumalo has not helped the NUM in negotiating retrenchments with the mining house, writes Ferial Haffajee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We expected more heart from someone like Mzi; it was a heartless decision,&quot; says the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) deputy general secretary Gwede Mantashe of Mzi Khumalo, JCI's new chair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JCI has decided it must retrench 2900 miners and 750 contractors at its Randfontein Estates gold mine. Now the NUM has declared a dispute with the company on retrenchment packages and its new black owners are getting a taste of the less glitzy side of gold.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Randfontein Estates is a stable of four mines dotted around the mining towns of Krugersdorp and Randfontein. They lie in one of the richest gold belts in the country, but profits have tumbled and management decided in February that one- third of the workforce must go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By this week, many workers had decided to opt for retrenchment packages. Men wrapped in blankets sat pensively inside drafty union offices looking for help to fill in retrenchment application forms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among them was Amos Mthethwa, who has been with JCI for 10 years and earns R1 100 a month. &quot;There's no job security; every year there's retrenchment,&quot; says Mthethwa, who will return to his KwaZulu-Natal home. &quot;I'm very worried; I'll decide what to do when I get home.&quot; He will receive a retrenchment package of about R5500, plus pension for the 10 years he's worked at Randfontein Estates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other miners, such as Victor Motsaathape, are holding out for the higher severance packages that the NUM is trying to negotiate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NUM has demanded four weeks' pay for the first year of service, plus two weeks' pay for every year worked thereafter. JCI is offering 1,8 weeks' pay for every year of service with a minimum of four weeks' severance pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many miners it's not only about money. Motsaathape is qualified for nothing else except mining. If he loses this job, his chances of getting another are slim and he will also lose the comfortable house his family lives in and the free schooling the mine provides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They didn't give us a chance to prepare ourselves,&quot; says Motsaathape. But JCI says there's no time; this week it accused the union of &quot;delaying tactics&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This process cannot be extended indefinitely as the additional cost to the mine, of some R300000 a day, jeopardises the jobs of the remainder of the workforce,&quot; said JCI this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dispute throws up many challenges and some contradictions for black capital, which is investing billions in mining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The industry is in trouble, with mining barons caught between a low gold price and the threatened sale of gold reserves by the world's central banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demands on labour are greater than ever, for on mineworkers' shoulders lies the survival of the industry.  Productivity needs to go up, working practices must change to get the gold that lies far deeper in the ground after decades of prospecting and then there's the unspoken competition from new mines in the rest of Africa, and South America, where reserves are more plentiful and labour much cheaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All this portends more difficult times for labour relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many thousands of mineworkers have lost their jobs in the past decade as the mining industry has shrunk from its former glory as the mainstay of the South African economy. Over the years, the NUM has established procedures to negotiate humane retrenchment packages and it charges that JCI tried to side-step these procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the union turned instead to Khumalo, an old comrade who spent 12 years on Robben Island, but who also now wears the hat of JCI chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a meeting last week at the union's Johannesburg headquarters, old friendships were renewed as NUM president James Motlatsi and Khumalo decided that no retrenchments would take place until the end of June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the way of old friends, the agreement was not signed and sealed, in fact it wasn't even typed up. This week, Khumalo was back in London negotiating a potential merger with Lonrho and the company changed tack, stating that retrenchments would begin as soon as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a question of integrity. There was an agreement,&quot; says Mantashe, whose union is now getting tough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A dispute has been declared with JCI. The Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration will be brought in to find a solution before a legal strike can take place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Capital has no colour; we will deal with JCI just like we deal with any other company,&quot; adds Mantashe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mantashe's tone indicates hurt and surprise, almost as if the union had been banking on easier times from black owners in an industry that has always been hard. Now the mineworkers have learnt otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We expect more brutal tactics from those who know us because they know our tactics,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NUM hopes that new black owners will follow the advice the union gives to officials who go to work for mining companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't forget your roots,&quot; says NUM shop- steward Thabane Mngomezulu.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Amid all Cosatu's and business's bluster lies a danger that the central tenet of Gear - job creation - will be ignored, writes Madeleine Wackernagel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business has until Monday to respond to the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), which threatened continued mass action unless business accedes to its demands over the Basic Conditions of Employment Bill. But business, predictably, is taking as tough a line as the labour movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next step should be another meeting of the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac). But until the parties have something new to discuss there is little point, says Nedlac executive director Jayendra Naidoo. So, if the deadlock continues, it will be up to the Minister of Labour, Tito Mboweni, to find a way out of the impasse.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bill calls for a 45-hour working week, while Cosatu is pressing for 40-hours. Business argues that the additional costs will prohibit job creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The arguments are all academic in a fragmented labour market such as ours,&quot; says one labour analyst. &quot;The private sector is not necessarily the biggest employer and besides, many big businesses already have instituted better conditions than are set out by the new Bill. The biggest problem is that it will inhibit job creation in the informal sector.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says another: &quot;This is just so much hot air. The real question is to what degree the concerns of the unemployed are taken into account in all this bickering.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid all the bluster and posturing lies a danger that the centrepiece of government economic policy, the growth, employment and redistribution (Gear) strategy, is under threat. As it is, there is little to celebrate on the first anniversary of Gear's unveiling. So far, growth has been unremarkable, employment has actually fallen and the income gap is widening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So is the gap between the government and its alliance partners.  Says Cosatu representative Nowetu Mpati: &quot;Gear is not moving ahead because we weren't consulted. It amounts to a business document, which is why it is not being implemented. We are as concerned as everybody else about job creation, but not on these terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody calls on Cosatu and the labour movement to compromise but what about government and labour? Of course we want more jobs but the negotiating process is about give and take - and so far only Cosatu has done the giving. In the past 18 months of negotiations, just one party has done the compromising - us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But says Jeremy Cronin of the South African Communist Party: &quot;It is important that this new Bill goes through as quickly as possible so that we can get on with the real issues. The longer it is delayed, the greater the opportunity for big business to find a way round it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've become bogged down in arguing about Gear and blaming it for all the country's ills. We need to get back to the bigger picture and focus more on industrial policy than on macro-economic issues alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For once business was talking the same language. The need for a co-ordinated approach, involving government, business and labour, is paramount in the battle to create employment opportunities, says one economist. &quot;Redressing the balance of past capital- intensive production won't happen by itself. The government must come up with a comprehensive industrial policy, encompassing trade regimes, regulatory frameworks, education and training, as well as tariffs, export zones and tax incentives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This view is echoed by a Labour Department source: &quot;If job creation is ever going to get off the ground, the government must be pro-active. You can't leave it up to the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Policy must be directed towards labour- intensive production, whether in agriculture or tourism, but it won't happen just like that. The departments must work together at devising an employment strategy, which in turn should work with the new Bill. We want more and better jobs - not just jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a comprehensive policy would also have to address small- business promotion, singled out by Gear for its employment potential. So far, policy has been ad-hoc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Phillip Tekane of the National African Federated Chambers of Commerce: &quot;The government is trying, the spirit is there, but there's a long way to go. Take Khula, for example. It was set up by the Department of Trade and Industry to provide financing for small businesses, but instead, funding is channelled through the banks, which apply very strict criteria to small-business applicants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to find unconventional ways to encourage entrepreneurship and more legislation will only deter people from starting up their own businesses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frustrations are growing but so is awareness. If Gear is to succeed, the Presidential Job Summit scheduled for October will have to be more than just another opportunity for the parties concerned to indulge in rhetoric and self- interest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - More than eight HIV-positive babies are born each day in Namibia and the high rate of Aids-related deaths could reverse the nation's declining infant mortality rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over 3 000 children are born HIV-positive each year in Namibia and the 1997 Namibia Human Development Report (NHDR) projects that by the year 2005 approximately 21 000 children will be orphaned because of Aids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year 52 Namibian babies died due to Aids, accounting for four per cent of the country's infant mortality rate, said the report produced by the United Nations Development Programme.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, released in Windhoek this week, noted that pregnant women infected with HIV/Aids have a 30 per cent chance of passing the disease on to their children</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report stresses &quot;that the progress made by Namibia in reducing Infant Mortality Rate and Child Mortality Rate may be reversed as a result of the Aids epidemic&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although many of these infants live beyond their first birthday, Namibia's infant mortality rate is expected to grow due to the spiralling Aids infection rate among adults - especially pregnant women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1996 more than 15 per cent of of the nation's pregnant women were found to be HIV-positive. This is nearly twice the amount of those screened in 1994 and over four times the 1992 rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NHDR also cited widespread discrimination against women as a major factor in the HIV/Aids epidemic. The disadvantaged social status often imposed upon women enhanced their chances of contracting and spreading the disease, the study said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, as gender equity does not exist for most women - sexual coercion, the need for economic security, and cultural factors often increases the chances of high-risk behaviour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sexual violence against women (as well as children) also compounded the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A staggering 50 per cent of the Namibian youth questioned in a 1996 Youth Health Development Programme (YHDP) survey said that they thought that 'sometimes a boyfriend has to hit a girlfriend so that she will do what he wants'. Nineteen per cent of sexually active young men surveyed admitted to having beaten a women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the severe impact of gender inequity on the Aids epidemic, the NHDR also highlights the effect that the disease has on the nation's youth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the youth surveyed expressed little hope for their future with nine per cent believing that they were likely to be infected with HIV/Aids in the next six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 37 per cent of all Namibians between the ages of 12 and 18 who have had sexual intercourse - 20 per cent have already had more than one partner, the survey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As many as 84 per cent of those surveyed believe their partner has had intercourse with someone else. Half said they had not used a condom during their last encounter while 28 per cent confessed to never having used a condom before.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - There was bad news for the Hospitality Association of Namibia (HAN) yesterday, when Tourism Minister Gert Hanekom announced that their proposals for a wider range of tax incentives had been rejected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HAN has lobbied Government for more than two years on the issue as they believe that, if implemented, their incentive suggestions would provide a much-needed boost to Namibia's tourism industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening HAN's eighth congress, Hanekom said the association's document, Namibian Tourism - A Case For Incentives, was basically regarded as a duplication of the present incentive scheme for manufacturing industries in Namibia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The needs of the manufacturing industry differ significantly from the needs of the tourism industry and the document therefore could not be considered by the Cabinet Committee,&quot; Hanekom told the congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result the document had been referred back to the Ministry of Tourism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have requested the consultants working with our Ministry to devise and suggest specific incentives for the promotion of the tourism industry,&quot; Hanekom said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pointing out several flaws in the document, Hanekom said incentives needed to address the shortcomings of the industry and avoid aspects already fully provided for by existing enterprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also noted that the final decisions and the announcing of any incentives was the prerogative of the Minister of Finance - usually during a budget speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will do our best to finalise this matter, and hopefully the Minister of Finance may be in a position to announce certain incentives during his next budget speech,&quot; Hanekom said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dissatisfaction was clearly visible when HAN's outgoing chairman, Johnie Hamman, thanking Hanekom after his speech, said the Minister had had an &quot;unpleasant task&quot; since the issue had been &quot;nagging at the hearts of the industry for a long time&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will be up to the association to go back to its consultants. But it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain high standards,&quot; Hamman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the incentive proposals was a 50 per cent tax abatement on taxable income derived from tourism enterprises for 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HAN said the Foreign Investment Act offered a wide range of general incentives for foreign investors but that it tended to favour manufacturing enterprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They proposed that the Act be changed to also provide for tourism enterprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among others, the industry wants a 50 per cent tax abatement on taxable income from tourism enterprises for five years to be phased out on a straight line basis over a subsequent period of 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also proposed that new companies should be free to negotiate special packages with the Tourism Ministry which, in turn, would make appropriate representations to the Ministry of Finance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another proposal called for special write-off provisions for buildings erected by tourism enterprises: 20 per cent over the first year and eight per cent a year of the balance over 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HAN also suggested that any renovations be written off in the year in which they were carried out. The accelerated write-off of capital costs of buildings would encourage investment in accommodation facilities and other infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 75 per cent tax exemption on income spent on tourism advertising and marketing research in a foreign country was also proposed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liebenberg said the law had been broken and the Police and the judiciary should have been allowed to decide on the matter, and not Nujoma or the Inspector of Hospitals and Health Facilities, Dr Iyambo Indongo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Appointing Dr Indongo does not conform with the constitutional method of investigating criminal deeds. Allow Nampol to perform their duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Constitution of the Republic of Namibia, every accused person will be heard in a free, fair and competent public court. The President and Dr Indongo do not satisfy this constitutional requirement,&quot; Liebenberg said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For his part, Whitham said his actions in exposing the dubious sealing activities were not politically motivated but part of his civic responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described the State House response as &quot;preposterous and not worthy of any serious contemplation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The facts are that I saw and smelled an illegal operation being conducted which was a public health hazard and reported it to the authorities as is my civil duty,&quot; Whitham responded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed out that although State House admitted that the seal processing operation was indeed unauthorised, illegal and contravened health regulations, it had prevented action against the perpetrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whitham refuted allegations that he had supplied photographs to the Times of London and added State House must be &quot;confused&quot;.  The Times had never published any photographs of the suspect seal meat operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I supplied photographs to Dr Jan Jurgens (of the Ministry of Marine Resources), the health authorities, department of sea fisheries, the Police and the International Fund for Animal Welfare,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State House on Wednesday announced that the 'experiment' to establish whether seal meat can be processed for human consumption had been terminated pending the granting of a permit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State House statement did not address concerns about the alleged insanitary state of the seal meat plant and possible health risks to town residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead the statement launched a personal attack on Whitham whom it accused of trying to sensationalise the issue by contacting the media before the matter had been dealt with by health authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State House said Nujoma had been satisfied with the outcome of the investigations by Indongo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seal meat operation was set up by the seal concessionaire at Cape Cross, Aldred Brink. It was hastily abandoned once reported to the authorities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - Two Policemen stationed at the former Buffalo military base in West Caprivi are to face charges of poaching and the violation of firearm restrictions, among others, a Police spokesperson confirmed to The Namibian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nampol's Chief Inspector Hophni Hamufungu said the case was being probed by Detective Sergeant Mukube from Rundu. He added that the two suspects would also be suspended.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the suspects, Protection Officer Mungeri, is charged with poaching a buffalo, illegally hunting in a protected nature conservation area and with using trapping apparatus to ensnare game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His co-accused, Protection Officer Temba, is being charged with possessing buffalo meat and in violation of the Nature Conservation Ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently Temba was found &quot;cooking and eating buffalo meat&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamufungu said Police at Rundu had informed him that they &quot;are still at the beginning of the investigation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said some members of the Police unit guarding the former military facility would have to be transferred to Rundu, including the two accused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite being suspended the two will be put under the direct supervision of the Rundu office,&quot; the NamPol spokesperson added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detective Sergeant Mukube last week met with Environment and Tourism officials who blew the whistle on the Policemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier last week game rangers stationed in the area told The Namibian about the seizure of fresh and dried wild venison and said they were considering laying charges against the Policemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officials acted on a tip-off from their network of informers and pounced on the Policemen while they were feasting on the game meat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Hamufungu denied claims by members of the Kxoe community that they were being harassed and victimised by members of the Buffalo Police unit.The Kxoe have said that impromptu house searches were being conducted in their houses on the grounds that cops were looking for fire-arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Hamufungu, the house raids not only targeted the Kxoe people, but also other tribal groups, and that they formed part of routine Police searches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Police spokesperson revealed that in 1996 a record 53 illegal fire-arms, mostly old army issues, were impounded from members of the Kxoe community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far this year five unlicensed weapons had been impounded from the community, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hamufungu added that this had resulted in a number of dockets for illegal possession of fire-arms being opened against some Kxoe &quot;who are not co-operating with the Police and they are not happy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Hamufungu said the searches had the blessing of the Kxoe traditional leadership, last week members of the Kxoe traditional leadership complained about what they termed the harassment and victimisation of their people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The Background of Post-Fascist Italy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The struggle for the return to Ethiopia of the Aksum obelisk, looted by the Italian Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini in 1937, is at long last apparently reaching a successful, and auspicious, conclusion. The time has therefore perhaps come for some of those involved in that struggle to publish views, and reminiscences, on the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fascist Legacy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was apparent to any serious observer of Post World War II Europe that Italy at the end of the war was still deeply influenced by its Fascist past. Despite the growth of the Italian Communist party, perhaps the strongest in the world, many Italians could not free themselves from their country's Fascist legacy. The Communists were more successful, but were no less principled in matters colonial, for they were quite prepared to give support to Italy's return to Africa if it would win votes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">War Crimes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Italians, &quot;educated&quot; by 20 years of Fascism, with a rigidly controlled press, failed to understand that Fascist Italy's invasion of Ethiopia was not a &quot;Civilising Mission&quot;.  They did not realise that Fascists had been guilty of war crimes. Italy's failure to understand this was in no small part the fault of the victorious Allies, who promoted the retention in power of Mussolini's immediate successor, Marshal Pietro Badoglio. As the Italian commander at the time of the Fascist invasion of Ethiopia in 1935-6 had been responsible for the extensive use of poison-gas but, after Mussolin's fall, received the support of the British and Americans, who, preoccupied with the Cold War, were supremely uninterested in promoting historical justice in relation to Ethiopia. The British in particular consistently opposed any attempt to try Italians for war crimes committed during the invasion of Ethiopia, insisting that it was &quot;another war&quot;. Nay, they went further. There was the occasion, little-known, but fully documented in the British Foreign Office archives, when the British Embassy in Rome actually gave Badoglio asylum to prevent him being apprehended by the post-war Italian authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus was it that though the Allies instigated show trials for German and Japanese war criminals, not one Italian was ever tried for a crime in Ethiopia (though there can be no denying that many such crimes occurred). Italy, unlike Germany and Japan, was in this way denied the political education afforded by war crimes trials. Many Italians, denied access to the truth during Fascism, were left ignorant of the fact that their compatriots had been guilty of any atrocities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poison Gas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The post-war Italian Government, like its Fascist predecessor, furthermore consistently refused to admit that the Royal Italian Air Force had ever used poison-gas in Ethiopia. It was indeed not until 1995, almost exactly sixty years after the event, that the Italian Ministry of Defence finally admitted that gas had been used: on this see Angelo Del Boca's recent important study, I gas di Mussolini. Il fascismo e la guerra d'Etiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colonialism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another consequence of Italy's failure fully to break with its Fascist past can be seen in the question of the ex-Italian colonies: Eritrea, Somalia and Libya. The post-World War British and French Governments, under pressure from unquenchable nation- liberation movements, were coming, albeit grudgingly, to recognise the inevitability of the end of colonialism. The Post- War Italian Government, by contrast, adopted a colonially grasping attitude, reminiscent of the Scramble for Africa, and struggled actively to regain the former Italian colonies. Italy was thus significantly out-of-step with much of colonial Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British Premier Harold Macmillan, referring to decolonisation in Africa, coined the famous term &quot;Winds of Change&quot;. His Italian contemporary, Count Sforza, was quoted as declaring, very differently, &quot;Gentlemen of Europe, you have lost Asia by your stupidity; see that you do not lose Africa also!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fascist Residue</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Symptomatic of Italian continuity, in relation to Ethiopia and the ex-colonies, was the case of Enrico Cerulli, the leading Italian expert on Ethiopia (and unquestionably a scholar of distinction). In the immediate aftermath of the Wal Wal incident of 1934, which Mussolini had used as a pretext for the invasion of Ethiopia, Cerulli served as adviser to the Fascist delegation to the League of Nations. The delegation's objective was to gain time for Mussolini to build up his invasion forces unhampered by League action.. Cerulli later served as Vice Governor of Italian East Africa under Mussolini. Later again he served as adviser to the post-Fascist Italian Government, during its attempt, at the Paris Peace Conference of 1946, to regain Italy's former colonies. It was no less symptomatic that the Italian delegation to that conference had the effrontery to distribute a fascist publication entitled La civilisation fascist en Afrique Orientale Italienne, a highly partisan work, describing Italian construction and other activity in Ethiopia, which had been published by Mussolini's Government in 1943, the twenty-first year of the Fascist Era, as the title page stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Italian Peace Treaty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the strength of the Fascist legacy, post-war Italian Governments, almost inevitably, displayed little good faith, in relation to either Ethiopia or the former Italian colonies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by the Peace Treaty, of 1947, Italy was obliged to renounce its African colonies. However, on the day after signing the agreement, the Italian Government gave orders to despatch delegations all over the world, in a diplomatic drive to regain the very colonies over which it had renounced claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Treaty likewise made provision for the trial of Italians charged with war crimes in Ethiopia. When, however, in the absence of diplomatic relations between Italy and Ethiopia, the Ethiopian Minister in London, Ato Abebe Retta, attempted to deliver a note on the matter to the Italian Embassy in London, on 6 September 1949, the Italian Ambassador refused to accept it. This the Ambassador, according to &quot;The Times&quot;, had the right in international law to do, but was scarcely in keeping with the spirit of the Peace Treaty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was, and, as far as I know, still is, symptomatic that the film of the Libyan patriot Omar al-Muktar, murdered on orders from the Italian colonial commander Graziani, has never been shown in Italian cinemas.Lutz Becker's notable documentary film &quot;Lion of Judah&quot;, depicting the Ethiopian war (and available at the British Council in Addis Ababa) has likewise been denied the exposure in Italy which it deserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Missing Crowns, the Lion of Judah statue, and the Aksum Obelisk</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Italian Government's lack of good faith was no less apparent in the question of loot. The Peace Treaty specified, in Article 37, that Italy, within 18 months, should return to Ethiopia all loot taken after 3 October 1935, i.e. the date of the fascist invasion. The post-war Italian Government was, here too, scarcely distinguished for its cooperation. There was, on the contrary, much prevarication. Mussolini, when captured by Italian Partisans at Dongo, near the Swiss frontier, in April 1944, had been in possession of four Ethiopian gold crowns.  These were duly photographed, but then mysteriously disappeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confronted by this loss of what should have been some of the most valuable items of loot due for return under Article 37, a Government wishing to display honorable intent would surely have hastened, as fast as possible, to return the remainder of the loot. Instead of this, the Italian Government, if we can believe the testimony of Ato Emanuel Abraham, Ethiopian Ambassador in Rome from 1952 to 1955, was almost insultingly uncooperative. In his recent autobiography, &quot;Reminiscences of My Life&quot;, he recalls how officials of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs told him that the statue of the Lion of Judah, looted from Ethiopia, and then in Rome, could not be found. This caused him to reply that of course the Italian Government could not find it if they did not look for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the Aksum Obelisk, Ato Emanuel also recalls, in vivid detail, how the Italian Government persistently tried to evade his requests for its return. When he raised the matter with Mendola, the Director-General of the Ministry, the latter &quot;stared at the floor for about one minute but could not bring himself to utter one word&quot;. Another Foreign Affairs official suggested that the obelisk should be retained in Rome, with a small notice to say that it was a &quot;Gift from the Ethiopian People&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question of the obelisk could not, however, be dismissed so easily. A dramatic, and entirely unexpected, manoeuvre was, as we shall see next week, soon to take place!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - A dazzling jazz performance was presented by a group of Italian musicians at the Italian Cultural Institute last Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Present at the concert were prominent figures including the Italian Ambassador, H.E. Mr. Maurizio Melani, the Canadian ambassador, H.E. Mr. Gabriel Lessard, the Yugoslav Ambassador, H. E. Mr. Igor Jovovic and many other distinguished personalities from Ethiopia and abroad.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attendence proved that the Ethiopian community is keen toward jazz music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world renowned jazz composer , Giorgio Gaslini, put on two solo superb piano performances that left the audience spellbound. The group which included Andrea Dulbecco at the vibraphone, Roberto Bonati at bass and Barbara Mavilla at the drum presented around eight pieces that featured both the festive and the dark side of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concert was unique to the Ethiopians as the talented Giorgio Gaslini presented a magnificent musical piece which he wrote nearby Lake Hora about 45 km from Addis Ababa. The music completely captured the hearts and the minds of the audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia's own vibraphone player, Mulatu Astatcke, also presented a magnificent musical piece during the presentation.  The crowd was enthusiastic about the performance shown by the drummer, Barbara Mavilia, whose expert handling of the drums was a performance that one must not miss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giorgoi Gaslini's final solo made use of the unusual combination of a piano with musical box to create a music that was delightful to the ears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, a statement made by one distinguished guest after the concert captures the essence of the program. He said, &quot;I wish I had a family here to see the concert.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The credit should go to the Italian Cultural Institute which is one of the active groups in Addis Ababa that initiates activities for the promotion of culture.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Ato Moges Admassu is one of the few Ethiopians who give the information service its rightful place - a place of prominence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Being a veteran computer engineer and the manager in the internationally renowned computer brand name of the Hewlett Packard Computer branch in Ethiopia, Ato Moges is an authority to talk of the information issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Moges, 49, had as a child, always felt that vocational training would go a long way toward success in life. He grew up under the influence of his father who used to tell him an educated person will never sleep hungry and that knowledge is something that nobody takes away from some one. These sayings guided him to undertake vocational training. He joined Addis Ababa University and graduated in 1978 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Collected and full of confidence, Moges sits still while talking of the complexities and pleasure of life. Moges is the product of trainings he had in different countries such as France, the United Kingdom, Japan and Poland. Talking of the various trainings he had taken during the early stages of his career, Ato Moges said his time in France was mainly devoted to HP 3000 hardware and network training, while in the U.K.  training focused on UNIX.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His stay in Japan greatly influenced his career while he was studying microwaves. What impressed Moges most in Japan at that time (late 1970's) was the way the Japanese used to sell computer chips, transistors and so on, in the streets just as seasoning spices are sold in the streets of Ethiopia. In Poland, he was trained in broadcasting technology which he said was not beneficial for him, for the computer hardware used in the training course was not modern and up-to-date. Moges remembered how he used to try to fix the out-of-date computers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information to Ato Moges is part of the ongoing process of development. Factors of production do not only include the three components of manpower, capital and land. It also incorporates a fourth most important component, that is, information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without information, Moges affirms, individuals, businessmen and even the government will be in a dark alley. Just like food and water, an individual needs information in order to survive in the present world. More importantly, Ato Moges emphasised the need for the right information at the right time in the right way. Wrong information, says he smilingly, &quot;is like dirty water that causes stomach upset to the person who drank it.&quot; Water, a life-giving resource, is turned to something that is harmful to the human body. In the same way, wrong or distorted information is the cause for the many obstacles that face the world at large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moges sees Ethiopia lagging behind in the development of information services. Particularly, in the field of computers, the country is at its infancy. Although the hardware are available and computers are being imported in great numbers, the optimum use of computer services are desired. He mentioned, for instance, the recent introduction of Internet in the Ethiopian information services. The Internet is only used for collection of news, a position which other African countries have long passed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Ethiopians view computer as something to be feared rather than a utility machine to be used and made to work. The cause, in Moges' view, is lack of exposure. Talking of the purchase of computers, he sees many people buying computers because others have already bought it or because it was the &quot;latest&quot;. Fortunately, situations have improved with many computer training centers and institutions that have mushroomed in the last 3-4 years. Brand confusion that mostly characterise selling of computers are being cleared up. Ato Moges recalls the time when IBM brand computer was taken as synonym for all computers. Change is the order of the day when a brand name like Hewlett Packard is becoming a household name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his 13 years experience as computer engineer and manager of ACPSERIC, Ato Moges has worked as the representative in many African countries such as Sudan, Tanzania, Rwandaand Mali. He greatly regrets that Ethiopian engineers who are given contracts in such countries as Sudan and Rwanda are unable to work because of certain polices.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - A breakthrough research has proved the possibility of replacing steel bars by bamboo for concrete reinforcement, announced the Ethiopian Science and Technology Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Ato Shumu Tefera, head of the industry department at the commission, research conducted on the huge amount of bamboo found in the western part of Ethiopia proved that the resource has the standard quality needed for concrete reinforcement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such innovative use of the bamboo for construction purpose could cover the shortage of steel bars beside minimising the country's foreign currency, Ato Shemu added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another research also proved successful by proving the possibility of producing pesticides and insecticides from pyrethrum, a flowering plant species which grows in the highland regions, he disclosed. This production will also go a long way towards the saving of foreign currency the country is spending on the import of pesticides, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young researchers under the sponsorship of the government came up with various tool inventions, among which is a multicrop thresher. The thresher proved to be effective by the commission, has the capacity of threshing 10 quintals per hour, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tool will remain effective as its spare parts are easily available in the country at reasonable prices, Ato Shemu added.</SPAN></P>
