<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA - War and the high spending by governments on defence slowed down the implementation of the Beijing Platform in Africa, the former Secretary General of the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Getrude Mongella, who is now president of a lobbying group, Advocacy for Women in Africa, says conflicts continue to drain countries of resources that should have been used for development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the last two years, some 15 conflicts have been raging in Africa. According to a United Nations report, Fighting Retreat- Military Power And Other Barriers to Africa's Democratic Transition, Ethiopia, for example, spends US $ 128 million annually on its military.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hannah Tiagha, Social Affairs officer of the African Centre for Women at the UN Economic Commission for Africa ECA in Addis, says the ongoing conflict in Angola, for example, has had grave consequences on development programmes to empower women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Illiteracy among women in Angola is high since only about 55.9 percent of the school-age population continues schooling after Grade Four, of which 17.6 percent are girls. Tiagha says health and education programmes have come to a standstill. &quot;Because of the high insecurity in the rural areas, most doctors work in the capital city and the literacy campaign has been largely hampered&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ethiopia's rural areas, early marriages, the distance to school, insecurity in some areas, and household responsibilities continue to be reasons that girls do not attend school, according to the Prime Minister's Office. Only one out of five pregnant women in the country have access to antenatal clinics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While conflict has setback development gains for women and girls in many countries, Tiagha says that some progress has been made after Beijing. &quot;Governments are trying to live up to their commitments. Many countries have prioritise to uplift women from poverty and recognise the importance of improving health services,&quot; Tiagha adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the ECA's African Centre for Women, almost every country in Africa has developed a national action plan to implement the recommendations in the Beijing Platform and in the regional platform for action adopted in Dakar, Senegal in 1994. Mongella also cites some countries which are changing laws to protect women's rights, even to own and inherit land. In many African countries, customary practices dictate that land and property can only be inherited by males.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a lot going on, but it is not enough, because the problems have been there for decades, and you don't expect them to end suddenly,&quot; Mongella says. Most governments complain of shortage of funds to implement the Bejing Platform, Tiagha adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African countries will review how far they have gone since Beijing at a regional meeting under the auspices of the ECA to be held in November. Next June at the United Nations, the world community will review the Beijing Platform for Action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paris - An event organised by UNESCO entitled The Thread Magicians, to be held at Organisation Headquarters from September 28 to October 7, will present the work of African weavers from Benin, Cameroon, Gabon, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal and Uganda. Activities will include a fashion show, an exhibition, conferences and a round table on the theme of micro-finance in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Open to fashion and traditional crafts professionals, the fashion show (October 4, 7 p.m., Room I) staged by Bibi Russell, a designer from Bangladesh and promoter of the &quot;Fashion for Development&quot; programme, along with the exhibition (September 28 to October 7, Salle des Pas Perdus) will promote local designers - including Ly Dumas, Linda Ampah, Alphadi - who work using textiles manufactured by traditional African craftsmen. The Thread Magicians aims to promote the craftsmen's traditional know-how, valorise their cultural identity and open up new markets up for them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The round table discussion (October 4, 3-6 p.m., Room II) - which will be held in the presence of UNESCO Director-General Federico Mayor - will look at the marketing constraints faced by micro-entrepreneurs and draw conclusions. The theme for discussion will be &quot;African weavers faced with local and international markets&quot; and will include three sections: Culture and Development, UNESCO and the Fashion for Development programme; Weavers and Markets; National and International Policies in favour of Weavers. The conferences (October 5, Room II) will have the themes: &quot;Weaving, heritage: what future for African weavers?&quot; (9.30 a.m. to 1 p.m.) and &quot;The Development of Micro-financing in Africa&quot; (3-6 p.m.). Experts in micro-financing in Africa, as well as in Bangladesh and in Bolivia - two countries where micro-finance is particularly developed - as well as the Culture Ministers for Ivory Coast (Zadi Zahourou), Mali (Aminata Traore) and Senegal (Abdoulaye Elimane Kane) will be present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event - which is part of the framework of the United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006) - aims to highlight the link between cultural wealth and economic and social development. It also aims to reduce poverty, by giving craftsmen the means to progress via easier access to credit and the opening up of new markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Fashion for Development&quot; strategy - developed by UNESCO to promote micro-enterprises and traditional craftsmanship; strengthen ties between craftsmen, designers and fashion houses; and facilitate their access to the international market - has already been marked by three major events: Weavers of Bangladesh (February 1996), Displaced Women, victims of the war in Bosnia (December 1997) and Latin America's Indigenous Weavers (March 1999).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations - Expressing grave concern at the deteriorating situation in the Great Lakes region of Africa, in particular in eastern Zaire, the Security Council this afternoon called for an immediate cease-fire and a complete cessation of all fighting in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement read out on its behalf by the President of the Council, Nugroho Wisnumurti (Indonesia), the Council called on all States to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of neighbouring States in accordance with their obligations under the Charter. In that connection the Council urged all parties to refrain from the use of force as well as cross- border incursions and to engage in the process of negotiations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It noted the effect which the continued fighting was having on the inhabitants of the region and condemned all acts of violence, and spoke of the urgent need for a comprehensive and coordinated response by the international community to prevent any further escalation of the crisis. By the text of the statement, the Council supported the Secretary- General's initiative to dispatch to the Great Lakes region a Special Envoy to consult with all concerned in order to establish the facts relating to the present conflict; to develop a plan to defuse tension and establish a cease- fire; to promote a process of negotiation; and to submit advice on the mandate to be given to a United Nations Special Representative including on the size and structure of a possible United Nations political presence in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Special Envoy should be provided with adequate staff and logistic resources, according to the statement. The Council called on all concerned to cooperate fully with the Special Envoy and expressed the hope that he would travel to the region as soon as possible. The Security Council urged governments of the region to pursue early and substantive dialogue without further delay and welcomed all regional efforts aimed at defusing the tension in the region. It also stated that the situation in eastern Zaire had underlined the need to organize a conference on peace, security and development in the Great Lakes region under the auspices of the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To that end, it called on the Secretary-General to ask the Special Envoy to promote the convening of a conference on an urgent basis. The Council, particularly concerned at the humanitarian situation and resulting large- scale movements of refugees and displaced persons, called on all parties in the region to allow humanitarian agencies and non-governmental organizations to deliver humanitarian assistance to those in need and to ensure the safety of all refugees, as well as that of international humanitarian personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting, which began at 3:50 p.m., was adjourned at 3:59 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The full text of the Presidential Statement, which will be issued as document S/PRST/1996/44, reads as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Security Council is gravely concerned at the deteriorating situation in the Great Lakes region, in particular eastern Zaire, and at the effect which the continued fighting is having on the inhabitants of the region and condemns all acts of violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It underlines the urgent need for a comprehensive and coordinated response by the international community to prevent any further escalation of the crisis there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Security Council calls for an immediate cease-fire and a complete cessation of all fighting in the region. The Council calls on all States to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of neighbouring States in accordance with their obligations under the United Nations Charter. In this connection, it urges all parties to refrain from the use of force as well as cross-border incursions and to engage in a process of negotiation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Security Council, in the light of the letters of the Secretary- General to the President of the Council (S/1996/875 and S/1996/878), and the information received from the High Commissioner for Refugees and the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights regarding the situation in eastern Zaire, is particularly concerned at the humanitarian situation and the resulting large-scale movements of refugees and displaced persons. It fully supports the efforts of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and humanitarian agencies to alleviate the suffering. It calls on all parties in the region to allow humanitarian agencies and non-governmental organizations to deliver humanitarian assistance to those in need and to ensure the safety of all refugees as well as the security and freedom of movement of all international humanitarian personnel. It underlines the urgent need for the orderly voluntary repatriation and resettlement of refugees, and the return of displaced persons, which are crucial elements for the stability of the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Security Council agrees with the Secretary-General that the situation in eastern Zaire constitutes a serious threat to the stability of the Great Lakes region. It is convinced that the complex problems at issue can be resolved only through early and substantive dialogue. The Council urges the governments of the region to pursue such a dialogue without further delay in order to defuse the tension. The Council calls upon all States in the region to create the conditions necessary for the speedy and peaceful resolution of the conflict, and to desist from any acts that may further exacerbate the situation. In this context, the Council welcomes all regional efforts aimed at defusing tension in the region, in particular the announcement of the meeting of regional leaders scheduled for 5 November 1996 in Nairobi, Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Security Council fully supports the initiative of the Secretary- General to dispatch to the Great Lakes region a Special Envoy to consult with all concerned in order to establish the facts relating to the present conflict; to develop as a matter of urgency a plan to defuse tension and establish a cease-fire; to promote a process of negotiation; and to submit advice on the mandate to be given to a United Nations Special Representative including on the size and structure of a United Nations political presence which, in consultation with the governments and parties concerned, will be established in the Great Lakes region. The Council also considers that the Special Envoy should be provided with adequate staff and logistic resources in order to carry out his mission. The Council also expresses the hope that the mediation efforts of the Organization of African Unity and the European Union will complement those of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General.  The Council calls upon all governments and parties concerned to cooperate fully with the mission of the Special Envoy, and to contribute to the search for a comprehensive solution to the problems facing the people of the Great Lakes region. Given the urgency of the situation, the Council expresses the hope that the Special Envoy will travel as soon as possible to the region and provide early information on the situation there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Security Council reiterates that the present situation in eastern Zaire underlines the need to organize a conference on peace, security and development in the Great Lakes region under the auspices of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity. To this end, it calls on the Secretary-General to ask his Special Envoy to promote the convening and to encourage the adequate preparation of such a conference on an urgent basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documents before Council</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it met this afternoon to consider the situation in eastern Zaire, the Council had before it letters from the Secretary-General to the President of the Council dated 14 October (document S/1996/875) and 24 October (document S/1996/878).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first letter, the Secretary-General states that the deteriorating situation in Zaire required him to offer his good offices to assist the Government of Zaire in addressing the political and security aspects of the problems in the eastern part of the country, not only because of the threat they presented to peace and the security of the region but also because of the negative impact on the United Nations efforts to provide assistance to the elections planned for 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his second letter, reporting on the escalating military activity within Zaire and across its borders, the Secretary-General says that the failure to address the root causes of the conflicts in the region of the Great Lakes, in political and economic as well as security terms, had once again unleashed a spiral of violence and human suffering that may spin out of control unless urgent measures were taken immediately to contain the situation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) - Despite its unrealized potential for huge crop production, livestock rearing could be the jewel in the crown of Sudan's farming activity. But achieving this, too, has also run into difficulty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the face of the facts, Sudan's 102 million head of livestock, Africa's largest, is a warranty for the country's self sufficiency in meat and milk.  The livestock includes 30 million cattle and 37 million sheep. Goats, camels and poultry make up the rest. Out of all this, Sudan earns 60 million U.S.  dollars a year in exports.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can export an annual one million heads of sheep,&quot; says Kindi Yousif, the under-secretary of the commerce ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But marketing these produce appears to be Sudan's primary problem. For example, although the country is the world's leading exporter of sheep to Saudi Arabia, it needs new markets for Sudanese beef other than the traditional Arabian and North African markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite its vast wealth of cattle and sheep, Sudan can barely satisfy its domestic demand for milk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of the milk department at the ministry of animal wealth, Layla Kambal, says Sudan produces about six million tons of milk every year, one- third of which is consumed in the urban areas. The rest, she says, is consumed by herders and lactating animals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Consumption of milk per individual is 74.6 kilograms (169 pounds) per annum,&quot; she adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan is trying to produce an additional 540,000 tons of milk under the Gezira scheme, named after an area just south of Khartoum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The milk produced in Sudan is not available to the urban population. This is because of difficulty in transporting the commodity across Sudan's 2.5 million square kilometers (965,000 square miles) So, Sudan has to import an unspecified quantity of dry milk to meet the shortfall in its major cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A project to cross-breed Sudan's Kenana and Butana cattle (which produce 15 liters (26 pints) of milk per day) with European Frezians has failed to produce the expected quantity of fresh milk. The hybrid, known as Hajeen, produces just 35 liters (62 pints) of milk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kambal says that the lack of agricultural extension is responsible for this low milk productivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Herders keep animals for social status and are concerned with numbers rather than quality and productivity,&quot; she says. Fishing, too, provides another potential source of protein and wealth for the nation. Sudan has two million hectares of inland waters that provide favorable conditions for fisheries, in addition to 720 kilometers (abut 450 miles) of fish-rich coast on the Red Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fish stock assessment is estimated at 100,000 tons. Of this, the annual catch of 45,000 tons is consumed locally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, a recent satellite remote sensing survey conducted over the Upper Nile, the northern part of southern Sudan, by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation, has proved the availability of an additional 72, 000 tons of fish in the White Nile and Sobat rivers. Sudan's fish reserve can, therefore, be said to stand at 172,000 tons annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The director of fisheries in the Sudan ministry of animal wealth, Mohammed Khair Hassan, says that a Canadian firm will in November put out tenders -- on behalf of the Khartoum government -- worth 168-million U.S. dollars to produce an annual 40,000 tons of tuna, 30,000 tons of shrimps and 60,000 tons of fish feed along the Red Sea coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If successful, the scheme will enable the country to export fish and fish feed worth 250 million dollars each year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe, who met in the Burkinabe capital the United States assistant secretary of state for African affairs, George Moose, said he hoped the idea would be discussed further within the context of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) organ on politics, defence and security, which he chairs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the SADC chairman, South African President Nelson Mandela, had since briefed him on the talks he held with the US secretary of state, Warren Christopher, and agreed that &quot;what was required was to find time to discuss it in our forum of (the SADC) organ on politics, defence and security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president said it was important the proposed force be part of existing armies and not operate as an independent unit, as this would create operational problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The majority of the countries have accepted the idea in principle, but the modalities need to be worked out. We are all agreed that as long as the units are part of our armies, there is nothing to worry, but if they are going to be independent...then we are going to have problems,&quot; Mugabe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were also different opinions on how such a force would be deployed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American proposals call for the creation of a 10,000-strong inter- african force to intervene to set up safe havens for civilians during any conflict on the continent, with finance from developed nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Organisation of African Unity and some African leaders have reacted cautiously to the idea, insisting that the proposals should come from Africans themselves rather than from outside the continent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNITED NATIONS (PANA) - The United Nations special envoy to the Great Lakes region of East Africa, Raymond Chretien, says his immediate task is to help achieve a cease-fire in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking Thursday in New York, after meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who appointed him on Wednesday, Chretien said his mandate was difficult but promised to do his best.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is an extraordinarily complex situation, an extraordinarily difficult mandate but I will give it my best shot,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This task will be to help stop the current fighting between the ethnic Tutsi rebels, known as the Banyamulenge living in eastern Zaire, and the country's forces. The hostilities threaten to draw in other countries of the region into the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chretien, who is Canada's ambassador to the United States, said his knowledge of the Great Lakes area and the personalities involved in the crisis would increase the chances of succeeding in his mission, expected to last one month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know the region,&quot; he said. &quot;I was ambassador to the three countries concerned (Zaire, Rwanda and Burundi). I know the players,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chretien said he would meet with all the &quot;decision makers&quot; involved in the dispute, which started when Zaire tried to expel the Banyamulenge, who have lived in Zaire for about 200 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his first stop after leaving New York next week would be Lausanne, Switzerland, where he will meet with Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko who is recuperating from prostate cancer surgery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chretien said that in view of the urgency of the situation, he would start making contacts, immediately, with the leaders of countries in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The S.G. (secretary-general) is already in touch with all the leaders of the region to tell them of my arrival, to tell them precisely of the points that I intend to raise with each and everyone of them,&quot; Chretien said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from helping to arrange a cease-fire, Chretien is also mandated to explore the possibility of convening a regional conference to help defuse the tension in the region. He will advise Boutros-Ghali on the size and nature of the U.N. political presence there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fighting has already created a humanitarian crisis in the region. At least 500,000 Hutu have fled 12 refugee camps to escape the fighting.  Artillery and machine gun exchanges between Rwandan and Zairian forces earlier in the week threatened to escalate the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire has accused Rwanda's Tutsi-dominated military of arming and supporting the Banyamulenges, a charge which Rwanda denies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (PANA) - Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has said the World Trade Organisation (WTO) should not insist on leveling global trade without giving developing countries time to reform economies to enable them to compete with the industrialized nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe, who will chair the sixth annual summit of the G-15 developing countries beginning Sunday in Harare, told the Zimbabwe news agency, Ziana, that it was unfair for the WTO to talk about removing barriers to trade when developing countries were already marginalized on the international market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said developing member countries of the WTO, the successor to the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT), were already operating in an uneven global trading environment characterized by restricted access to markets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe said among other issues at the G-15 summit will be &quot;our fears that the WTO is insisting on having a level playing field&quot; which would disadvantage poor countries because of the level of economic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The WTO cannot create an even ground. The WTO must first recognize that we must take steps that are necessary to raise our economies to the same level as developed countries, then we can talk of an even field,&quot; Mugabe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the G-15 summit will also discuss attempts by developing countries to attract new investment and technology, as well as increase trade among themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit will discuss how the debt crisis affecting many countries could be solved, and this could include appeals for debt forgiveness by multilateral organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope that we can examine such issues as increasing investment in our countries, raising the level of trade and co-operation between and among ourselves, and also try to attract as much technology as possible to our countries and improve our information and communication systems,&quot; Mugabe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The debt situation could be ameliorated by appeals to the developed countries to forgive debts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe said the G-15 forum was an important vehicle for discussing economic and political problems affecting developing countries and promoting South- South co-operation, and also finding ways of achieving equitable relations with the North.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least five heads of state and government have confirmed they will attend the Harare summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current G-15 members are Argentina, Algeria, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, Mexico, Jamaica, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Senegal, Venezuela, Peru, Yugoslavia and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last summit of the G-15, created at the 1989 non-aligned movement summit in Belgrade, was held in Argentina.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - An estimated 1,000 Rwandan refugees have entered Zambia since last September after fleeing their camps in eastern Zaire in the wake of fighting in the area between Rwandan ethnic Tutsis and Zairian soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia's commissioner of refugees in the home affairs ministry, Lameck Mwaba, was quoted Friday by the government-owned Times of Zambia newspaper as saying that the refugees had been forced to trek into Zambia following escalating violence and increased insecurity in eastern Zaire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority of the refugees were reported to be coming in by ship to Zambia's Mpulungu harbour on Lake Tanganyika in the north. Others are said to cross by land into Zambia's Northern Luapula region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwaba said that his office is considering setting up a refugee camp in the area to cut down on costs to transport the refugees to Meheba refugee camp, the country's major refugee resettlement center in the country's north- western region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fighting has sparked off a wave of refugee movement which United Nations officials have said could surpass Rwanda's own migration during that country's 1994 ethnic strife pitting the majority Hutus and the minority Tutsis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some one million Rwandans, mainly Tutsis and some &quot;moderate&quot; Hutus were estimated to have been killed in the 1994 massacres and two million others forced to flee to neighboring Zaire, Tanzania and Zambia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (PANA) - Zimbabwean and Ethiopian leaders have called for new initiatives to end the carnage in eastern Zaire, where Tutsi rebels are causing havoc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a meeting in Ougadougou, President Robert Mugabe and Prime Minister Meles Zenawi discussed the worsening political crisis in the Great Lakes region, where Tusti rebels have seized a swathe of Zairian territory and are battling to take Goma airport, threatening relief supplies to more than a million Hutu refugees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two leaders, who were in the Burkinabe capital attending the Global Coalition for Africa, met for more than 30 minutes and, among other bilateral issues, discussed the situation in Zaire, as well as the crisis in Somalia, Burundi and Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe told Zimbabwean journalists the situation in Zaire was &quot;worrying us quite a lot&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe said Zenawi had also talked about the problems in Somalia, where political anarchy has prevented the formation of a nationally elected government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe also discussed the crisis in Zaire with the United States assistant secretary of state, George Moose, on how the American government could help end bloodshed in central Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a separate interview, Zenawi said he was concerned about the &quot;unfolding situation in the Great Lakes region&quot; and called for renewed efforts to end the blood-letting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he declined to say what specific measures could be taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zenawi also called for increased trade between Zimbabwe and Ethiopia, saying this was necessary to complement the already existing &quot;excellent political relations&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the two leaders did not discuss the continued stay in Zimbabwe of deposed former Ethiopian strongman, Mengistu Haile Mariam, now on trial in absentia for genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not an issue and has never been an issue. It is a legal issue,&quot; Zenwai said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - Five people were injured on 15 October, one of them seriously, when a portion of a Blantyre hotel roof collapsed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the more than 30 people who escaped unhurt from the tragedy at Ryall's Hotel was Secretary General of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa) Bingu Mutharika. Mutharika was holding discussions with Malawian businessmen on how to conduct business in the Comesa region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hotel is now likely to close for renovations. A senior officer at the hotel who opted for anonymity said the hotel's structural engineers were now set to recommend temporary closure of the hotel where cracks had been visible in the walls for some time.The source said the hotel, the oldest hotel in Malawi built more than 55 years ago, was in bad shape and needed complete renovation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MCP PROTESTS ON FOREIGN LAWYERS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers for the Malawi Congress Party in the Press Trust appeal case on October 15 protested against the admission to the bar of two British lawyers hired by the Attorney General to represent him in the proceedings. The appeal case started on October 15 in the Supreme Court in Blantyre. The Attorney General wants the Supreme Court to reverse the High Court ruling which declared null and void the Press Trust Reconstruction Act because it was passed without the required quorum in the national assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foreign lawyers are Patrick Elias, QC and Andrew Dobson, solicitor. The case is being presided over by Mrs Justice Msosa, Justice Isaac Mtambo and Justice James Kalaile. Solicitor General Steve Matenje, who is leading the state counsel in the case argued that the foreign lawyers were already admitted to the bar by both the Chief Justice and the Law Society of Malawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Temwa Nyirenda counsel for the MCP, said section 98 of the Malawi constitution, under which the office of the Attorney General was established gives the Attorney General powers to engage only public servants who are his subordinates to represent him in constitutional matters in court. Nyirenda said the two lawyers were neither public servants nor subordinates of the Attorney General and were thus not eligible to represent him in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FAMILY FEUD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An irate Dutch woman married to a Malawian clergyman recently ordered her watch guard to shoot relatives of her husband who were involved in a family feud with her over property. In the shoot out, an expectant woman was shot dead while three men sustained gunshot wounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dutch woman, Anne Robinson, married to Pastor Lewis Chikhwaza of the Bible Faith Ministries of Blantyre sustained multiple injuries when a horde of angry villagers descended on her executing instant justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The feud is centred around a 50 acre piece of land belonging to Chikhwaza in Bvumbwe, on the outskirts of Blantyre. Robinson admitted she had ordered the guard, Laison Bandula to open fire at a group of villagers who were shouting at her over the feud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ONE KILLED IN INDIAN HEMP HAUL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police in Nkhota-kota, central Malawi, killed one person and arrested 13 others when they intercepted the biggest ever Indian hemp haul with a street value of K6 million (US$200,000 ).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police mounted a roadblock after receiving a tip-off. The 10,000 kilos of hemp was being transported from Nkhota-kota to the capital, Lilongwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the police, the dead man, identified as Davy Phiri, once served a jail sentence for dealing in hemp.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - Aford president Chakufwa Chihana has been criticised as being unrealistic and that his views cannot be taken seriously. This follows a statement he made recently proposing a government of national unity to resolve the current political squabbling.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chihana told a rally in his northern region stronghold that only a government of national involving all the main political parties, UDF, MCP and Aford would iron out the present political impasse in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MCP vice president Gwanda Chakuamba and UDF publicity secretary Cassim Chilumpha wondered how Chihana, who had failed to work in alliance with both the UDF and the MCP, would now manage to bring all the three parties together saying it was Chihana who ditched the MCP, with which his party formed an alliance soon after the general elections in 1994. Soon after he went into another marriage with the ruling UDF. Chilumpha and Chakuamba said they found Chihana's proposal &quot;very strange and not feasible&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an editorial, the daily Nation newspaper, which has never had good words for Chihana, described the Aford leader as a political prostitute. The Nation is owned by Mbumba Achutan, daughter of Finance Minister Aleke Banda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country is awash with stories that Chihana has been holding private talks with Chakuamba on the possibility of forming another alliance against the government. Both Aford and MCP walked out of parliament during the last session in protest against President Bakili Muluzi's appointment of Aford MPs into the cabinet without consulting their party.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - Former exile Kanyama Chiume has taken a swipe at the country's political leadership saying it needed changing because it is composed of &quot; reminiscences of dark days&quot; of the past regime. Chiume was one of the leaders of small parties which embraced with zeal and put their trust in the formation of the Common Electoral Group in the run-up to the general elections as the only way to dislodge the dictatorship of Kamuzu Banda.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the real direction of the present leadership depended on the &quot; fatness of the financial carrot dangled before individuals&quot;. He has offered to mediate in talks over the political impasse between Aford, MCP and UDF by convening a meeting at the end of this month involving concerned Malawians, diplomats, political and religious leaders and trade unionist to discuss the appointment of ministers from the opposition without consultation with their parties which he said diluted multi-party democracy and could plunge the country back into the vicious cycle of one party dictatorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiume said the situation is being aggravated by weaknesses in the constitution which gave room to the executive arm of government to deliberately flout constitutional conventions and ethics.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - Although accusations of rampant corruption in government have come from several quarters, it is only Aford President Chakufwa Chihana who has been probed by police, causing speculation that the move by police was politically motivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chihana was the first person in December last year to accuse the ruling UDF government, at that time in coalition with Aford, of corruption.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was then second vice president, a position he relinquished in May, this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August, the same charge was made by Rolf Patel, a former minister in the government. He made the allegation after he had been ditched as cabinet minister in a reshuffle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muluzi, defending his government, said there was no corruption and has hit back at his detractors saying anyone accusing government of corruption should provide evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Anti-Corruption Bureau said a few weeks ago that when need arose it would ask police to investigate allegations of corruption, so that when police went to probe Chihana on the charges, it was thought that they were acting on instructions from the bureau. But ACB director Gilton Chiwaula denied having sent police to probe Chihana saying that his organisation was not yet operational because, among other things, it did not have a secretariat.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - The Electoral Commission which has been accused of financial mismanagement has dismissed the accusations describing them as being &quot;full of malice&quot;. This followed an article recently carried in The Nation newspaper, alleging that K15 million (US$1 million) had been misused during the two years the commission has been operational.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission's Press Officer, Morgan Mayani, one of the few senior permanent employees at the secretariat and presently largely responsible for authorising expenditure, said a report by auditors which pointed out anomalies in the financial records of the commission had been discussed with the auditors who only demanded that in future the commission be strict with the way it controls expenditures by insisting on returns for expenses on such items as fuel.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayani said the commission strongly felt the report had a malicious motive.  &quot;People would like to undermine us in view of the Ndirande by-election,&quot; he said adding that some cabinet ministers, such as Lands and Valuation minister Peter Fachi, have clearly stated that the commission should be replaced because the UDF does not like the decisions it makes on certain issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Malawi's electoral body is seeking more powers from parliament to enable it to punish any political party involved in violence in the run-up to an election. Electoral Commission's chairperson, Anastazia Msosa, said the commission will soon lobby parliament to amend the Presidential and Parliamentary Election Act to empower it to suspend any political party that disrupts the electoral process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The need for more power for the commission comes in the wake of increasing incidents of violence during political campaigns by supporters of rival parties. Presently the commission cannot act on any incident of violence during campaigning until one of the aggrieved parties complains to the commission in writing. Even when the commission receives such a complaint, it has to rely on the police to investigate incidents and this can take too long.  This has caused a lot of dissatisfaction among the members of the political parties.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - Malawi has hit itself where it hurts most. It has banned the advertising of tobacco through the Malawi Broadcasting Corporation radio.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tobacco is Malawi's biggest foreign exchange earner accounting for 74% of export earnings, and employing thousands when the crop is in season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief of Health Services, Dr Wesley Sangala, said although the World Health Organisation spared Malawi the anti-smoking lobby's pressure against the growing of tobacco due to the crop's economic importance to the country, it was still required to ban advertising of tobacco products in the media, especially radio and other places like buses and billboards. Through a letter to the MBC, and BAT, the country's only cigarette manufacturer, the Health ministry instructed the radio station to immediately stop advertising tobacco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sangala said, however, Malawi was one of the few countries in the world that would not be pressured to stop tobacco growing until the country found alternative income sources. Tobacco Association of Malawi (Tama) president, Andrew Mzumacharo said he was shocked at the development describing it as &quot; total suicide on the part of the government&quot;. He said Malawi had been left out by the international community on the anti-tobacco smoking campaign and therefore found no reason for the government to ban tobacco advertisements saying the ban would affect the tobacco industry which has a big local market.</SPAN></P>

Anne Phiri of Premier Trading Company told the high court in Blantyre on the second day of hearing in the &quot; note book scam case&quot; that the tender board cancelled a tender she had been awarded to supply slates to the ministry of education.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Ms Phiri, Sam Mpasu, former minister of education lied when he told the court that the reason why government urgently purchased notebooks instead of unbreakable slates was that her company had failed to meet the tender requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another company, FieldYork International of UK, is also suing the Malawi government in connection with irregularities in the supply of free primary school exercise books and other materials. In the case Mpasu has sued The Democrat newspaper for defamation following an article the newspaper carried alleging that Mpasu received hefty kickbacks in return for awarding the notebook contract to FieldYork.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpasu, while admitting there were irregularities in procedures has denied there were any shady deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A letter dated September 15 1994 tendered in evidence, from the Central Tender Board informed Premier Trading of the board's approval of the latter's quotation for the supply of 1.2 million unbreakable slates and 2.5 million pencils. A few days later the contract was cancelled saying it had been an error.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Following is the text of a statement by the U.S. Agency for International Development on October 30 outlining U.S. efforts and concerns regarding the humanitarian crisis in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States is deeply concerned by the deteriorating humanitarian crisis taking place in Eastern Zaire. The worsening security situation has forced most of the international relief workers to evacuate the area, severely restricting access to the vulnerable populations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States is working closely with the United Nations and the international relief community to provide assistance where possible. A humanitarian assessment team from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) was dispatched to the region late last week to coordinate and facilitate U.S. response to the unfolding crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States is currently funding UNHCR, the U.N. World Food Program (WFP) and several non-governmental organizations in the region. The WFP has stated that there is an adequate supply of food in the region for the short term. USAID is prepared to provide additional resources as appropriate.  However, the problem is not one of access.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States joins with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Madame Ogata in appealing to the Rwandan refugees to consider voluntary repatriation back to Rwanda at this time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international relief community is prepositioning food and other relief supplies throughout the region in order to respond flexibly to the rapidly changing situation on the ground. Refugee repatriation reception centers have been set up in Rwanda at Gisenyi and Cyangugu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The critical problem facing more than 500,000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees and displaced Zairians in the Uvira and Bukavu corridor is their lack of access to food and water. Access and movement has been restricted in the Goma region due to insecure conditions. Relief agencies have also reduced numbers of staff in light of recent attacks on camps in that region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States has called upon all parties to cease the violence and defuse the situation. The governments in the region are urged by the international relief community to provide corridors of tranquility to allow for the movement of emergency humanitarian supplies for refugee and displaced populations located in areas currently inaccessible to the relief workers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Remarks by Nicholas Burns, the department spokesman, at the daily briefing on October 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: The Secretary General this morning appointed a Special Envoy to the Great Lakes region. He is the current Canadian Ambassador to the United States, Raymond Chretien.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First of all, if I might ask, does he enjoy the confidence of the United States? And does that Office of Special Envoy enjoy the confidence and support of the United States?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: The United States is very pleased that the Secretary General of the UN has appointed Ambassador Chretien -- Ambassador Raymond Chretien -- to this post as UN Special Envoy for the Great Lakes region. We know him very well. He's the Canadian Ambassador to the United States. He has the highest respect of everybody in this government -- from Secretary Christopher to Under Secretary Tarnoff, everyone who has been working with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I understand that Under Secretary Tarnoff and others in this building -- our African specialists -- will be consulting with him personally in the next couple of days before he leaves on his month-long trip to Central Africa. He has our respect, he has our best wishes, and he will have our support in every way -- political and otherwise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think there's a coincidence of views here between the United States and Canada. I think both of us feel that there has to be a greater effort made by the governments in the region to stop the fighting. Both of us support the efforts of Mrs. Ogata, the UN High Commissioner on Refugees, to deal with this nearly disastrous humanitarian situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I know that Assistant Secretary of State Phyllis Oakley and other American officials are going to be up in New York talking to Mrs. Ogata about that refugee situation. We'll stay in close touch with the UNHCR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: As a follow-up to that, of course, appreciating that Canada and the United States and other nations are in tune on this, it is, however, a United Nations office. A couple of requests on the part of the Secretary General of this Special Envoy, and I read them to you: &quot;To give advice on the size and structure of the United Nations political presence which will be established in the Great Lakes region,&quot; does that give this Administration difficulty?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, secondly, the attempts to establish a cease-fire, does the Special Envoy have unilateral action and your support to do both of those things? Or are there concerns that you would express here today about those?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: I wouldn't express any concerns. I think he's got a very difficult mandate and a very difficult mission ahead. He has our full support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We would like to see a cease-fire in eastern Zaire, along the Rwandan border -- in Bukuvu, in Goma, and other places. We'd very much like to see a cease-fire, because it's been the fighting that has produced, motivated we think, over 500,000 people to leave the refugee camps and to flee in different directions. Now those people are in danger of not having adequate food and medical and water supplies to keep them going, to keep them alive over the next couple of weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is a real humanitarian crisis that we've got here. So all of our support goes to Ambassador Chretien. He will need, obviously, to figure out -- he will need to address these questions as he goes along in his mission. We will keep in contact with him and the UN as he does.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: But given some of the difficulties that exist between the United States and the United Nations, this question of an establishment of a UN political presence in the region, isn't that difficult, to say the least? And aren't you concerned and won't you be watching that particular part of his mission?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: We will have to see what recommendations are made by Ambassador Chretien to the UN Secretary General. We don't want to anticipate what his conclusions might be. We ought to give him some latitude in order to give him some time to figure out what he thinks the best solution is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we have said, Henry, is that the idea of some kind of regional conference to bring the warring factions together is a good one as long as the regional governments are represented and as long as the people coming to the conference are serious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for any kind of permanent political presence, we'll have to see what that means. But we don't start off, in looking at Ambassador Chretien's mission, with five reasons why he's not going to succeed. He's a very able, experienced diplomat. He's got the confidence of the Canadian Government as well as our government. There's every reason to think that he's the man for this job. We ought to let him go out there and see what he wants to recommend and then we'll react to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Will the U.S. contribute to an international presence in the Great Lakes region?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: We'll have to see what that means. I don't think that there's any serious planning underway for any U.S. military presence, if you're asking. There's no planning for that right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A political presence to us would mean something quite different. Perhaps we're talking about an augmented group that would be available to arrange and coordinate the humanitarian assistance. We'll just have to see what is in mind, but we don't start off with the presumption that American troops will go to Central Africa. I don't believe that's in the cards right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's one more question. Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Norway, yesterday -- the Foreign Minister of Norway has asked the United Nations Security Council to intervene militarily in eastern Zaire.  Does the U.S. support that -- not necessarily U.S. troops, but if other people can do it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. BURNS: We'll have to see what Ambassador Chretien recommends to Secretary General Boutros Ghali. We don't want to get ahead of those recommendations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have said in the past, and Secretary Christopher said throughout his Africa tour, that the idea of some kind of crisis response force, manned by the African countries makes sense. It's not going to be possible to have that force ready to be of assistance in the current crisis in the Great Lakes region. This crisis points to the need, again, for an African Crisis Response Force -- a force that African countries would control; that African countries would contribute to; and that they could use along with others in the international community such as the United Nations for situations like this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether or not Ambassador Chretien recommends X, Y, or Z, we'll just have to wait and see. We ought to give him some liberty and some room to take a look at the situation and then we'll respond.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Fighting in and around Goma, the capital of North Kivu, intensified during the morning, having started around 3 am local time. Aid agencies reported escalating artillery shelling throughout Thursday morning and Zairean soldiers and Tutsi-dominated rebels battled for control of Goma airport. Aid workers and local people kept off the street as insecurity increased. Aid agencies have had some 35 cars looted during the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The airport is one of the most strategic assets in the Kivu region, and its security will be crucial for delivering humanitarian aid. Although some reports said Zairean authorities had lost control of the airport earlier in the day, by late afternoon it appeared to be under Zairean military control.  AFP reported Zairean troops on the runways and around the airport's perimeter.  WFP had hoped to use the airport today to begin an emergency airlift of food supplies but the effort has been postponed. It appears that the airport is unlikely to be accessible even for an evacuation of foreign workers in the immediate future.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Goma airport closed, and relief activities almost completely halted due to insecurity, UN officials are considering an evacuation by road of 107 international humanitarian aid staff trapped in the city. Of this number, 42 are UN staff and the rest work with NGOs. The UN is seeking safe passage and escort to the border from Zairean authorities and also is pursuing other options for a rapid exit. The Rwandan side of the border is open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Wednesday appealed to Zairean President Mobutu and Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo to allow the staff members to leave. International staff are generally confined to their offices and houses. Zairean soldiers raided the UNICEF compound several times, looted and drove away three utility vehicles and a truck. ICRC also report looting of their offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the north, aid workers said that all 113,000 residents of Kahindo camp north of Goma fled the camp, starting in the middle of the night. Many of Kahindo's residents appear to be headed for Muganga camp. Mugunga camp is already one of the world's largest refugee camps with over 350,000 residents.  But UNHCR officials now say the camp is dangerously overcrowded with limited water and sanitation facilities. The BBC quoted a UNHCR spokesman saying inhabitants of the camp faced an &quot;apocalyptic&quot; future. Camp residents have reportedly already taken to drinking lake water and health officals fear cholera and dysentery epidemics may soon hit the camp. Mugunga camp was already trying to accomodate 195,000 new arrivals from Kibumba who arrived during the last few days. There is also a severe shortage of wood with which to build shelters or cook food. The potential conglomeration of over half a million people without clean water or sanitation - let alone food and medical care - is a recipe for disaster. Local Zairean people continue to take refuge in Mugunga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last remaining camp on the northern axis, Katale, has a population of 202,000, but its position is precarious, as it is hemmed in by fighting to the north and south. Further north, the number of recently-arrived refugees in southwestern Uganda is estimated to be 7,000. Despite the worsening situation, only a trickle of Rwandan refugees are choosing to return home, where aid agencies and the Rwandan government are prepared for a major influx.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Kivu, Roman Catholic Archbishop Munzihirwa was killed during an ambush in Bukavu on Tuesday. He had been an outspoken critic of the rebellion.  His body was found on 30 October. Two European priests are also being held captive by rebels. The Banyamulenge-domainted forces have yet to exert complete control over Bukavu, according to accounts of some of the 424 refugees reported to have arrived in southwestern Rwanda. The rebels now claim to comprise four political groups, including parties from Shaba and Kasai, gathered under a multi-ethnic umbrella party called the Alliance des Forces Democratiques pour la Liberation du Congo-Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR reported earlier today that some of their local staff may have been killed and injured during an attempt to flee from Bukavu. No further details are available. Local Zairean relief workers have played a key role in maintaining life-saving services and communication links after the evacuation of international staff in many parts of eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports indicate that bodies are washing up on the Burundian side of Lake Tankanyika, probably having been dumped in the Rusizi river, which marks much of the border between Burundi and Zaire. The number of victims and their identities have not been established, but a Reuter report mentions sighting 13 bodies and hearing of 50 more buried by local fishermen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 5,500 Burundians have so far returned home and are at the Gatumba camp near Bujmubura. Two thousand of these arrived today. UNHCR and Burundian authorities are planning to start a relocation back to home communes beginning Monday. Thousands more returnees are expected over the coming days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International journalists have entered rebel-held South Kivu from Rwanda today for the first time, and report relative stability on the road north of Uvira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diplomatic efforts continue to attempt to forestall a worsening of the crisis. UN Special Mediator, Raymond Chretien, should arrive in Kinshasa next week, and the OAU's Conflict Resolution Organ today issued a statement in Addis Ababa appealing for a cessation of hostilities and urging respect for the territorial integrity of Rwanda and Zaire. Zaire's Prime Minister, Kengo wa Dondo today said Zaire would not negotiate while &quot;the enemy&quot; holds part of Zairean territory. President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya announced plans to convene a regional summit on Zaire next Tuesday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - At a time when Rwandese refugees are under attack in Eastern Zaire, the plight of other victims continues to be ignored by the international community, Amnesty International said today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More attention should be paid to the scale of human rights abuses that have given rise and continue to fuel the crisis in Eastern Zaire. Violations in Zaire affect not only refugees -- they also affect civilians who are Zairian nationals, and local and foreign humanitarian workers,&quot; the human rights organization said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United Nations (UN) and others have been appealing to Rwandese refugees to return home and have behaved as if several hundred Burundi refugees and displaced Zairians do not also deserve protection. The fact that the refugees fear human rights violations if they return to Rwanda and Burundi is being ignored, as are the abuses they and unarmed civilians in Zaire face.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International is disturbed by reports that attacks on unarmed civilians have, in addition to causing loss of hundreds of lives since September 1996, forced humanitarian workers to abandon refugees to their uncertain fate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Attacks by Zairian government troops and members of the Banyamulenge Tutsi armed group deserve no less than the condemnation of the whole world,&quot; Amnesty International said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International is calling on the Tutsi armed group leaders immediately to instruct their fighters not to attack any civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World governments and inter-governmental organizations should seek guarantees that the parties to the conflict will respect human rights and the impartiality of humanitarian workers. Amnesty International is calling on the international community to ensure the provision of adequate humanitarian assistance for refugees and internally displaced civilians as a matter of urgency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of unarmed civilians were reportedly arbitrarily and deliberately killed in recent weeks during fighting between Zairian government troops and the Tutsi-led armed group in South-Kivu region. Hundreds of thousands of Rwandese and Burundi refugees are fleeing from camps in the region. Fighting has resumed in North-Kivu region where more than 10,000 people have been killed by armed groups and government forces, and hundreds of thousands displaced during the past three years. Nearly 20,000 Zairian people have fled to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International is appealing to the Zairian Government to end the long-standing impunity of members of its armed forces and local government officials who are responsible for human rights violations against unarmed civilians, local non-governmental organisations and members of various ethnic groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International fears that members of the Zairian armed forces are likely to carry out further attacks on civilians, judging from their past record of involvement in human rights violations, their lack of discipline and the fact that many are not even paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government should make it clear to its forces and officials that human rights abuses, including disturbing reports of deportations of Zairian and Tutsi refugees, will not be tolerated,&quot; Amnesty International said. &quot; Officials known to have ordered or incited human rights abuses should immediately be brought to justice -- only then will the cycle of impunity end.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, there should be an international condemnation of those who, like the former deputy governor of South-Kivu, have made public statements that incite ethnic hatred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization is also calling on all armed opposition groups to honour their obligations under international humanitarian law not to harm civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incitements to racial or national hatred violate Zaire&quot;s legally binding obligations under human rights treaties it has ratified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reports that Rwandese government officials have said that they will not allow Zairian Tutsi men to seek refuge in Rwanda, but that the men should rather stay in Zaire to fight, are likely to encourage further killings and other human rights abuses in Zaire,&quot; Amnesty International said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International believes that this is a violation of regional and international conventions for the protection of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Rwandese authorities should resist from making statements likely to exacerbate tensions,&quot; Amnesty International said. &quot;Statements suggesting that the Rwandese Government will only accept the refugees if the Zairian Government also gives them the Zairian territories they occupied, are likely to exacerbate the tensions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization released a report today that documents gross human rights violations by government forces that have been a persistent feature of both North and South-Kivu.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in the KwaZulu/Natal-Free State region will hold simultaneous hearings in Durban and Empangeni next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A four-person TRC panel which will be headed by regional commissioner, the Rev Dr Khoza Mgojo, will listen to more than 30 cases of gross human rights violations at the Empangeni Town Hall over three days, from Monday November 4 to Wednesday November 6.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the cases that the TRC will listen to will focus largely on the conflict which has raged on virtually unabated for years, between the ANC and IFP supporters in the Empangeni and surrounding areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will also be two cases of massacres that will come before the commission, including the gruesome slaughter of a family during the attack at the home of a popular trade unionist, Howick Modicai Ngubeni, a University of Zululand employee, whose home was attacked in August 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ngoye massacre in the eighties is also likely to feature during these rounds of hearings. So will be the murder of Dr Henry Vika Luthuli who was gunned down in his surgery at Esikhawini on 2nd August 1990. His widow, Dorcas Nokuzola Luthuli, will appeal to the TRC to help in tracing the killers of her husband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Persistent and brutal attacks on unionised workers, especially those employed at the Richards Bay Minerals will also come under the spotlight over the three days that the commission will spend at Empangeni.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The murder of civil rights lawyer, Griffiths Mxenge, whose gruesome murder in Durban years ago sent shockwaves throughout the country and abroad, will once again come alive at the Durban Christian Centre from Tuesday November 5 to Friday November 8 when the Amnesty Committee of the TRC hears applications for amnesty from three people who allegedly killed him, former Vlakplaas commander, Dirk Coetzee and his two sidekicks, Almond Nofomela and David Tshikalanga, both who were turned ANC operatives, known as &quot;Askaris&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mxenge was abducted near his home in Umlazi and his body later found in the nearby soccer stadium, with more than 40 stab wounds and his eyes gauged out. Although this story has been told before, it will be the first time that his killers will openly admit to the crime and give finer detail of their deed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from the Mxenge killing, the amnesty committee will for the first hear how Coetzee and his henchmen killed an Eastern Cape political activist, Sizwe Kondile who was also brutally murdered in November 1981.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his application for amnesty from the TRC, Dirk Coetzee has mentioned 7 murders he committed in various parts of the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Statement by Dr Alex Boraine, deputy chairperson of the Truth And Reconciliation Commission, October 30, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sentencing of Col Eugene de Kock to two life sentences comes as no surprise to anyone if one bears in mind the charges made against him, including six murders.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For those who were involved in similar incidences of gross human rights violations, this should come as a very tough warning that there are only two real alternatives facing them. If the offenses had a political context, then they can either face charges in a court of law, or they can approach the Amnesty Committee of the TRC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, none of them should hesitate, because the deadline for amnesty applications is 14 December this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission has already heard from Col. De Kock's attorneys and no doubt he will be making an application for amnesty in due course. It should be pointed out that there are charges on which Col. De Kock was convicted, which falls outside of the terms of reference of the Commission.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - Following is a statement issued by the Steering Committee for Humanitarian Response, a coalition of seven of the largest International Non- Governmental Organisations which respond to humanitarian disasters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The members include: Care International, Caritas Internationalis, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the International Save the Children Alliance, The Lutheran World Federation, Oxfam and the World Council of Churches. All of these organizations or their partners are providing humanitarian assistance during the present crisis in the Great Lakes region of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEGIN TEXT:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again the Great Lakes region of Africa is on the brink of a major humanitarian disaster. The present violence and ensuing population movements have further intensified an already grave situation, stretching the capacity of humanitarian organizations to meet human needs. Humanitarian efforts are also hampered by the lack of accurate information on refugee movements and by extremely limited access.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SCHR members are making preparations for different possible outcomes. For example,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Oxfam staff have contingency stocks of water equipment and plans in place ready to respond as the situation develops. In response to the movement of refugees in North Kivu, Oxfam doubled its water supply capacity in Muganga to help provide clean water and sanitation for the 200,000 refugees fleeing from Kibumba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies supervised food distributions to these same refugees, and other Red Cross volunteers conducted distributions in Katale and Kahindo prior to the evacuation of those camps. The Federation is preparing transit facilities for Burundian returnees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Save the Children is preparing for the registration of increased numbers of unaccompanied refugee children returning to Rwanda and Burundi and will respond to the situation in Zaire in the areas of health, family reunification and the provision of non food items when the situation stabilises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Catholic Relief Services is supporting efforts of Caritas Goma to alleviate suffering of people in Eastern Zaire through the distribution of food and non food items.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">*ACT/LWF is pre-positioning food and non food items in Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania, is preparing an assessment mission to the west of Bukavu, and has a stand-by team in Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* CARE International has contingency stocks of food and non food distribution equipment and contingency plans in place to respond in North and South Kivu, Burundi and Rwanda. CARE is providing transportation and logisitics for food distribution in Magunga camp and CARE's Zairian and refugee staff are providing health care and supervision of distributions in Katale camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, at the moment, much of the relief community's essential humanitarian response is disrupted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current crisis is the most serious regional conflict since the Rwanda genocide in 1994. Tensions between Zaire and Rwanda are escalating. Zaire has accused Rwanda of supporting the Banyamulenge with manpower and heavy weapons, while Rwanda has accused Zaire of instigating the conflict. The crisis is a symptom of a deeper instability in the region which must be tackled if the people of Central Africa are to prosper and know security again. It is possible that this crisis could escalate into full scale war within Zaire or between Rwanda and Zaire, leading to regional conflagration which spreads to other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To prevent the situation from deteriorating further, the members of the Steering Committee for Humanitarian Response urge regional factions, regional governments and the international community to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Accelerate efforts to address the underlying causes of the conflict in the region through a regional political settlement The current crisis in Zaire is symptomatic of a wider regional crisis that has been simmering for years. It is part of the failure of regional governments, various factions and the international community to address the political, social and economic problems that underlie the region's tensions. The region will continue to lurch from crisis to crisis until a coordinated negotiations process addresses the two key aspects of the region's conflicts: the aftermath of genocide and poverty. Tackling these issues will include reforming the justice system, addressing citizenship and refugee return, generating economic rehabilitation, and establishing responsive and accountable government. The UN Security Council with the OAU should intensify efforts towards coordinated negotiations to reach a regional political settlement.  Humanitarian aid saves lives, but can never substitute for the political will to reach solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Intensify high-level diplomatic action to reduce tensions, bring about a political settlement and guarantee humanitarian access. The UN Security Council and other governments should immediately agree a strategy to increase diplomatic pressure to secure the protection of displaced peoples and refugees, ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance, and initiate immediate negotiations between Zaire and Rwanda. Ambassador Chretien should be given as much support as possible for his work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Develop adequate contingency plans for a humanitarian response in the event of a widening war. Preparation should be intensified by DHA and the UN agencies to agree a contingency plan in the event of the further deterioration of the situation. Local, regional and international non- governmental organizations should be involved in these consultations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Signed, CARE International, Catholic Relief Services (member of Caritas Internationalis), Oxfam, The Lutheran World Federation, Save the Children, World Council of Churches.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - By mid-afternoon, there were reports of large-scale cross border shelling between Rwanda and Zaire at the border close to Gisenyi and Goma.  Rwandan senior advisor Claude Dusaidi said that sixteen mortars fell on Gisenyi, including hits on the site of the former Petite Barriere Zairean Tutsi refugee camp, which had previously been evacuated. &quot;We are being aggressed&quot;, he said in a BBC interview. Some reports say Rwandan forces were seen firing towards the Goma area from boats on Lake Kivu. Rwandan authorities allege that ex-Rwandan Government Forces and Interahamwe are getting involved in the fighting on the Zairean side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goma remained tense. Although aid agencies reported only limited fighting around the city during Thursday night, looting continued and armed youths were reported roaming the streets of some sections of the city. Both IFRC and UNICEF reported that armed individuals confiscated a large number of their vehicles. As efforts continued to evacaute a portion of the international humanitarian staff in the city, aid agencies took advantage of the lull in fighting Friday morning to congregate their staff at the UNHCR compound and other designated evacuation points. However, this operation was interrupted when fighting was again heard in the city late morning. It is still undecided when or how an evacuation will take place, if all international humanitarian staff would be evacuated, or if a skeleton humanitarian staff will remain behind.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early in the day, there were reports that all 210,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees in the Katale camp north of Goma were fleeing Friday, caught in cross fire between Tutsi rebels and Zairean troops. The refugees were said to be moving southwest, possibly towards Muganga camp. However, late Friday afternoon, a UNHCR spokesman said the reports were incorrect and that the refugees were just moving into the interior of the camp. Katale is the northernmost camp and is 54km from Goma. The location of another 113,000 refugees who fled Kahindo camp yesterday is still unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first international press reports from rebel-held South Kivu since the crisis began, Reuter reports from Uvira that thousands of heavily-armed Banyamulenge fighters were visible on the road from the town of Kamanyola, near Bukavu, to the town of Uvira, about 100 km south. The dispatch said that inhabitants of the town were returning on foot to their homes which were largely intact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech delivered in Uvira, Laurent Kabila, chief coordinator of the newly formed Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire, told a crowd of thousands of cheering people that &quot;we must move Mobutu and throw him into the dustbin of history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The BBC reported that up to 100 foreigners, mostly European missionaries, were trapped by fighting in the Roman Catholic cathedral in Bukavu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Burundi, another 2,000 Burundians have returned from Zaire to the Gatumba camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three leading Zairean human rights activists have been detained for making inquiries into the plight of Tutsis detained by military authorities. A statement from The Voice of the Voiceless Organization said that their president and two other members of the organization were being denied both food and the right to receive visitors. According to Amnesty International, hundreds of unarmed civilians were arbitrarily and deliberately killed in fighting in South Kivu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette on Thursday accused Rwanda of intervening militarily in eastern Zaire. The accusations were made in a foreign policy debate in the French Senate. There are persistant rumours that France intends to intervene in the eastern Zaire but the French government has denied any such plans. French Defence Minister Charles Millon that &quot; France wants a clear reaction on the part of the United Nations&quot;, but that France did not want to be put in the &quot;same position&quot; as two years ago, when its Operation Turquoise in southwestern Rwanda was widely criticized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MSF on Thursday called for the creation of a protected zone for refugees caught up in the fighting in eastern Zaire. MSF urged that a protected area be set up in Rwanda &quot;at a reasonable distance from the conflict zone&quot;, through which refugees could pass and humanitarian agencies could safely operate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International calls for a ceasefire continue. In a speech to UN delegates, Raymond Chretien, who was named UN Special Mediator on Wednesday, said his first priority would be to attempt to arrange a ceasefire. He is expected to arrive in the region on November 8. South African President Nelson Mandela said he too was ready to play a role in the region but did not specify what form this might take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Steering Committee for Humanitarian Response, a coalition of seven of the largest international NGOs has also released a statement calling on the international community to intensify diplomatic efforts to bring about a political settlement as well as to develop adequate contingency plans for a humanitarian response in the event of a widening war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire's Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo said his country would refuse to negotiate over the fighting and refugee crisis while the &quot;enemy&quot; holds Zairean territory. On Thursday, the Zairean Transitional National Assembly called for the severing of Zaire's relations with Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda and the called upon the goverment to halt debt service payments to the IMF to pay for the military effort in the east. Tutsis in Kinshasa allege increasing harassment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dutch government announced that it would provide WFP with $3.5 million to help the agency in its efforts to address the crisis in eastern Zaire. The bulk of the cash will go towards the transport and distribution of food in the region but money will also be set aside for the reconstruction - as soon there is sufficient security - of port facilities needed for the off-loading of aid in Bukavu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radio Rwanda reported that Bangilima fighters, a North Kivu militia group, stormed a church early Wednesday morning and released some 500 mainly Tutsi prisoners who had been held for several days. The raid enabled the &quot;hostages&quot; to cross the border into Gisenyi. The report did not specify who had been holding the people prisoners.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington, DC - Once again the Great Lakes region of Africa is on the brink of a major humanitarian disaster.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humanitarian efforts are also hampered by the lack of accurate information on refugee movements and by very limited access.

The region will continue to lurch from crisis to crisis until a coordinated negotiations process addresses the two key aspects of the region's conflicts: the aftermath of genocide and poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tackling these issues will include reforming the justice system, addressing citizenship and refugee return, generating economic rehabilitation, and establishing responsive and accountable government. The UN Security Council with the OAU should intensify efforts towards coordinated negotiations to reach a regional political settlement. Humanitarian aid saves lives, but can never substitute for the political will to reach solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Intensify high-level diplomatic action to reduce tensions and guarantee humanitarian access. The UN Security Council and other governments should immediately agree a strategy to increase diplomatic pressure to secure the protection of displaced peoples and refugees, ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance, and initiate immediate negotiations between Zaire and Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Develop adequate contingency plans for a humanitarian response in the event of a widening war. Preparation should be intensified by DHA and the UN agencies to agree a contingency plan in the event of the further deterioration of the situation. Local, regional and international non- governmental organizations should be involved in these consultations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specifically we ask you to write, phone or fax Madeleine Albright at the UN and ask that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediate action by the UN Security Council, EU and others to redouble their efforts to work for:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- a regional political settlement that addresses the underlying problems</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- coordinated international diplomatic action to try and reduce tensions in the region between various governments and within Zaire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- diplomatic action to guarantee humanitarian access</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- action to develop a coordinated UN response to the deteriorating humanitarian crises, including contingency planning.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - There can surely be no more glaring example of the bully-boy nature of South African rugby administration than the defeat of Brian van Rooyen in his bid to oust Louis Luyt as president of the Transvaal Rugby Football Union (TRFU).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For what Luyt managed to do was turn the issue from one of what Van Rooyen believed was best for the game into a personal attack on a man who had the guts to stand up and be counted. What Van Rooyen missed was one simple fact: the flags fluttering over the Ellis Park stadium may have changed, the old order has not.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Rooyen, in his failed bid, mirrored many of the things this newly hatched democracy is still striving for: transparency, accountability and a system of open and collective decision-making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accountant who still turns out at lock forward for his club voiced his concerns on the way the TRFU books are managed, about the inner circle who wield the power and about the lack of momentum in a programme to develop the game in underprivileged areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bid for presidency represented a microcosm of the problems facing the nation as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In victory, Luyt gloated. &quot;You are gone,&quot; he told his erstwhile opponent.  But then Luyt has ever been thus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was Luyt's own decision to play Die Stem over the Ellis Park public address system in defiance of any internal changes that had been made before the test against the All Blacks which signalled this country's re- admission to world rugby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was Luyt who uttered a smug and hugely unfunny slight of the All Blacks after the World Cup final and, when that all-time great of the game, Colin Meads, walked out, had the temerity to call the legendary New Zealander a &quot; has been&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was Luyt too who pushed for the installation of his son-in-law Riaan Oberholzer as the chief executive of first Sanzar and then the South African Rugby Union and made his son a capo of the Ellis Park Stadium mafia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There can also be little doubt that it was Luyt's hand that wielded the rubber stamp for the execution orders on Edward Griffiths, Morne de Plessis and Francois Pienaar, despite any public utterances to the contrary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pienaar was a marked man from the time he bested Luyt in the post-World Cup contractual wrangles. Luyt got him in the end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Rooyen has been headed off by a voting system that is loaded against any real semblance of democracy. Whether he is, as Luyt says &quot;gone&quot;, remains to be seen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Theodenne Kalenda waited uncertainly one side of an invisible line that marks the border between Zaire and Rwanda, halfway across a bridge over the Ruzizi river.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His neighbours watched from the hillside behind him. Some were no doubt pleased with their success in driving the village cobbler from his home. But there must have been many who wished they could have gone with him. Behind Kalenda was Bukavu, a city that has given way to looting and anarchy as Tutsi rebels bear down on it. Over the weekend, there was fresh mortaring by the Banyamulenge, Zairean Tutsis who have rebelled against a campaign of ethnic cleansing with remarkable success.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations has evacuated all aid workers from the city as the prospect of a battle loomed, abandoning hundreds of thousands of Rwandan and Burundian Hutu refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, said: &quot;A catastrophe greater than the one we knew in 1994 is what worries me most. I appeal to the combatants: please spare the refugees and local populations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalenda and his wife are more recent arrivals than the Banyamulenge, who can trace their roots in eastern Zaire back several centuries. Kalenda, aged 48, fled Rwanda in 1960. But, after 36 years living at peace with his neighbours, he was treated no differently from the Banyamulenge or any other Tutsis in Zaire when the persecution began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People came to our house and told us to go away. They called me a rebel.  We were threatened by soldiers who looted everything from our house, and said: 'You'd better leave or we'll kill you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalenda's house looked down on the bridge across the border, but he feared he might not make even that short distance. &quot;Some neighbours were kind to me and accompanied me to the border,&quot; Kalenda said. &quot;We were frightened of the military so we paid them $40 not to menace us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Kalenda fled, Bukavu radio was broadcasting a declaration by the provincial governor, Kyembwa wa Lumuna: &quot;Do not join the panic created by the Rwandan Tutsis under the pretext of recovering the land of their ancestors.  The murderers want to kill us. We are asking you to be vigilant, to find these people who have infiltrated among the refugees,&quot; it said every 15 minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It sounded remarkably similar to the extremist Hutu messages broadcast during the Rwandan genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Bukavu, many Tutsis have disappeared. Militiamen armed with nail-studded clubs patrol the streets. It is not clear if they are Zairean, or drawn from Hutu extremists among the Rwandan refugees. Tutsis have met a similar fate in Goma to the north, where rebels are moving towards refugee camps. The largest, Kibumba, emptied after fighting nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's tragic, appalling. We have a human river 25km long from the camp south to Goma,&quot; said Panos Moumtzis, spokesman for the UN refugee agency. On Sunday several thousand Hutu refugees even returned to Rwanda - a sign of desperation as they have resisted returning for two years fearing retribution for the genocide of Tutsis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire continues to accuse Rwanda of organising and arming the Banyamulenge, or even invading, but the Rwandan president, Pasteur Bizimugu, denied on Monday that his country was providing military help to the Banyamulenge, though he said he morally supported their struggle against &quot;extermination&quot; by Zairean authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers strongly suspect the Rwandan military of assisting the Zairean Tutsi militias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spreading conflict threatens the whole of Central Africa's Great Lakes region and the unity of Zaire. Zaire, the UN and Western governments, which appear powerless to intervene, are reaping the whirlwind of their callous indifference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1994, Zaire's now ailing president, Mobutu Sese Seko, gave a home to more than a million Rwandan Hutu refugees as a lever to destabilise the new Tutsi-dominated government in Rwanda. Sheltering the refugees won him favour among former friends, such as France and the United States, which quietly dropped pressure for Mobutu to surrender power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through the UN, the West fed and watered the hordes in the camps, and the world assuaged its guilt at ignoring the Hutu-inspired slaughter by pouring in massive aid. But this helped to ensure the survival of the Interahamwe militias, which had led the killing of Tutsis. The UN turned a blind eye not only to the past crimes of these mass killers, but their efforts to perpetuate the slaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu now lies sick in a Swiss hospital, and doubts whether he will survive his prostate cancer are increasing the chaos in his rudderless nation.  Meanwhile the UN is pleading for an end to the suffering of Hutu refugees, after standing by as those same refugees slaughtered thousands of Zairean Tutsis and set the present crisis in motion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muller Ruhimbika, a Banyamulenge, is scathing. &quot;For two years we've been telling people - diplomats and foreigners - it was going to explode. They were laughing in our faces when we asked for help. Now they want to mediate.  Mediate what?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The roots of the Banyamulenge rebellion lie not just in the fate of Tutsis during the Rwandan genocide, but also the mass slaughter of other Tutsis in Zaire over the past two years. Several hundred miles to the north of the Uvira area, the Banyarwanda were an early target for pogroms. Two years of attacks by Hutu militias drove 150 000 Banyarwanda from their homes; 15 000 people were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda warned of another genocide in the making and appealed for international intervention, but the UN in the refugee camps looked the other way, on the grounds that the Banyarwanda were Zairean citizens - even though one reason they were being murdered was because Zaire said it had stripped them of their citizenship. Only now is the UN facing up to what occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a report on the killings in Masisi, issued last month, it accused the Interahamwe of conniving with Zairean troops to murder and expel Tutsis and blames the Zairean government, especially the &quot;political class which has fomented xenophobic nationalist sentiment&quot;. Even some Zairean human rights groups are said to have &quot;fostered racial hatred and ethnic cleansing rather than defending the oppressed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the Banyamulenge, the crunch came when South Kivu's deputy governor, Lwasi Ngabo Lwabanji, gave them a week to get out of Zaire. Only too aware of the fate of the Banyarwanda in Masisi, they struck back last month. There is a clear attempt to empty the refugee camps, which suits both Rwanda and Burundi. Some believe Rwanda may be attempting to carve out a buffer zone.  But there's also no doubt that for many of the fighters the battle is about something closer to home - their own land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A BBC journalist, Martin Dawes, was beaten and robbed at gunpoint by soldiers from the Zairean army in Bukavu at the weekend.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Home Affairs Department has quietly dropped the fee charged to foreigners to marry South African citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July this year, Home Affairs introduced regulations which made it obligatory for foreigners to pay a set charge of almost R7 000 should they wish to marry South African citizens. At the time, the department appeared impervious to cries of outrage from South Africans with foreign-born spouses.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the affected South Africans phoned the Mail &amp; Guardian this week to say he had been told by officials the charge had been dropped from October 18.  Home Affairs has made no formal announcement to that effect. It is not known whether those who paid the amount between July and October will be reimbursed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home Affairs is also failing to communicate adequately about the appointment of new Immigration Selection Boards (ISBs). The department is having to re-open nominations for provincial ISBs in four provinces after only two nominations each from the Eastern Cape, the Northern Cape and North West were received and only four nominations from the Free State by the deadline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ISBs will decide which foreigners should be awarded permanent residence in this country. The current ISB, which was appointed by the Minister of Home Affairs before 1994 without consultation, is steeped in controversy after its ruling on British-born David Foulds was dismissed in the Rand Supreme Court earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ISB rejected Foulds's application for permanent residence, despite the fact that he runs a lucrative business which employs South Africans and has a turnover of almost R4- million. Instead of re-evaluating Foulds's application as the court instructed, the board had indicated that it would appeal against the judgement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of Home Affairs Mangosuthu Buthelezi said the fee charged for foreign wives had been dropped because it was &quot;unfair and unconstitutional&quot;.  This also means no fee will in future be levied for dependent children or aged or infirm members of the family.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The truth commission's Alex Boraine said the confessions would start. Last week, the perpetrators began to tell their stories. In the latest in our guest writer series, poet Antjie Krog listens to the different voices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For six months the Truth Commission has listened to the voices of victims.  The first narrative, focused and clear, cut into the country. It cut through class, language, persuasion - penetrating even the most frigid earhole of stone. And it continues. Somewhere, in some dusty, suburban hall this week, the tale keeps on being plaited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because she is sitting behind a microphone, dressed in beret or kopdoek and her Sunday best, authenticity and integrity are sustained. Everybody recognises her. But when her face distorts behind her rough hand, we know nobody knows her. So we have never known it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet something was amiss. We pricked up our ears. Waiting for the Other. The Counter. The Perpetrator. More and more we wanted the second narrative. And it had better be good. It had better be powerful. It had better display integrity. And it had better bring acute personal detail, tears and bewilderment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There can be no story without the balance of the antagonist. The ear and the heart simply cannot hold head above a one-way flood. The victims' hearings became less reported, less read; fewer hearings were scheduled. Why would one want the truth if the truth has turned its back: why would one confess before commissioners with as little power as oneself?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now and then, the muffled sound of a perpetrator in a court interdict or press release was heard. At the political submissions, no politician rose to the occasion. No single personal emotive moment was presented. When FW de Klerk said: &quot;I stand here before you today...&quot; - he was not standing, he was sitting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week the second narrative broke loose - unfocused, splintered in intention and grades of desperation. It was white. And it was male.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The human rights hearings had a definite starting point: the unforgettable wail of Nomondo Calata in East London. The uncontrollable muscle in the jaw of Brian Mitchell, who was involved in the Trust Feed Massacre, was for me the beginning of the perpetrator narrative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Judge Arthur Wilson asked him: &quot;Would you say you suffered a lot?&quot; the only answer Mitchell could muster was the frantically quivering jaw muscle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three main voices were heard last Monday: the army generals, the police generals and Eugene de Kock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I phoned the army headquarters: &quot;May I please interview General Georg Meiring?&quot; &quot;About what?&quot; &quot;About his submission, Monday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The general speaks to no one. He stands by his submission. He has nothing more to say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I want to know why Meiring is not presenting the submission of the old SADF?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm told to get lost in the ons-is-nog- steeds-baas-al-dink-jy-nie-so-nie tone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monday morning the military squad marches in for Operation Shut-up and Deny.  (Not to be confused with Operation Stratkom, Veikom and Komkom, Operation Skaap; Operation Paal and Pikkadel, Pebble and Porcelain.) And one has actually forgotten how they look: the clipped snorretjies, the shifty eyes, the arrogant circumnavigation of questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When General Deon Mortimer opened his mouth, a chill ran down my spine. I had forgotten the worst: the brutal Afrikaner accent and the unflinching tone.  The relish with which he pronounced the words &quot;ban&quot; and &quot;banning&quot;; the blatant use of the word &quot;terrorist&quot;, the cold-blooded smugness and excessiveness of the statistics: &quot;Mozambique: 23 May 1983. Operation Skerwe took place, using 12 Impalas and two Mirage F1 AZs, to attack known ANCfacilities in the Matola suburb of Maputo in retaliation for the car bomb detonation outside Air Force Headquarters, Pretoria, on 20 May. Two ANC houses and a headquarter were attacked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No press conference, no interview. And it was this, more than anything else, that changed the tone of the commission. Boraine leaned so far forward that only his head and neck were visible above the table when he slashed their submission to their face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Reverend Khoza Mgojo stammered in anger: &quot;You reel off these statistics, as if it's nothing. People, human beings died there. People whose families we've been listening to for the past six months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission seemed to say: before we are through with you, you will regard a statistic as human.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That same day in Johannesburg, former police general Johan van der Merwe walked in. He looked surprisingly well and confident. Such was not the case last year when he came to Parliament to make a submission to the Justice Committee on the Truth and Reconciliation Act. Without his uniform and cap he seemed shrunken. Collapsed he sat, his skin colour an unhealthy yellow. He blinked his eyes continuously and sometimes his mouth nibbled like that of an old man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the Justice Committe, his case was put by an English-speaking advocate from KwaZulu- Natal. Flashy-suited and golden-ringed, the advocate made it clear that this was not the type of case he normally took, but ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advocate told the committee: &quot;On the plane the general and I talked about the submission ... and after a long, long time, he said, barely audibly: 'I started my career with so much idealism, so many dreams. I've put into it all I've had, but because of the politicians I sit today wrapped in shame.  Today I am not only old, I am also disgraced ... because of politics.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He might not have said much at the amnesty hearing, but he identified with his underlings - something which no powerful person from the previous regime had done yet. He also spelled out the difference between politician and soldier: the one makes the decision, the other carries it out. The better you carry it out, the better a soldier you are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Come Monday night, come Prime Evil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shot one: men on the beach. Some naked, some swimming, some playing in the sand. Only De Kock brooding among them - dressed from head to toe, his clothes like a shell. The man who refused in court to cede any death to someone else. Jealously he held vigil that not a dot of his atrocities get lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shot two: the confession of Jacques Pauw. Bheki Mlangeni was killed by rigged earphones originally meant for Dirk Coetzee, who identified the package and asked Pauw to warn Mlangeni, which Pauw did not do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Coetzee, the man who made him famous, Pauw also preferred to confess publicly and dramatically. He chose to let the obvious moment for confession pass by - the moment after he had interviewed the distraught and weeping Sepati Mlangeni. The moment he was alone with her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why was this the obvious moment? Pauw, then, would have stepped out of his own safe framework, out of the story as dictated by him, out of the powerful realm of media and history. Pauw would have been at the mercy of Sepati Mlangeni - as her husband was at his - to forgive or condemn. It would have shown Pauw vulnerable - as vulnerable as millions of black people were under a racist government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or are things simpler than that? People perhaps find it easier to ask forgiveness from Archbiship Desmond Tutu or the whole television-watching South Africa than from an ordinary black woman in her house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then, too, the fear of rejection may be worse than the guilt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unexpected overtones accompanied the second narrative this week at the book launch of Reconciliation Through Truth by Kader Asmal, Louise Asmal and Ronals Suresh Roberts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The book states very precisely: the truth commission won't be able to fulfil its implicit mandate to create a new moral order if it does not make a distinction between those who fought against and those who defended apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an old debate, but the writers give a new dimension. They spell out that, unlike the commissioners' claim, there is no imperative in the legislation not to make any distinction between the perpetrators and the victims of the two sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not a question of bad apples on both sides, said Kader Asmal, it is a question of a bad tree and a good tree. The book asks: if the truth commission cannot distinguish between right and wrong, how can it weave a new moral fabric?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The night of the launch also provided an opportunity to hear Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's thinking on reconciliation - an issue he seldom dwells on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apartheid forced the individual to abdicate his or her personal morality,&quot; he said. &quot;And if you think I say this because I am very intelligent ... I am only quoting the book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He speaks: &quot;The only thing that will heal this country is large doses of truth -and the truth is that apartheid was a form of genocide and a crime against humanity. You, Kader, I, Sam ... oh, I see you have not invited the ministers with which you are not on a good footing to the stage - people like Sydney and Essop ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After which Asmal nervously laughs and says: &quot;They were late.&quot; But it was obvious from the well-formulated speech that the days of visiting Betsie Verwoerd and drinking tea with Afrikaner tannies are over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The days of bending backwards from the coccygeal region to accommodate, to grit teeth in tolerance until the fillings fly, is over. Reconciliation will only be possible if the whites say: apartheid was evil and we were responsible for it. Resisting it was justified - even if excesses occurred within this framework.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbeki said that if this acknowledgement is not forthcoming, reconciliation is no longer on the agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although this political line is timeous, it also keeps the acknowledgement within the black and white realm and gives no guidance on how the individual could move forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The human rights violations hearings have forced the truth commission to formulate the same issue differently - a way which takes it out of the colour- code, making it user- friendly to all South Africans as a future guideline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The human rights of black people were violated by whites, but also by blacks instigated by whites. So the truth commission was forced to say: South Africa's shameful apartheid past has made people lose their humanity. It dehumanised people to such an extent that they treated fellow human beings worse than animals. And this must change forever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both lines try to drive the change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the debate flourishes around ANC amnesty, some vibrations stir the Waters of the Wilderness. As the Crocodile flounders, he bares his last remaining teeth. His last line of defence is his secretary, Mrs Hartman. &quot;Mr Botha is deeply religious,&quot; she tells a journalist. &quot;He knows his Bible. He will speak when the time is right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also said:&quot;Mr Botha walks around with a big smile on his face. He says he expected it all to happen. After all, people said bad things about Hitler too afterwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poet Antjie Krog has won the Herzog Prize and the CAN Award for her poetry.  She reports on the Truth Commission for SABC radio.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It was 1965 in Witbank, and Lizzie liked Harold for his looks and his humility. They got married on April 27, a date not lost on Lizzie for its later historical value. But by the time that date rung in a democratic South Africa almost three decades later, her husband was long gone - a victim of the forces that would have stopped April 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week former security policeman Paul van Vuuren told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission how he had not believed Harold Sefolo when Sefolo told him the African National Congress would rule one day.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then Sefolo, whom Van Vuuren believed to be an ANC guerrilla, asked whether he could sing Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika. Sefolo sang before Van Vuuren and security branch colleagues Jacques Hechter and Joe Mamasela shocked him to death with a water pump generator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lizzie Sefolo can imagine why her husband sang. &quot;He did that. He just took off with whatever was in him at the time ... He wanted to show them his power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sefolo's bravery, while two comrades were being given the treatment he would shortly receive, has made for some of the most poignant testimony yet put before the commission. Lizzie Sefolo caused her own stir when she told the commission's amnesty committee, which is considering applications from Hechter, Van Vuuren and three others, that she doubted the commission was a means to reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're still feeling the pain. These people never came to us to ask for forgiveness. The government is doing this on our behalf ... It is people who should forgive each other, not the government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, she told the Mail &amp; Guardian later, it was a relief to hear the truth about how her husband, Jackson Maake and Andrew Makupe died in 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lizzie Sefolo met Harold Sefolo, a window dresser at a Witbank clothing store and an orphan who didn't complete his schooling as there was no one to support him, in 1965. &quot;He was 26 and I was 24, working for an optician ... He was a good-looking man and humble,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years later the couple got a house in Pretoria's Mamelodi township.  About four months before his death, Sefolo started his own business, a caf', in Witbank. When Mamasela abducted him from there, Lizzie Sefolo had been completely unaware of any police interest in her husband. She reported his disappearance to the police in Mamelodi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she heard nothing until January this year, when she read in a newspaper article (presumably on the confessions of Joe Mamasela) that her husband had been a victim of the police. &quot;All the time, we were looking for him. You can imagine how much we spent going up and down for the whole eight years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Vuuren told the commission Maake had been a police informer, but that he was suspected of being a double agent. He was taken to a remote spot outside Pretoria and shocked until he owned up to spying for the ANC. He also implicated Makupe, who, in turn, was abducted and tortured, and he implicated Sefolo as another member of the cell. So Mamasela was dispatched to pick him up in Witbank. After all three had been shocked to death, their bodies were blown up in Bophuthatswana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lizzie Sefolo said her husband had been a strong ANC supporter, but she doubted he had been involved in armed activities, as Van Vuuren claimed. He did travel to Swaziland and Lesotho from time to time as chair of a dancing club, but she did not know if he had been in touch with Umkhonto weSizwe there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's much I don't know; I only know he was supporting the ANC ... But I don't think he was involved in killing ... He used to like people and he was kind to everybody. He didn't want anybody to suffer ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they could have shot him, it would have been better. The treatment they gave to them, it hurts. He didn't deserve such a punishment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lizzie Sefolo would like the government to erect a small tombstone for her husband, Maake and Makupe at the spot they died. It is too late for burials, but at least the children and grandchildren could know this is where the men died. And she fears her own six children will, like her orphan father, be deprived of further education. She never remarried and can hardly support them on her shop assistant's wage. That is where the truth commission may help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l Dennis Neer, Eastern Cape MEC for Safety and Security, is being sued for defamation by a former security policeman after giving evidence about torture he endured during detention. Luke Conway, current police commander of internal security in Port Elizabeth, is claiming R150 000 in damages from Neer in the Eastern Cape Supreme Court on grounds that the MEC falsely claimed the police officer had tortured him in the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Freedom of Expression Institute recently warned the truth commission that witnesses before it did not enjoy sufficient legal protection.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In a furious debate over apartheid's status as a crime against humanity, Mpumalanga Premier Mathews Phosa this week lashed out at Cape Town academic Professor Hermann Giliomee as &quot;standing in the trenches of apartheid&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the eye of the storm, involving politicans, academics and journalists, is a book on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, co-authored by Water Affairs Minister Kader Asmal, which was the subject of a stinging review by Giliomee in The Cape Times. Giliomee, who opposes the truth commission, lambasted the book which offers a compendium of apartheid atrocities and expands the philosophy underpinning the truth commission as being amateurish and extmely one-sided.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his particular opinion triggering the furore which has since raged in the newspaper was his challenge to the book's thesis that apartheid was a crime against humanity. One reason Giliomee gives for this conclusion is that, given the close association of the term with the Holocaust, &quot;it would be necessary to back up such a charge with evidence of deliberate government intent to kill or starve blacks to death&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giliomee, who is also president of the South African Institute of Race Relations, concludes: &quot;The book will please those who want to criminalise the apartheid regime regardless of the consequences.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The review provoked an aggressive response from Asmal's co-author, Ronald Roberts, an associate of Johannesburg law firm Moseneke and Partners. Roberts said Giliomee, whom he claims was a writer of Cabinet memoranda for the apartheid government, was behaving &quot;like an over-aged infant throwing his toys from some strange, geriatric cot. As Giliomee would know had he read the book, crimes against humanity are not limited to deliberate killing but also include ... acts of persecution on racial or religious grounds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Roberts, Asmal, Giliomee, The Cape Times's contributing editor Gerald Shaw and African National Congress MP Dave Dalling were slugging it out at the Cape, Phosa inadvertently dived into the scrum. He said at the opening of a new newspaper, Mpumalanga Times: &quot;There is an unbecoming tendency developing which seeks to equate the struggle against apartheid with those who enforced it, despite the fact that apartheid was declared a crime against humanity by the United Nations.&quot; He added the ANC should not apply for amnesty for legitimate acts against apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phosa told the Mail &amp; Guardian afterwards that from his comments, Giliomee appeared to be standing &quot;four feet in the trenches of apartheid&quot;. He said it was &quot;preposterous&quot; to claim apartheid had not been a crime against humanity. &quot; Who is he to say that? Is he saying the rest of the world is wrong?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phosa said it was inevitable that the truth commission would concentrate on apartheid atrocities as opposed to acts committed by the ANC. &quot;Although there was no military victory, there was a moral and political defeat of National Party policy. It is in fact a miracle that the ANC broke so few eggs to make such a large omelette for South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A leading legal academic, who may not be named for professional reasons, said that the Holocaust was of course the ultimate crime against humanity but that did not mean that anything less was not. &quot;If you believe only half of what (Colonel Eugene) de Kock said then of course apartheid was a crime against humanity.&quot; He expressed the fear that as Giliomee claimed to be a liberal, his approach could &quot;undermine the future of liberalism in South Africa&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dalling wrote that it could be that Giliomee previously viewed &quot;the underdog as black and now as white and Afrikaner&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - I used to hate physical activities: school sports, organised games, teams, winning and losing and competition. But I love climbing. It is personal. The challenge is what you make of it. The complete physical and mental commitment is strangely relaxing. You are so committed you can't really worry about other things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea of climbing Everest came to me on November 19 last year, at about 9am. I was writing my master's thesis for the Rhodes University Journalism Department and living in a little flat in Grahamstown. I bought the Sunday Times to read over breakfast. There was an announcement of the planned expedition on the front page. It said they were looking for a woman to join the team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until the 1990s we weren't allowed to climb in the high Himalayas because of apartheid. The leader of the expedition, Ian Woodall, now wanted to plant the new South African flag on top of the world. Nelson Mandela had agreed to be patron.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have been rock climbing for 10 years. I'm no great shakes, but I am not a novice either. I've climbed all over Southern Africa and Europe as well as in the Peruvian Andes and Central Africa. But I had never thought of Everest. It was too big and too expensive and I didn't think I was in the league that gets invited on a sponsored expedition. But I immediately starting phoning around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was one of about 200 women from all over the country who wrote in. Six were invited to go to East Africa for selection, climbing Meru and Kilimanjaro, two of the highest mountains in Africa. Woodall chose Deshun Deysel, a young teacher from Ennerdale, a coloured township near Johannesburg, and myself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I met the rest of the team for the first time in Johannesburg: Andy de Klerk, Bruce Herrod, Andy Hackland and Ed February. We had a hectic last week trying to get everything finished. Woodall was frantically busy. I think it was hard on the other team members because it was too late for them to get involved. There was already a certain amount of strain on the team, personality clashes - all these male egos crashing into one another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before I left I sat down with my boyfriend and my parents and talked about the risks. I wrote up a will and we discussed what I wanted done with my body and so on. It is risky, but not suicidal. Everest has seen about 140 deaths.  About 670 people have climbed it, but of course thousands have tried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We flew into Katmandu, Nepal, and started the walk to the mountain. It took about 10 days. It was a funny period, a time of sounding each other out, trying to get a feel for the people on this team. The guys did not seem too keen on myself or Deysel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The walk was beautiful. Lush valleys with fast-flowing rivers down at the bottom and these settlements teetering on the side of slopes with little terraced fields. And then you start getting glimpses of the high Himalayas; a tiny white peak in the background. Then they get bigger. Each day you build the sense of expectation. You start to see Everest and the other peaks and that is amazing. Huge walls of snow and rock all the way into the sky. And then you are totally encircled by these mountains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was not there when the team split. I had bronchitis and Herrod had a touch of flu. The others had gone ahead, leaving us resting at Periche.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The split erupted over the behaviour of the team doctor, Charlotte Noble.  She had already been disciplined twice for disappearing on the trial, endangering herself and her patients. Only a few days before the split, all the team members had agreed to tell Noble that her behaviour was unacceptable.  This time she had illegally issued a course of drugs to a sherpani (female sherpa) suffering from kerosene burns. Foreigners are not allowed to simply give a course of drugs to Nepalese. You have to give them one pill at a time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody knew the sherpani had got these drugs. Then a friend of the sherpani went down with altitude sickness. The Nepalese tend to be very stoic about health. Late that afternoon, Herrod found her in a bad way. He broke out a gamma bag - like a body bag. You put the patient in, zip it and pump it up with oxygen. That's the only way to cure altitude sickness. They put the girl in and started questioning her friend as to what actually happened. The girl with the kerosene burns said: &quot;Oh she was feeling sick so I gave her these pills that I had.&quot; So they now had her in the gamma bag, all blown up, and couldn't search her without taking her off the oxygen which was keeping her alive. They didn't know whether it was altitude sickness or a drug overdose or allergic shock. The doctor was saying she was very, very ill and could die.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Herrod sent a message up the trail to Woodall who came back. They managed to stabilise her, get her out of the bag and search her and found the drugs that she hadn't taken. But Woodall went back up the trail and fired Noble and no doubt was very rude to her. The others seized on this as an excuse to resign. In fact they seemed to have hoped to force Woodall to hand over the leadership of the expedition to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three who had resigned came storming down the trail, accusing Woodall of being autocratic and dangerous. Although both Deysel and I were put under pressure to join them in leaving, we saw no reason to. I had no objections with the way Woodall led and had never seen him make a stupid or dangerous decision. Those who were resigning had given me no reason to trust them so I remained true to my commitment to try to climb Everest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was on this section of the climb that we ran into trouble with the Sunday Times, who were one of the expedition's 32 sponsors. The editor, Ken Owen, was retiring and coming to Everest as his swansong, planning to make it as far as Base Camp. Woodall and Owen met up two days from base camp and had their huge fight. In some ways I think Woodall and Owen are a little bit alike - hard-headed and blunt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next morning they tried to patch it up, but Owen stormed off back down the trail. He wrote a huge article for his half-million readers, denouncing us. How do ordinary mortals compete? You don't. All we could do was try and climb Everest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We got to Camp Two. Apart from preparing the camp, you have to acclimatise.  You can't just start at the bottom and climb to the top because you would fall over and die. You take your body and push it up to a certain level and you will inevitably feel sick, then come down. Your body starts producing more red blood cells so the oxygen can be carried more efficiently. So then you go back up to where you first felt sick and go up a little higher each day. We were ready, acclimatised, in the first week of May and prepared for the summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everest is so high that it sticks into the jet streams - winds howling about the world. But in May the jet streams lift and you normally get a window of two to three weeks when the winds are gone and Everest is climbable.  On about May 8 the winds were lifting and the two-week window seemed to have started. The Danish team had a connection with a big weather satellite system and they were predicting four days of completely calm, still weather. We moved up with three other teams to Camp Four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I came in half an hour ahead of Woodall and Herrod. They got caught in a storm. By the time they got into the camp they were really cold. I felt fine, but we decided to wait 24 hours to give Woodall and Herrod a chance to get their strength back. If Herrod and Woodall had felt stronger we probably would have tried for the summit. But we waited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At midnight, when you would normally leave from the top camp, the winds had died completely. The other three teams left then for the summit. But the following afternoon the storms came in and didn't lift for three days. We were trapped in howling, 160km/h winds with visibility down to one metre. It was bitterly cold. The other teams were trapped on the ridge above us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On our side of the mountain five died. After four days we made it back to base camp. The teams who had lost climbers and those with bad injuries, like the Taiwanese, packed up. Then some of the other teams decided that they had also had enough and left. We did a lot of sitting and watching people head down the trial. You knew they were going to hot baths and warm beds and families; it was quite tempting to chuck it all in. But it wasn't really. I had shown myself that I could get to Camp 4 and I had yet to be stopped by my own limitations. I still didn't think I could do Everest, but I knew I could go further. I wanted another try.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We got together after a couple of days at Base Camp and I remember Woodall saying: &quot;Shall we talk it through?&quot; Herrod and I looked at each other and Bruce said: &quot;I think we've decided already.&quot; So we started off again and went all the way up to Camp Two and watched the wind howl!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was very disconcerting. The two-week window we were expecting just never happened. It's been said we had some of the worst weather that's been seen on Everest in 10 years. All we could do was watch the wind. By then we were also getting an idea of the negative press coverage back home and it was very demoralising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We were sitting up there feeling a bit depressed when we got a telephone call. It was about lunchtime at Camp Two. Camped next to us was a team from the United States who were making an IMAX movie. They were led by a very flamboyant adventurer-come-film director called David. He was obviously an important person and, although he talked to the other US and British teams, he had never said as much as a &quot;hello&quot; to the South Africans. He had a satellite phone and would walk back and forth outside his tent doing business on it. At one point he was negotiating with Colombia Pictures. We used to watch him - it was something to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On this particular day he was pacing as usual and suddenly broke off to come came over to us. &quot;Nelson Mandela's on the phone for you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At first we thought he was joking. But it was Mandela. I still don't know why he called at that moment, but it made such a difference! He said he was proud of us going up the second time and wished us well. It was a huge boost to our morale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then Deysel decided she had had enough and was going back down. We moved up to Camp Three; that long slog again, up the Lhotse face, thinking at every step: &quot;That's the last time I take that particular step.&quot; We did it this time, or we never did it. We made it to Camp Three and spent the night there. In the morning the wind was howling again. Back we went to Camp Two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wind died again. We were getting some reasonable weather reports, so back we went, now really cursing every step. It had to be the last attempt: it was only a week short of the monsoon. We were picking up reports on Nepalese radio, on the progress of the monsoon and we knew it would be with us in a week. This time there was no question; it was the last chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally the weather broke and we got a window. At about lunch time on May 24 we reached Camp Four. It looked good. We called South Africa to say we were going to go. And then we tried to get ready - selecting clothing we were going to wear, sorting camera equipment, tying flags to ice-axes and trying to eat and drink as much as we could. It's incredible how long it takes you, in those conditions, to do simple things like getting dressed, packing a rucksack. And we tried to sleep. Of course you don't sleep. I just lay there, my mind going round and round in circles and my stomach all knotted up with excitement, fear and impatience. Waiting for midnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You leave at midnight, because it's too far to get there and back in daylight. If you're going to climb in the dark, you might as well start off in the dark. We left at about 12.20am; Herrod, Woodall and myself and three of the sherpas, moving up the face of Everest by the light of our head- torches. Most of the time you could only see the yellow bubble from the torch in front of you. But there were electrical storms on the horizon. It would be completely dark and then suddenly a sheet of lightning flashed across the sky and we could see the mountains silhouetted in black. Then it would all vanish in pitch dark. It was weird, but very beautiful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was treacherous, climbing; quite steep, with a mixture of loose snow and loose rock - rubble almost - underfoot. It was surprisingly warm, warmer than when we were on Kilimanjaro, and we were sweating in our suits. We were wearing full down suits, like enormous sleeping bags with arms and legs.  Michelin Man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We climbed the slope in the dark and reached the junction with the ridge as the sun came up. It was amazing; the sun rising over the Tibetan Plateau.  Everything turns pink. It was the first time we could see where we were - mountains and valleys in every direction. The sun cast a shadow from Everest - a perfectly triangular shadow running all the way to the horizon, which is a hell of a long way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We could see the south summit, but we still could not see the true summit, so we could not see how much further we had to go. I was taking it one hour at a time, seeing how high I could get, with the south summit being the cherry on the cake. I still didn't expect to get to the top.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woodall was ahead, disappearing over the south summit with Pemba Sherpa. We didn't climb with sherpas holding our hands. Our sherpas were on the mountain to help us carry loads up to Camp Four. But after that they were climbers, like us, and they weren't expected to be glued to us. I had in fact out- climbed the next two sherpas by about an hour by then. Herrod was just behind them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I got to the top of the south summit and for the first time saw the ridge.  It was spectacular; a winding, knife-edge with a drop of 2 500m on the Nepalese side and 3000m on the Tibetan side, on to the glacier. It is like walking a plank, a normal 60cm-wide plank. Put a plank on the floor and you are not going to fall off it. But a plank with an 3 000m drop on either side of it ! It's no more difficult, but it is scary. The ridge was not terribly difficult technically, but it was nerve-racking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another problem with the ridge is cornices; the wind blows the snow up on one side and actually makes a wave, hanging over the edge. You can't see where the wave starts and the mountain stops. If you misjudge it the wave will break under your weight and you will fall with it. It's a balancing act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ridge has a lot of false summits, ups and downs, so I couldn't see Woodall and Pemba even though they were just in front of me. I could see the Hilary Step, which is the one rock problem on the ridge. And I thought: &quot;I can make it!&quot; That was one of the great moments, standing on that ridge and realising that this was what lay between me and the summit and I was capable of doing it. I was still not certain that I was going to get there, but I was capable and I was going to try.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'd read about the false summits and knew they were coming. So as each one loomed up I thought: &quot;No, no, don't expect anything, just keep going.&quot; I'd get to the top of it and sure enough there would be another one ahead. Get to the top of that and there'd be another one ... And then, finally, I came over yet another one and ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You're in this funny world; it's almost like climbing in a monochrome picture, white snow, blue sky and black rock. That is it. Nothing else whatsoever. I came over this last false summit and there was a burst of colour. It was the prayer flags the sherpas leave on the summit -incredibly vivid blues and yellows and reds and greens. Woodall and Pemba were sitting there, just under the flags. I still wasn't quite sure if it was the summit or not and then Pemba turned round and saw me and he just had this huge grin on his face ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He began waving his arms at me. Then I knew I'd climbed Everest. I was about 10m from it. And that was another amazing moment; almost more so than standing on the summit itself. I knew that I was going to do it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I joined them. Woodall had been talking on the radio and he gave it to me.  They had my mother in the studio in Johannesburg. She wanted to know what it looked like. I did a terrible job describing it because it was so difficult.  You are standing on this point, higher than anything on earth, with this 360- degree panorama of mountains everywhere. You can see right over the Himalayas into the back end of India. You can see right across the Tibetan Plateau. You are so high you can see the earth beginning to curve. It was so difficult to try and put it into words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We took the summit pictures. And finally Woodall and I planted the South African flag. After two months of howling wind, the flag just flopped. The weather was so great, it was absolutely still; if you look at the pictures you can see we actually had to hold the flag up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We spent about quarter of an hour on the top - all that work, for 15 minutes! Woodall and Pemba were keen to start moving down. I was terribly conscious of the fact that it isn't like a marathon, when you cross the finishing line it isn't over. Every step you took on the way up you have to take again, going down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we got moving. Just before we reached the south summit we passed the other two sherpas on their way up and talked to them briefly. As leader of the expedition Woodall could have ordered the sherpas to turn round and go down. You pay the sherpas a bonus in dollars for each camp they reach and a fairly hefty one for the summit and there are plenty of teams that will take their sherpas as far as the south summit and leave them there, because they don't have to pay as much. But when Woodall employed our guides he guaranteed they would have a chance to go to the summit. Even if all the members - the Westerners - gave up, got sick, went home, they could go. And that's what they were doing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We came over the top of the south summit and found Herrod, still on his way up. I came down and sort of balanced on this ridge and got this huge, precarious hug from him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We sat down together in the snow, took off the oxygen masks and had a long talk. He said that he'd been going slowly, that he was feeling strong. He was very pleased that we'd made it because it meant that the expedition as a whole was now a success. He wanted to know what he could expect. As an experienced mountaineer, it surely never crossed his mind that we might try and turn him round. It was a successful expedition and now he wanted a personal success. And quite frankly it didn't cross my mind to turn him around either. It was the middle of the day. He had seven to eight hours of light left, good weather, plenty of oxygen - we had some oxygen to spare which we stashed for him. He had a radio. He said he would take it one hour at a time and see how far he could get -and that's how we left it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We wished him luck and he went up and we went down and ... we never saw him again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he got to the south summit he radioed base camp and said that the ridge looked do- able. When he got to the summit he radioed us - we were back at Camp Four by then. He spoke to Woodall, to base camp, to his girlfriend in London. He spoke to Woodall again and they had a long conversation, Woodall telling him to be careful moving across the ridge and describing where we had stashed the oxygen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have tape recordings of his voice. It wasn't the voice of a tired, frightened climber who's desperate to be someplace else. He was just very chuffed that he'd done it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We sat waiting for him at Camp Four with the radio on. We were terribly tired and eventually fell asleep. When I woke up the next morning at about 5am, and he hadn't radioed, I realised we had lost him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are pretty sure he fell off the very narrow section of the ridge. It was hell coming down. Stupid little things; you try to tread in the footprints left by other climbers so you are always looking down. But every time you look down, you get hot air coming from the top of your oxygen mask and your sun-glasses fog up; you have to wear glasses because of the danger of sun blindness. So you're trying to clear your glasses with your gloves and the gloves have got ice on them ... It's an ongoing nightmare and it would be so easy to slip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US team had abandoned a number of half- empty oxygen bottles. I scavenged all I could find. One person could wait twice as long as two. The sherpas had all made it safely and had already headed back down. I followed, leaving Woodall who waited until he ran out of oxygen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We got back to base camp and there was this awful mix of emotions. People didn't know what to do ... to say &quot;well done&quot;, or &quot;bad luck&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I loved it. Of course it was great reaching the summit. But it was just being on the mountain that I enjoyed. Watching the wind brewing, the companionship ... I have all sorts of memories about Herrod.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many people don't understand how that kind of team works. Because you don't walk together all the time they think we're all in it for ourselves, we're selfish. It's not like that at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team isn't about being physically next to the others. It's about having them kick you out of bed in the morning when you really don't want to get up.  It was about having a cup of tea and an arm round my shoulders when I was feeling totally depressed. It's about having them there at the end of the day, just being able to share the experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it is a spiritual experience in a funny sort of way. It is about trying.  And I'm proud of having tried so hard in the face of all sorts of shit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it's so beautiful. So magnificent. The mountain ...</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phalaborwa - Phalaborwa is the type of mining town where streets are still named after the likes of presidents Steyn and Kruger. Its burghers give the impression they'd cart change to town on an oxwagon - proud of traditions that have sustained them, blissfully innocent of the advantages of modern transport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few kilometres to the west, about 40 lean young men in camouflage uniforms, their expert training apparent in the precise choreography of their attack, race with guns rattling towards a mock target. Their mode of transport is a tough little all-terrain battle-wagon whose futuristic design angles would win it pride of place on the set of a Mad Max remake. Eat dust, slow-trekking Phalaborwans!</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the battle-wagon, especially developed and built for these soldiers, is called the Vlermuis. &quot;It's not a 'bat',&quot; says Colonel Julius Engelbrecht, commanding officer of 5 Special Forces Regiment. &quot;You cannot translate it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps Engelbrecht has a point. Five Recce, as his unit is commonly known, has members of 21 ethnic groups, speakers of about 24 languages. Naming your vehicle a &quot;bat&quot; in 24 languages could be problematic. Traditionally, the command language of Five Recce would have been Afrikaans, so why not stick to Afrikaans?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extend that logic: Five Recce's base outside Phalaborwa has its own multi- denominational church, the United Church of the Conqueror. This soldiers' church has incorporated military paraphernalia into its practice of religion such as the baptismal font consisting of a polished upside-down helmet on heavy-calibre shells. The church interior also sports two old-South Africa flags - the &quot;national colours&quot; earned by the regiment which were &quot;laid down&quot; in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a glass case next to the pulpit contains the standard of old-Rhodesia's (extremely notorious) Selous Scouts. The padre explains that so revered is the scouts' martial legacy, and their inspiration for South Africa's own special forces, that elements of their standard remain in the insignia of the church and of Five Recce itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A military unit, especially if it is probably the most elite in the country, can hardly have no tradition, and if the only available tradition dates from the wars and battles fought across the region by apartheid South Africa, why not stick to that tradition, the argument seems to go, again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, as with the slow burghers of Phalaborwa, change is coming slowly to Five Recce - Vlermuis or no Vlermuis. The tradition which sustained Five Recce as one of apartheid South Africa's most effective military units - reconnoitring and destabilising deep behind the lines in Angola, running Renamo rebel operations across the Kruger National Park in nearby Mozambique, perhaps even taking sides in the violence-wracked South African townships - may have become the factor to blind its proud soldiers to the need for change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tour the base for confirmation of this: the mess building's walls sport photographs of old Boer fighters and a trophy, consisting of a shot-up AK-47 (symbolism: the defeat of the liberation movements), which was once awarded to soldier Willem Ratte, now better known as the right-wing occupier of Fort Schanskop and subsequent hunger striker. Other walls are decorated with articles and montages dealing with subjects like the recces' superiority over their foreign counterparts &quot;in spite of sanctions&quot;, or the disbandment of the (notorious) 32 Battalion, which fought side- by-side with Five Recce in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then there is the empty, remote room used for the &quot;dark phase&quot;, when recruits' training is almost over. The recruits would be captured and taken there by the &quot;enemy&quot;, who would try and &quot;turn&quot; them. The room's walls are covered with &quot;enemy&quot; graffiti - in this case proclaiming &quot;Viva ANC&quot;, &quot;Viva UDF&quot; and &quot;Down with the Boere&quot;. This room is supposedly no longer in use, but the graffiti remains - two-and-a-half years after the enemy became the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What appears to have saved embarrassment so far is that those who might have been offended by the Five Recce tradition have hardly been confronted by it. While the unit has been racially mixed since its foundation in 1979/80 (because the generals had identified a need for black soldiers in &quot;pseudo&quot; operations), the regiment is not integrated in the same sense as much of the rest of the army. So far, former Umkhonto weSizwe and Apla soldiers have not made it past the stringent selection criteria, although a few are in the pipeline and a few serve in a supporting capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Engelbrecht and his top command appear to realise they live in a new country. A media visit last week to their base, at their invitation, was a first - and it was in the name of transparency. Ironically, if what the journalists found was an army base still struggling to emerge from a pre-1994 timewarp, the present government may have sent the signals that put Engelbrecht and company at ease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1993, FW de Klerk's National Party government, mindful of the need to move away, at least publicly, from all that represented the old South Africa, changed Five Recce's name to 452 Parachute Regiment. Two years later, publicly unannounced, Nelson Mandela's ANC government changed the name back to 5 Special Forces Regiment. &quot;They said they did not have a problem with it: they needed special forces,&quot; says a South African National Defence Force (SANDF) member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela put that need to graphic illustration when he ordered the SANDF to end a police mutiny in Umtata in February last year. Five Recce was given the task. They boast that 30 of them, the total Recce deployment (sent in on the backs of Vlermuise, of course), sent more than 1 000 mutineers scurrying. One mutineer died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skilled in the arts of bush war - infiltration, survival, reconnaisance, sabotage - one change that Five Recce's soldiers have had to accept is that, for now, their job will involve little bush. Like many other SANDF units, they are deployed inside the country in support of the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brigadier Borries Bornman, commander of special forces, this week agreed that Five Recce still clung to its old traditions. &quot;What you are saying I can find no fault with - these are the facts - but you have to understand that it takes time to build a new tradition ... The core of the unit is still from the old dispensation, but these guys are not politicians. They want to stay, and they feel they have a future here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bornman said the old-South Africa flag &quot;national colours&quot; were displayed in the church in the absence of a military museum - which the unit would get next year - but would not be displayed on parade or at functions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The 17 universities and technikons created for blacks are struggling to survive in the post-apartheid era. Some face closure unless drastic rescue efforts are put in train.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 100 000 students are at the universities with more than 30 000 at the technikons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The warning about their plight comes from Professor Cecil Abrahams, vice- chancellor of the University of the Western Cape (UWC) and a committee member of the Historically Disadvantaged Tertiary Education Institutions (HDIs).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abrahams declined in an interview with the Mail &amp; Guardian to name any particular institution, but said: &quot;You could just look at the amount of debt and the lack of academic and support services infrastructure some of them are faced with ... to realise they will not survive, but others are better placed.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the institutions he has in mind seems to be the University of Zululand (UniZulu) which is carrying a debt of R20-million incurred by former students. UniZulu representative Carl de Villiers said there was little chance of recovering a large part of this. Some of it was owed by students who had completed their courses but would not get their degrees until they paid. But the biggest portion was owed by drop-outs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Villiers said the outlook for UniZulu was bleak because, unlike former white universities, the HDIs did not have cash reserves on which to fall back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Abrahams said there was a growing perception that historically black campuses were second-class institutions, despite having been the pride of the majority in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the HDIs, which have made it their mission to serve the disadvantaged, remained critically under-funded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have not yet received the attention to make us compete (with former white counterparts). Sometimes we feel that racial problems (on former white campuses) are getting more attention while substantial issues at HDIs are ignored.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from the funding problem the number of students at HDIs was growing faster than could be accommodated, he noted. For example, UWC had an average student-lecturer ratio of 31:1 compared with 14:1 at its neighbours - the University of Cape Town, the Cape Technikon and Stellenbosch University.  Getting students from poor high school backgrounds, he said, meant more resources needed to be spent on bridging programmes. &quot;The problem is not one of attracting students to our institution, but we are drawing students with the weakest matriculation results.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of better resources and facilities, former white universities and technikons were &quot;drawing students from the cream of the crop&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Abrahams, many of the institutions expected conditions to improve in the new political order, and instead have found themselves pushed to the verge of complete marginalisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Echoing this, the vice-chancellor of the University of Fort Hare, Professor Mbulelo Mzamane, told the M&amp;G: &quot;As we emerged from the past as a historically disadvantaged institution, we had hoped to get a post- apartheid dividend, from the new democratic government, as a reward for our heroic struggle against apartheid over the years. We are still waiting for this - two years into independence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The University of the Western Cape's registrar for finance Andre de Wet said it took at least two years to recover 70% of money owed by students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a bid to deal with these problems faculty deans from several historically black universities and technikons met in Mmabatho last month and agreed that isolation and inadequate funding were key obstacles faced by the HDIs in competing with former white counterparts. They decided to strengthen links with each other and discussed ways to &quot;enhance academic excellence&quot;.  They plan to co-ordinate research and to campaign for funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Phineas Mabetoa, dean of the faculty of health and social sciences at the University of the North West, told the M&amp;G: &quot;Our aim is to get all the country's tertiary education institutions together, especially our white counterparts who are well-endowed with facilities and human resources.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Mmabatho meeting was weakened by the fact that only five of the country's 17 HDIs attended. Organisers said this was due to poor communication and late invitations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other interviews with the M&amp;G, Professor Joe Teffo, executive assistant to the vice- chancellor at the University of the North, said HDIs had to design &quot;innovative&quot; methods and create a culture of learning to attract the best students and staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There has been a discrepancy in funding and developing of infrastructure but we should make the best out of the worst conditions,&quot; he said. Academics moving to the former white universities, &quot;to beef up already advanced institutions&quot;, were perpetuating the imbalances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national president of the South African Students' Congress (Sasco), David Makhura, said the curricula at some of the HDIs were &quot;shameful&quot; as they still reflected the past educational system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The HDIs should be given adequate resources because the competition for students remained unfairly in favour of the former white campuses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makhura added: &quot;We want every institution to be developed into a truly South African institution. What the former white institutions have is resources and infrastructure. But their values, academic research and so on should be directed to the people of South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A representative of the University of Venda, Rufus Kharidzha, said the government had to develop a special funding system for the HDIs. The current system whereby natural sciences received higher government subsidies was unfair because the majority of black students studied non-science subjects.  The University of Venda, he said, had 7 000 students - more than double its planned 3 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministry of Education representative Lincoln Mali said it would be of little use to dish out money without having a proper policy in place. A green paper on high education, to be issued soon, will deal with funding and other matters aimed at redressing past imbalances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the brain-drain by academics to former white campuses or to government, Mali said: &quot;That is a matter of individual choice but as part of the redress factor the government will look at staff development.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - American-style demonstrations outside hospitals and clinics where abortions are performed will be the norm in South Africa, the country's biggest pro-life grouping warned this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Glynnis Newbury, of Pro-Life, said the organisation would &quot;do everything in its power&quot; to stop the &quot;killing of babies&quot;. This would include protests targeting women on their way to hospitals and clinics to have an abortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newbury said pro-lifers would not commit violence as they were committed to &quot;stopping the violence of abortion&quot;. However, she had scant sympathy for medical staff who were victims of violence in pro-life protests.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In America, about five or six doctors who are abortion providers have been killed or injured since 1972. At the same time, they've been killing an average of two million babies a year. And people want to talk about the violent pro-lifers? People who have killed abortion providers overseas are not members of pro-life groups, but pro-choice people usually insinuate that they are. We totally deny that we are planning violent action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministry of Health spokesman Vincent Hlongwane said if the law allowed access to hospitals and clinics and the access was denied to anyone the law would have to take its course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The police would have to do what they are trained to do if a small group of people decides to block our health facilities,&quot; Hlongwane said. The chairman of the parliamentary portfolio committee on health, Dr Abe Nkomo, has voiced fears that right-wing church groups in South Africa were being bankrolled by American extremist anti-abortion groups which have been linked to violence in their own country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the run-up to his committee's hearing on the pregnancy bill two weeks ago, anti- abortion groups sent its members horrific pictures of foetuses.  MPs were also sent letters warning that &quot;there will never be peace in South Africa until there is peace in the womb&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the leading lights in the pro-life movement had been at the forefront of the Christians for the Truth campaign in the late 1980s which had campaigned against liberation theology in South Africa. These groups were linked to right-wing American religious groups like the Moral Majority and Family Life Coalition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwean author Paul Giffard's book in the 1980s, New Crusaders: Christians and the New Right in Southern Africa, traced these links and named former Rhodesian right-winger, the Reverend Peter Hammond, as a pro-Unita, pro- Renamo cleric who had denounced liberation theologists as communists.  Hammond was jailed in Mozambique after being caught entering the country illegally, which he had done on many occasions during his relationship with Renamo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hammond now lives in Cape Town and heads United Christian Action, a pro- life group which is also intent on protesting outside clinics and hospitals where abortions are performed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newbury said Pro-Life was the largest South African anti-abortion lobby group and had never been offered funding from American organisations. &quot;We would love to know where those dollars have gone. We'd have no problem accepting it, after all the South African government gets money from America.  Abortionists earn good salaries while pro- life groupings are mostly staffed by volunteers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newbury said she had little doubt that private clinics would be established to provide abortions in South Africa as the state health system was already over-extended and some women would not want to queue for hours or accept inferior treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are going to be outside the abortoriums and when women see that there are people outside who are willing to give up their time to support them and offer alternatives, we will change their minds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pro-Life would continue its anti-abortion campaign by extending its services to women seeking alternatives to abortion. They could be offered funding, housing and support if they required it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation is also considering a campaign to withhold taxes and to lobby parliamentarians to use taxes to assist women who wanted to give birth to live babies and put them up for adoption. They will also assist medical personnel who object to participating in abortions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the outset, we are going to fight to repeal this law with all legal means at our disposal, including the Constitutional Court,&quot; said Newbury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Christian Action spokesman Miriam Payne said although her organisation did not receive US funding, it gained information from there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know any pro-life group which is well-funded in South Africa and anyone who suggests we have links with extremists in America is slanderous,&quot; she said. &quot;I certainly don't think standing outside an abortion clinic with a placard saying 'abortion kills babies' or a model of a 12- week-old foetus is violent. If we want to intervene to stop an abortion, one place we can reach women planning to do so is outside clinics and hospitals.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad) campaign in Cape Town is beginning to affect police attempts to combat crime, the South African Police Service (SAPS) claimed this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western Cape police representative, senior superintendent John Sterrenberg, said between April and last week Pagad held 43 demonstrations and marches which have been policed by 4 328 members of the SAPS and 2 075 members of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF). This cost the taxpayer more than R1-million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Besides the potential for conflict, the police have to monitor Pagad's activities to ensure the rights of the individual to peaceful protest as well as protecting the rights of all citizens,&quot; Sterrenberg said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pagad split into two factions last month. One faction is led by the organisation's original leaders, Farouk Jaffer and Ali Phantom Parker, the other by militant Muslim group Qibla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sterrenberg said the split meant there were two marches or demonstrations almost every Wednesday and Saturday and this effectively tied up hundreds of policemen who could better occupy their time fighting crime. Not true, said Farouk Jaffer. He claimed that since Pagad began its campaign, crime in the Cape had decreased by 23%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gangsters and dealers are now aware that their neighbours and their communities are watching them, and some have stopped their illegal activities, &quot; Jaffer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is because of us, not because of the police. The police are just too lazy to do their work properly and like to blame us for giving them extra work to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past week, police have clamped down on Pagad after warning them that they would no longer tolerate the carrying of arms in public and wearing disguises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday, nine members of the Qibla faction were arrested at a march in Atlantis and warned to appear in court to face charges relating to carrying weapons at a march and charges under the Prohibition of Disguises Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstrators were arrested after a scuffle with police where they refused to hand over weapons they were carrying publicly. Police confiscated pistols and shotguns, all of which were licensed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jaffer said his Pagad faction was prepared to co-operate with the police to an extent. &quot;We have agreed with them as far as hiding our faces is concerned, except for the women, they have to wear scarves as it is part of their purdah.  &quot;We have also explained to the police that sometimes members of the community assist us by pointing out dealers and gangsters. Such persons have to cover their faces for their own protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As far as firearms are concerned, if the police won't allow us to protect ourselves during our marches, they will just have to continue coming to every march with their guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If anything should happen to any of us because we are not armed, we are going to hold the police responsible and sue them from here to Timbuktu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of the members of the Qibla-led faction of Pagad could be contacted for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sterrenberg said the police again called on any people intending to exercise their right to peaceful protest to ensure that it remained peaceful and did not infringe on the rights of others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We ask that participants in demonstrations stay within the parameters of the law and heed the reasonable requests of police.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Security for the matric exams was so lax and the loopholes so many that the Gauteng Department of Education this week replaced many of the 700 officials of its examinations unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, it is hoped, will halt any more of the leaks which have cast a pall over the first non-racial examinations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Subethri Naidoo, representative for Gauteng Education MEC Mary Metcalfe: &quot;We are in such a state of not knowing where the leaks occurred that we even had to replace some management staff and get more senior people to deal with issues such as packaging.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not saying all of them were involved, but we couldn't take the risk of keeping them there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She would not give the exact number of staff involved, but added that most were in the printing and packaging sections. These staff members had been moved to other sections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department's drastic move came as the leaks triggered widespread public anxiety. Four inquiries have been launched: an investigation by Public Protector Selby Baqwa, an internal education department probe, a commission of inquiry appointed by Metcalfe, and an investigation by the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the department and police say they are close to a breakthrough, Naidoo admitted that whatever evidence they have is circumstantial and perpetrators could escape on technicalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaks were the work of crime syndicates and people acting alone, fuelled by inexperienced staff and &quot;a few old guard&quot; set on discrediting the department, she said. The replacement did not discriminate between the old and new bureaucrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said fewer people than before were now involved in the new security arrangements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior official who did want to be named said that after the leak of the accountancy paper was discovered the department found English and Afrikaans versions stapled together. This showed internal complicity, said the source, because if the rules had been followed exam papers in the two languages would have been handled by separate officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has so far been confirmed that the accountancy paper, which should have been written last week, was stolen and sold for up to R2 000. The exam has been postponed to November 27. Police say rumours that an algebra questionnaire was on the Internet have not been substantiated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some pupils in Laudium in Pretoria and Lenasia in Johannesburg said sets of papers for all subjects were going for R35 000. But the theft of exam papers is &quot;by no means new&quot;, Naidoo said. And unlike in the past the new department was doing something to stop the leaks, which had become &quot;chronic&quot; in the education system over the years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Role players in education circles called for tougher action. South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) representative Kate Skinner said they have insisted that all remaining question papers be redrafted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naidoo would not say whether this would be done, but confirmed that &quot;a number&quot; of papers had already been changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soweto's Orlando High School principal, George Mchunu, said officials knew leakages would occur because the examinations were being held on such a large scale. &quot;There were quite a few instances of leaks in the old department of education and training and this department should have made provisions to counter the possibility of leaks,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parktown Boys' High principal Tom Clarke said reports that the current matric exams carried no weight were giving pupils and parents the wrong perception about the standard of the exam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Instead of questioning the standard of the exam we should rather attack the administration for their slackness and incompetence,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It was certainly three times lucky for &quot;Lucky&quot; Malaza. The convicted bank robber, mistakenly released from jail four years ago as a political prisoner, was recently arrested by the police for kidnapping, but released within an hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charges were dropped against him when the victim refused to give evidence and the man with Houdini-like instincts for survival walked free again.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malaza, who has also been bailed for an alleged bank robbery in Mmabatho, was identified as one of a group of South Africans said to be preying on Nigerian drug pushers in Hillbrow and Berea, Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police were alerted after Nigerian refugees reported that they had been kidnapped, tortured and held for ransoms of up to R10000 over the past two months - at least 28 people had fallen victim before the authorities were informed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malaza, who served about three years of a 16- year sentence before being granted political indemnity, was arrested with two other men during a sting operation. But the Nigerians claimed they were too afraid of reprisals to press charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kidnapping is the latest crime craze to hit South Africa and police have warned that although it may have started with Nigerians of questionable status, there is a danger that it may emerge as popular a trend as the scourge of hijacking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have heard that it is happening in different parts of Johannesburg and that other African nationalities are being targeted,&quot; said Captain Mark Momberg of Hillbrow Police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He recently had to warn a prominent Ghanaian businessman that his name was on a list of potential targets, and has issued concerned Nigerians with police cellphone numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Local gangs are looking at this as a way of making easy money and we want to stop this thing before it gets out of hand,&quot; Momberg explained. &quot;Obviously there is a danger that this could spread and become a much bigger problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ikenna, a smartly dressed Nigerian who sells drugs from the corner of O'Reilly and Tudhope roads in Hillbrow, said the kidnappers usually pass themselves off as police officers taking people in for questioning. The victims are then driven into Soweto and beaten into giving the name of friends or relatives who are then phoned and a ransom demanded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We usually negotiate the money to between R3000 and R5 000, then they name a place in Rosebank for the money to be dropped off,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kidnapping, a common feature of Latin American gang activities and more recently in Russia, is often a reflection of a society in transition.  According to Mark Shaw of the Institute for Defence Policy, comparative social conditions exist between these countries and South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are a society in transition with large disparities between rich and poor, where control structures like the police appear to have broken down and criminal organisations are stepping into the breach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three other South Africans have since been arrested and charged with another kidnapping following a successful police trap. Sergeant Nico Hand, the investigating officer, said they may have been involved in as many as three other cases.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The selection of Professor Sam Nolutshungu as the University of the Witwatersrand's new vice-chancellor may have grabbed the headlines in South Africa, but it passed by the United States university town of Rochester.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local newspaper had not heard of Nolutshungu, a political science professor at Rochester, never mind his sensational victory before the 28- member selection committee which has almost certainly landed him the top job at South Africa's most famous university. The only entry in its archives connected with the academic was that a child of his had been nominated a black scholar by the Urban League of Rochester, a town 400km from New York City with about 250 000 mostly white inhabitants.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rochester University's public relations office had not heard the news when approached. After Nolutshungu informed them he had not officially been appointed, the office decided it was inappropriate to arrange comment from students or colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nolutshungu said he felt the selection process for the post had been &quot;long, cumbersome and tiresome&quot;. He said such an excessive commitment to transparency was unlikely to have succeeded anywhere else. However, after having been through it, he supposed it was the correct approach to have taken.  &quot;It gave everyone a chance to be heard, and convinced all concerned that the selection process was done fairly.&quot; Nolutshungu and his two competitors delivered a speech in the university's great hall, and were then interviewed on closed-circuit television by the large selection committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nolutshungu, who was born in King William's Town and lived abroad for 31 years, said he had been surprised that so many South African commentators and newspapers had been so certain of the outcome of the selection considering the strength of all three candidates and the thorough selection process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was an admirer and supporter of the ANC, but that he would not necessarily toe the party's line on education policy. &quot;I will not be a representative of its politics.&quot; Asked about his political leanings in the United States, he said if he could vote there - he is a British citizen and recently regained his South African passport - he would &quot;probably not vote Republican&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was well aware of the difficulties facing Wits, which put it worlds apart from the quieter campus of Rochester. &quot;Maybe the task is beyond me, maybe I'll manage it.&quot; The two universities, Wits and Rochester differ vastly in size. The American college has just 6 800 students to Wits's 20 000.  He said it was crucial the university and commentators on its &quot; transformation&quot; stopped thinking permanently in &quot;crisis mode&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nolutshungu said he had been an active anti- apartheid campaigner while in exile and had written copiously on apartheid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - He was only five years old. A boy delighted with himself after finding his lost piggy bank. But when Yaaseen Ebrahim rushed out of his room rattling the precious red and black box, he ran straight into a gang of robbers busy throttling his grandmother inside their home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They stole his savings, strangled him with his mother's scarf, battered his tiny body to death with his own cricket bat, and and then smothered him in a duvet.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The brutal and senseless murder of this innocent child has stunned the predominantly Indian community of Lenasia, near Johannesburg, and left his Muslim parents, Ahmed and Soraya Ebrahim, struggling to come to terms with the death of their youngest son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family's domestic worker has been held and questioned by police after it was alleged that her boyfriend may have been one of the robbers-turned- killers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yaaseen's grandmother Juleikha Saleh, who was looking after him at the time, was also beaten up by the gang who pushed a knife under her tongue and threatened to cut off her hand to get her gold bandles. They fled with several pieces of gold jewellery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tragedy struck the Ebrahim family last Monday morning when the gang of two or three men entered the house through a door, which the family claims had been left open, and grabbed Saleh (65) from behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They beat the frail old lady's head against the hallway wall and gagged her with a towel she was carrying. Little Yaaseen, who was playing with his money box at the time, stumbled on to the scene and started screaming.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was dragged into a back bedroom and beaten to a pulp with the same bat he had used to play cricket with his older brothers. Tall for his age and with a gangly athleticism, it appears that Yaaseen fought desperately with his attackers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we saw him his tiny fists were shut in a tight ball as if he had put up a terrific struggle with the killer,'' said his mother. &quot;He was a brave boy and I know he would have tried to protect his gran.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heavily sedated and being comforted by a stream of relatives who, in accordance with Muslim tradition, will eat and pray for three days as they mourn Yaaseen's death, Soraya Ebrahim wept silently as she talked about the child she described as her favourite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was a lovely child, so loving and bright. I can't believe that he's gone - and in such a horrible way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He wanted to be a cricketer and he was very good at it ... he had his whole life in front of him and those animals have robbed us of a chance to see him grow into a man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What has particularly devastated the couple is that the death was so barbaric and cold- blooded. &quot;He was just a child. They could have just locked him in the bathroom, or even knocked him out,&quot; she cried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her husband, eyes red and puffy from crying, explained that his mother only narrowly escaped being killed after the murderers were interrupted by a family member. &quot;It was about 9am and my brother Essop had come to visit our mother when he spotted the maid standing about a block away. She became hysterical and said gunmen were in the house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men, who only had knives, had already packed a large suitcase full of household goods. They had also moved the TV and video as if to transport them from the house, when the brother drove up and honked the hooter of his van.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He took up the story: &quot;The neighbours came running immediately and there were some workmen next door who could also have been alerted if someone had just screamed for help,&quot; he said. Three of the houses across the road are inhabited by family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end it was the maid who went into the house and emerged carrying the limp body of the child in her arms. The men escaped by jumping over the back wall. &quot;There appeared to be a faint pulse and we rushed Yaaseen to doctor Goolan Moosa down the street, but his wife refused to let us in because she said the surgery was closed,&quot; complained Essop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moosa, who has worked in the area for more than 20 years, says he was in the bath and did not hear the commotion. &quot;It was my wife who turned them away and I have given her a good scolding. Although I am sorry that that happened it would appear that the child was already dead by then.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The family, however, believe it might have been possible to revive Yaassen if he had been afforded quick medical assistance and plan to protest outside his house this weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As far as I'm concerned the doctor should be struck off for neglecting his duty and the murderers given the same sentence they gave my son,&quot; said Ahmed as he called for a revival of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Callous people like those who killed my son should not be protected by the law. They represent a lawless element in our society which should be stamped out before they can destroy anymore lives. Today it's my son, but tomorrow it could be your child whose life is squeezed out of him.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Two former intelligence agents - a man and his wife - who were fired after refusing to take a prescribed oath of loyalty to the 1994 transitional authority, are suing the government for more than a million rands for unfair dismissal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Papers have been filed in the Pretoria Supreme Court by Susan and Pieter Pretorius, but a court date is yet to be set.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither party will talk to the media, but Pretorius has mandated Freedom Front MP Pieter Groenewald to talk on his behalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Groenewald said this week that Pretorius's problems started in early 1994, when he was reluctant to take a prescribed oath of loyalty required by the Transitional Executive Council (TEC), just before the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The TEC insisted on this measure to ensure stability in the run-up to and during the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Groenewald said Pretorius had sought outside advice on the ethics of the oath, but in doing so, had provoked the censure of his authorities and was suspended without a disciplinary hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His relationship with the authorities subsequently deteriorated, and eventually both he and his wife were forced to leave the service in 1994, following alleged intimidation by security operatives, including the bugging of telephone conversations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pretorius claimed that there was never an official disciplinary hearing to investigate the charges against him. He is suing for unfair dismissal, loss of income and future earnings, personal suffering as well as damage sustained to his family life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Groenewald said he had offered his services to the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) as an arbitrator in this dispute, but the department had turned his offer down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An NIA spokesman confirmed that a summons had been issued against the government by the Pretorius', but said he was not in a position to comment because the matter was sub judice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Minister of Public Service, Zola Skweyiya, acknowledged this week he was in trouble. At a meeting held behind closed doors in Parliament, he bluntly sketched the serious problems undermining transformation in the public service and appealed to parliamentarians, officials and international development experts for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is expected that the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee will, as a result of the meeting, start to play a more active role in monitoring the public service, and putting pressure on wayward departments to tighten their belts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a range of sources, Skweyiya admitted that the rationalisation of government departments had been too slow at best, and non-existent at worst. He reportedly said provincial departments had not rationalised at all, despite frequent promises to do so. He singled out the departments of Health, Education, Labour and Home Affairs as those which had been making an effort to cut down on costs and numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He reportedly also told the group that the government's right-sizing programme - which aimed to cut down the number of unnecessary posts in the public service - was severely undermining expertise in the public service, and resulting in a haemorrhaging of essential skills. These skills were necessary to get the troubled administrations of provinces back on their feet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also spoke of the waste of money through the payment of &quot;ghost&quot; workers, which he said was a larger problem than acknowledged by authorities. He said that more than a billion rand was being spent on ghosts' salaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skweyiya's difficulties will be further compounded by negotiations in the Public Service Bargaining Chamber which start in Cape Town on Monday. It has been rumoured that an agreement signed between the unions and the government this year - in which unions secured higher wages for their members in coming years following the abolition of government posts - may have to be revisited because of a failure to abolish enough posts in time. It is said that only 15 000 of the intended 40 000 have been abolished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was sharply denied yesterday by Skweyiya's representative, Thandeke Gqubule, who said the government was committed to paying public servants' salary increases and there was no link between the success of the voluntary retrenchment programme and the payment of salaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should this be the case, it is expected that tensions between Skweyiya and Minister of Finance Trevor Manuel will rise in Cabinet as the public service fails to make the personnel cuts necessary to make the savings on the wage- bill demanded by the macro- economic plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week a report on administrative problems in the Eastern Cape was tabled in Cabinet, with recommendations on how to solve some problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skweyiya and the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee chairman, Salie Manie, say they will hold a media conference on Tuesday to announce a plan of remedial action to fix the Public Service's problems. They will also announce their intention to stage a major conference early next year to discuss the problems inhibiting the delivery of government services.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Even before Beau Brummell's nudist resort went bankrupt the International Naturist Federation had expelled him from their ranks. They say he is a pornographer. And his wife agrees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After 18 years of letting it all hang out, nudist king and porno-dealer Beau Brummell (his real name is Michael Bush) has put his clothes back on.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 54-year-old Brummell, who has fought a bitter three-year court battle with shareholders, who also accuse him of dealing in pornography, is getting out of the business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a sad day. Nudity has been my business all my life and I was damn good at it. But I can't take the stress and the worry any more. This is no longer fun, so I'm moving on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claims the shareholders have fleeced him because they were opposed to homosexuals and blacks joining in the activities at the colony near Warmbaths, north of Pretoria. But others say Brummell was peddling low-grade porn. And the Antwerp-based International Naturist Federation left him in the cold after expelling his South African Naturist Federation because of &quot;definitely proved pornographic activities&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even his wife, Cecilia, says they were into porn for the last eight years: &quot; How do they (shareholders) think we kept the naturist colony going? We are proud of who we are ... the majority of my shareholders bought porn from us.  Unlike them, our lives have always been an open book, we have no skeletons in the cupboard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brummell's ventures into pornography included marketing still photographs and movies, and distributing cheaply produced pamphlets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brummell successfully opposed three previous court actions against the closure of the colony by the 65 shareholders. In addition to charges of pornography, they also accused him of not consulting them and of unilaterally increasing monthly levies from R140 to R720 in less than a year. Brummell says he did not need to consult because of his 80% stake in the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, his decision to shut down was effectively forced by a three-year levy boycott by shareholders. Brummell says the shareholders now owe him the R1,3-million which it cost him to maintain the colony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two shareholders, who declined to be named, say Brummell indecently exploited the spirit of naturism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We didn't want to be associated with a person who peddles pornography. He has done so many things which are against naturism,&quot; a board member said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another says: &quot;He (Brummell) came up with this unbelievably autocratic decision that gays are welcome. I wouldn't want my children to mingle with them. Moreover, when we formed the company in 1992 we agreed the resort would only be for families and heterosexual couples.&quot; The shareholders deny they resisted blacks visiting the resort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brummell admits that the 1993 open-door policy never proved profitable as only one black couple ever come to the colony. He added that no homosexuals visited the colony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 400ha Beau Valley greets visitors with a signboard that reads, &quot;Welcome to the Sunshine State ... NATURALLY&quot;. It is here that we found up to 50 unclad weekend visitors relaxing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None seemed bothered by the (clothed) M&amp;G reporter and photographer. They had no idea that within days Beau Valley will be no more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Application to liquidate Nylbuffel Share Block, the company that ran the colony, was issued by the Pretoria Supreme Court on Tuesday. Brummell says an auctioneer will sell off the Beau Valley in the next two months.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A petite 21-year-old Stellenbosch University student says she has been repeatedly heckled, abused and imtimidated by fellow residence students because she refuses to pray after meals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers' letters are flying between the student, Yvonne Malan, and student leaders of the Harmonie residence after a botched attempt to outlaw her from the dining-room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malan, now in her third year, told the Mail &amp; Guardian this week that the intimidation was part of a history of conflict which dated back to her first year when she resisted the doop (initiation) activities, and also presented different viewpoints from the norm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apart from Wilgenhof, this is the oldest residence in Stellenbosch and it is very strong on tradition. Nobody speaks against it, and it's mostly filled with third- generation students, people whose grandmothers were at the res.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In first year, they hung up the National Party flag and I objected and I got hammered ... the day before the general elections they made everybody sing Die Stem. I refused and by the time I got to my room, the mob was already there waiting ... they also try and keep me awake at night by banging on my door at 3am ... it's mostly a psychological thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malan, who is majoring in philosophy and politics, has a coloured boyfriend and she says this causes her further problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A girl came to me and said I must remember that 'mossies word met mossies en spreeus word by spreeus' (birds of a feather flock together),&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malan said the residence was unofficially separated into white and coloured students, with the race groups sitting at different tables in the dining-room, and engaging in different activities. She said the white students referred to coloured people as &quot;daardie mense (those people)&quot; and that their rights counted for nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malan said that she often ended up eating in the dining-room on her own because she was considered persona non grata by her white counterparts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she left the dining-room after meals without waiting for prayers to be completed. The row concerning this has been simmering since September when students at a house meeting, which she was did not attend, discussed her behaviour and reportedly passed a motion to outlaw her from the dining-room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She could not find documentary evidence about this, but wrote to the house committee asking for an explanation of her rights. She received a letter from a lawyer which said that her rights as an individual were subject to the rights of the majority, which were Christian, and asserting that the residence was private property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She took legal advice and responded that there were no grounds for this argument. She also objected to the tone in which the letter had been written.  Another lawyer's letter followed, from the house committee, apologising for the tone, but saying that there would be no further trouble if she behaved herself. Her lawyer is drafting a response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The primaria (head student) of the residence, Jorisna Bonthuys, said that the matter was an internal one, and that it had been dealt with. She said there were no grounds for the allegations of intimidation, and referred the M&amp;G to the dean for Student Affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A representative for Student Affairs, Danie Roux, said: &quot;The whole matter sounds very funny, and it is strange that we have not heard anything about it.  I am afraid we cannot comment without knowing the specifics of the case, so perhaps you could encourage the student to come to us and we could help.&quot; Roux denied that there were such problems on campus, or that racism in residences was an issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malan said she had not gone to the authorities to complain because everybody would close ranks and deny any wrongdoing, and because the authorities' first loyalties were always to the residences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They will say that I am throwing the Afrikaner tradition down the drain,&quot; she said. &quot;Those with problems are too frightened to speak when it comes to the crunch, because you are not just fighting the administration, but also the National Party in the Western Cape, the Studentekerk and a faction of the Broederbond.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of the Students' Representative Council (SRC), Nadine Fourie, said she had not heard of the matter but intended to follow it up. &quot;We would strongly condemn and take strong steps against discrimination because we support the principle of religious freedom. I have heard that the rule of obligatory prayer has recently been scrapped by the house committee, but it's clear that not all parties are happy, so we will definitely follow this up and try for an amicable solution. There seem to be a lot of communication gaps at the moment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourie said that intimidation of the sort described by the student was unacceptable, but was cautious about commenting without knowing the full details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to understand that we are moving to a situation where different people of different cultures and beliefs will be living together on campus.  Our res tradition is important, it is an integral part of Stellenbosch culture, but that culture must be one of tolerance and there must be an exchange of cultures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The disproportionally small number of black students to white students makes it very difficult to integrate on a social level, and this will have to be addressed by the SRC and the university.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister of education's special advisor, Thami Mseleku, said the house committee's stance on prayer was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All these matters are of great concern to the minister and the Commission for Higher Education and we are reviewing similar reports from Potchefstroom University where Muslim students are being expected to do certain actions and take certain courses which are contrary to their religion.&quot; Mseleku said Stellenbosch students had raised the issue of racism in residences and on campus with him when he visited the campus last year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Deputy President Thabo Mbeki comes in for a scathing attack in Bantu Holomisa's court challenge against his expulsion from the African National Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa says in his affidavit served on the African National Congress this week that he had cleared his Truth and Reconciliation Commission submission with President Nelson Mandela, who &quot;encouraged me to place the material I had before the TRC&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth submission was the start of his problems in the ANC as it implicated his Cabinet colleague Stella Sigcau in benefiting from Sol Kerzner's alleged gambling rights bribe in the former Transkei.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Holomisa: &quot;When I gave evidence I gave it in the confident belief that it had been approved of by my colleagues in the ANC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbeki contacted Holomisa after learning from the media that he had &quot; attacked Sigcau&quot;. Holomisa told him &quot;the media was making a mountain out of a molehill&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa continues that Mbeki made &quot;no suggestion that I had acted incorrectly&quot;, but that he would mediate between him and Sigcau. Then Mbeki came out claiming the Alexander Commission and courts had cleared Sigcau.  Holomisa says that commission had merely confirmed what he (Holomisa) later told the TRC - and that Mbeki's comments &quot;had the effect of wholly misrepresenting the position&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Bantu Holomisa, gearing up for a bruising and expensive court battle to be reinstated as an African National Congress member, this week asked President Nelson Mandela to give him his Transkei military pension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa's lawyers served papers on the ANC and filed them with the Rand Supreme Court on Thursday, demanding that the axed deputy minister be reinstated with &quot;full rights and privileges&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyers will argue that these rights include Holomisa's seat in Parliament, which he had to vacate after losing his ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) appeal in September.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court action, which names Minister of Public Service Zola Skweyiya, ANC national chair Jacob Zuma and the ANC itself as respondents, argues that the ANC had been &quot;fatally biased&quot; in its decision to expel him. Zuma chaired the NEC meeting, while Skweyiya was chair of the ANC disciplinary hearing that made the original decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC has 15 court days to respond, failing which the matter will be set down for hearing on December 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa's attorney, Gordon Aarons of Shapiro Aarons, confirmed this week that the papers, a bulky 86 pages of affidavit, had taken a team of three lawyers, including a senior counsel, &quot;several weeks&quot; of solid work to prepare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa, unemployed since the loss of his seat in Parliament, will have a staggering legal bill to meet. He told the Mail &amp; Guardian the cost of preparing the papers alone could be as much as R150 000. Should the matter go to court, as is likely, the legal bill could run into hundreds of thousands more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa said he was in the process of raising money - and has had offers from &quot;sympathisers who include ANC members&quot; to start collecting. But Holomisa told them &quot;no one should be collecting money in my name unless a fund is properly constituted&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Holomisa confirmed he had appealed to Mandela in Cape Town this week to remove impediments so that his Transkei military pension, which he believes he has been entitled to since 1994, can be paid out. Holomisa said the pension would be worth over R200 000 in back pay, as well as R7 000 per month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa, at the time military ruler of the Transkei, resigned as chief of the Transkei Defence Force in early 1994 when the ANC asked him to make himself available as an ANC election candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa said he applied for early retirement in terms of the Transkei Defence Act, which he believes qualified him for the pension. But, he added, the new Eastern Cape government balked at paying in mid-1994, and he appealed to Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The president was sympathetic from the word go. He said former homeland leaders and (former president FW) de Klerk was getting that, so Holomisa should also get it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa said nothing came of it after Mandela referred the matter to Minister of Defence Joe Modise. He appealed to Mandela again this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela's legal advisor, Nicholas Haysom, confirmed Holomisa saw Mandela &quot; to see whether there isn't a way for him to get the pension&quot;. He said Mandela was sympathetic &quot;provided there is a legal way&quot;, but that he was awaiting reports from the departments of Defence and Finance on the legality of the pay-out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Supreme Court, in a similar case, interpreted the Transkei Defence Act as saying voluntary retirement with pension benefits was &quot;permissible only within certain periods&quot;. In terms of that decision Holomisa did not qualify, Haysom said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In the space of a few months the University of the Witwatersrand has, against all expectation, picked up its scattered pieces and moulded a fragile new unity for itself. Last Sunday the selection committee picked Sam Nolutshungu to lead the institution into the 20th century. Exactly a year ago - also the last Sunday in October - Sunday newspapers revealed how 13 academics had moved to unseat then heir-apparent William Makgoba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their action set off the rapid unravelling of one of South Africa's premier universities. A seemingly endless cycle of witch-hunts, threatened resignations, student protests and stormy midnight meetings polarised Wits into an increasingly miserable example of &quot;transitional disaster&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One academic embroiled in the &quot;Makgoba saga&quot; committed suicide, two suffered severe heart problems and two others resigned. Whether the vicious fights triggered these events is unknown, but clearly the stress took its toll on the entire institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, for the first time in a long period, academics, students and staff are walking with a new spring in their step, singing the same praise song for the man who will most likely be the university's new leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senate and Council must still ratify the selection committee's 61% majority decision for Nolutshungu to take the helm: of 28 votes, 17 went to him, 10 to Deputy Vice- Chancellor June Sinclair and one to University of the North Vice-Chancellor Njabulo Ndebele. But his appointment appears to be a near-fait accompli, with a vote against this unprecedented celebration of unity between staff and students looking unlikely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The whole process has been steeped in irony: six of the academics who moved to oust Makgoba last year were on this week's selection committee; the &quot; progressive alliance&quot; who had wooed a reluctant Ndebele to enter the race then overlooked him; and a rank outsider with slightly Africanist leanings won the day - despite the disastrous consequences of the appointment of another politically threatening &quot;outsider&quot; (in Makgoba) still fresh in the minds of most.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What looked set to be a clear fight between the other two candidates, Sinclair and Ndebele, turned out to be nothing of the sort. With his outstanding public address and solid handling of the questions pitched at him, Nolutshungu literally stole the show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He shone; he lit up the room,&quot; said an academic close to the selection process. &quot;People were excited and exuberant and motivated for the first time - they bounced in the corridors after hearing him speak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With his conventional concept of academic freedom, his political independence and clear sense of how a university should operate and his obvious commitment to transparency and inclusivity, he managed to unify all the sectors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nolutshungu, who studied at Fort Hare and then spent his academic career in the United States, Canada, Britain and Nigeria, was labelled an &quot;outsider&quot; from the start and did not get much attention. But he is a respected political scientist who has made significant contributions to understanding South Africa's apartheid-era foreign policy and is involved in a key think- tank of African intellectuals, the Council for Development of Economic and Social Research in Africa, examining the continent's problematic transition to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His &quot;suss&quot; became apparent to all who listened to him. He is steeped in the politics of the place yet his hands are free from the baggage of parochial in- fighting. This, and his respect for academic autonomy and commitment to ensuring Wits as a centre of excellence, won over the &quot;middle ground&quot; academics alienated by Ndebele's discourse on higher education transformation which tended to subjugate the interests of Wits to the broader goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the &quot;progressive alliance&quot; of academics, students and workers on the committee who intended voting for Ndebele saw this, they changed tack and decided to put their weight behind Nolutshungu rather than cause a split vote between Nolutshungu and Ndebele and risk a victory for Sinclair. Those who had wooed Ndebele buried their political inclinations and opted for pragmatism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Nolutshungu lacks in administrative experience he makes up for in charisma and leadership abilities - qualities perhaps more crucial in navigating a path through the choppy waters of transition. &quot;Nolutshungu is clearly a man who can learn things very quickly. He is sharp and shrewd,&quot; said another source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An academic close to Anne Letsebi, a member of the selection committee and of Thabo Mbeki's kitchen cabinet, scotched a report that she had orchestrated the Nolutshungu lobby and in the end pushed an African National Congress agenda. &quot;She worked as a team-worker with others in the progressive alliance,&quot; said the source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndebele's downfall, it seems, was his beholden stance to the ANC's vision for higher education, despite his reputation for political independence.  Clearly, he was the ANC's choice and had the backing of President Nelson Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the &quot;middle ground&quot; academics saw this as a possible threat to academic autonomy. And his transformation talk, albeit sincere, &quot;was solid but fundamentally threatening to Wits&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, Ndebele is not a man who plays to an audience. In a highly transparent process where public performance counted a great deal, he was &quot; naked&quot;, as one academic put it; his performance was lacklustre. Those who backed him for his leadership calibre and his ideas, chose Nolutshungu instead to save the institution from Sinclair. &quot;It was about keeping Sinclair out,&quot; said another academic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sinclair, who has impressive administrative experience, is regarded, however, as having an adversarial management style. &quot;There would have been trouble if she was appointed and the academics knew it,&quot; commented a senior academic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others were not impressed with her &quot;trendy management theory of re- engineering the university and gearing it towards the market&quot;, said sociologist Glen Adler. One member of the public asked if she planned to turn the university into a &quot;spaza shop&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Nolutshungu gets the job, Sinclair's future is uncertain. Her term of office expires at the end of the year and rumours abound that she is tipped to lead Crawford College's proposed university venture. She was not available for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outgoing vice-chancellor Robert Charlton, who retires at the end of next year, described the process so far as &quot;taking transparency and democracy all the way - a great plus for the university&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICRC has taken all necessary measures with a view to resuming its activities in Kivu, on the basis of its mandate under the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol I, so that the victims can receive the protection and assistance to which they are entitled.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - Three human rights activists in the Zairian capital, Kinshasa, are reported to have been arrested in recent days by the Zairian authorities because they were inquiring about human rights abuses against members of the Tutsi ethnic group. One of the activists, Floribert Chebeya Bahizire, is the President of a human rights group La voix des sans voix (VSV), Voice of the Voiceless. Amnesty International has not been able to establish their place of detention, and fears that they may be ill-treated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International has also learned that an unspecified number of Tutsi families have been removed from their homes and are being held in Kinshasa by members of the Zairian security forces. It has been reported that the Zairian authorities intend to expel the families from Zaire on the grounds that they are not Zairian nationals. It is feared that these Tutsi and other Tutsi living in Zaire may be subjected to human rights violations, including extrajudicial executions, &quot;disappearance&quot;, torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is growing hostility and violence against members of the Tutsi ethnic group, and to a lesser extent those of the Hutu ethnic group, since fighting began in eastern Zaire in September 1996 between Tutsi known as Banyamulenge and Zairian armed forces. The hostility on the part of the Zairian authorities and sectors of the civilian population is also extended to anyone suspected of sympathizing with the Tutsi. Hundreds of Tutsi have already been deported by the Zairian authorities to Rwanda and Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banyamulenge claim that they are fighting for their right to Zairian nationality which they have been denied by the Zairian authorities.  Banyamulenge have already captured several towns in eastern Zaire's North and South-Kivu regions. The Zairian authorities have accused Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda of supporting the Banyamulenge armed group, a claim denied by the governments of those countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been reported that on 31 October 1996, the Zairian parliament overwhelmingly voted to demand that Zaire severs diplomatic relations with Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda. The parliament also demanded the removal of Tutsi from government jobs, including the security forces. Many Tutsi have already fled the country fearing for their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RECOMMENDED ACTION: Please send telegrams/faxes/express/airmail letters in French or your own language:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- expressing concern at the arrest of Floribert Chebeya Bahizire, Harouna Mbongo and Bashi Nabukili, simply because they inquired about human rights abuses against Tutsi;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- expressing concern at the removal of Tutsi from their homes in Kinshasa and the threat to expel them from Zaire;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- pointing out that the human rights activists and members of the Tutsi families who have been arrested are prisoners of conscience and demanding their immediate and unconditional release;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - Amnesty International today strongly condemned the recent abduction of schoolgirls by the northern Ugandan armed opposition Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and called on the group to immediately release all captives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirty schoolgirls abducted on 9 October from St. Mary's College in Aboke are reported to be among scores of captives in the hands of the LRA, despite military intervention by the army, the Ugandan People's Defence Force (UPDF).  The raid on the school continues the pattern of LRA deliberate assaults on civilians which have intensified over the past three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The abduction of the girls from Aboke is the latest in a series of attacks on schools by the LRA and demonstrates yet again that the rebels are blatant in their disregard for the human rights of the very people on whose behalf they claim to be fighting,&quot; Amnesty International said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the massacre of 115 Sudanese refugees at Achol- Pii in July, LRA troops have been responsible for scores of other deliberate killings and hundreds of abductions, often of schoolchildren. Many captives are tortured and those who try to escape risk being shot. Abducted girls are at risk of rape. Children are forcibly recruited into the LRA's ranks or are used to carry equipment and looted property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LRA has bases in Sudan and is reportedly supported by the Sudan Government. The LRA troops holding the girls taken captive are reported to have crossed the Sudan border. Amnesty International is calling on the Sudanese authorities to take action to ensure that captives are freed and returned safely to Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the UPDF have often stepped in to free rebel captives, their own responsibility for human rights abuses is helping fuel the violence in northern Uganda. On 16 August two of the most senior army officers in Gulu town threw four alleged LRA members to a lynch mob. After one man was killed, the soldiers drove to the main barracks, picked out a seriously wounded rebel suspect, drove to another part of Gulu and threw him and the two others to the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The army has exonerated the officers concerned, who remain at their posts, claiming that they were overpowered. However, as yet there has been no genuine impartial judicial inquiry charged with establishing the facts and recommending appropriate action. Amnesty International's information -- which comes from a wide variety of independent sources -- contradicts the army's version of events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of those murdered was a young man taken captive by the LRA only the day before. His parents are reported to be seeking compensation from the army.  Another was a tailor with no known connection with the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is difficult to understand how the authorities believe that local people can have confidence in the armed forces if soldiers, especially senior officers, are allowed to murder with impunity,&quot; Amnesty International said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However severe the abuses of the LRA, nothing excuses violations by the UPDF or failure by the authorities to take decisive action to prevent or properly investigate UPDF violations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International is calling for a judicial inquiry into the killings on 16 August and the army's response. As an interim measure, the worldwide human rights organization is calling on the parliamentary Defence and Internal Affairs Committee investigating the causes of the insurgency to take a detailed look at the Gulu incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalists and human rights activists have on occasion been threatened by both the LRA and members of the armed forces. Amnesty International is also calling on the Ugandan authorities to ensure that journalists and human rights activists working in the north are able to carry out their work in a responsible and professional manner without curbs on their freedom of expression.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations - The Security Council has said that it was gravely concerned at the deteriorating situation in the Great Lakes region, in, particular eastern Zaire, and at the effect which the continued fighting was having on the inhabitants of that region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a Presidential statement on Friday, the Council President, Ambassador Nugroho Wisnumurti of Indonesia said the Council underlined the urgent need for a comprehensive and coordinated response by the international community to prevent any further escalation of the crisis in the region, adding that the Council called for an immediate cease-fire and a complete cessation of all fighting in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling on all States to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of neighbouring States in accordance with their obligations under the UN Charter, the Council urged all parties to refrain from the use of force as well as cross-border incursions and to engage in a process of negotiation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Council said it agreed with the Secretary-General that the situation in eastern Zaire constituted a serious threat to the stability of the Great Lakes region. &quot;It is convinced that the complex problems at issue can only be resolved through early and substantive dialogue. The Council urges the Governments of the region to pursue such a dialogue without further delay in order to defuse the tension,&quot; the President of the Council said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reiterating that the present situation in eastern Zaire underlined the need to organise a conference on peace, security and development in the Great Lakes region under the auspices of the UN and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), the Council called on the Secretary-General to ask his Special Envoy to promote the convening and to encourage the adequate preparation of such a conference on an urgent basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TEXT OF SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Security Council is gravely concerned at the deteriorating situation in the Great Lakes region, in particular eastern Zaire, and at the effect which the continued fighting is having on the inhabitants of the region and condemns all acts of violence. It underlines the urgent need for a comprehensive and coordinated response by the international community to prevent any further escalation of the crisis there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Security Council calls for an immediate cease-fire and a complete cessation of all fighting in the region. The council calls on all States to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of neighboring States in accordance with their obligations under the United Nations charter. In this connection, it urges all parties to refrain from the use of force as well as cross-border incursions and to engage in a process of negotiation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Security Council, in the light of the letters of the Secretary General to the President of the Council (S/1996/875 and S/1996/878), and the information received from the High Commissioner for Refugees, and the Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights regarding the situation in eastern Zaire, is particularly concerned at the humanitarian situation and the resulting large-scale movements of refugees and displaced persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It fully supports the efforts of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and humanitarian agencies to alleviate the suffering. It calls on all parties in the region to allow humanitarian agencies and non-governmental organizations to deliver humanitarian assistance to those in need and to ensure the safety of all refugees as well as the security and freedom of movement of all international humanitarian personnel. It underlines the urgent need for the orderly voluntary repatriation and resettlement of refugees, and the return of displaced persons, which are crucial elements for the stability of the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Security Council agrees with the Secretary-General that the situation in eastern Zaire constitutes a serious threat to the stability of the Great Lakes region. It is convinced that the complex problems at issue can only be resolved through early and substantive dialogue. The Council urges the governments of the region to pursue such a dialogue without further delay in order to defuse the tension. The Council calls upon all states in the region to create the conditions necessary for the speedy and peaceful resolution of the conflict, and to desist from any acts that may further exacerbate the situation. In this context, the Council welcomes all regional efforts aimed at defusing tension in the region, in particular the announcement of the meeting of regional leaders scheduled for 5 November 1996 in Nairobi, Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Security Council fully supports the initiative of the secretary-General to dispatch to the Great Lakes region a Special Envoy to consult with all concerned in order to establish the facts relating to the present conflict; to develop as a matter of urgency a plan to defuse tension and establish a cease-fire; to promote a process of negotiation; and to submit advice on the mandate to be given to a United Nations Special Representative, including on the size and structure of a United Nations political presence which, in consultation with the governments and parties concerned, will he established in the Great Lakes region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Council also considers that the Special Envoy should he provided with adequate staff and logistic resources in order to carry out his mission. The Council also expresses the hope that the mediation efforts of the Organization of African Unity and the European Union will complement those of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Council calls upon all governments and parties concerned to cooperate fully with the mission of the Special Envoy, and to contribute to the search for a comprehensive solution to the problems facing the people of the Great Lakes region. Given the urgency of the situation, the Council expresses the hope that the Special Envoy will travel as soon as possible to the region and provide early information on the situation there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Security Council reiterates that the present situation in eastern Zaire underlines the need to organize a conference on peace, security and development in the Great Lakes region under the auspices of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity. To this end, it calls on the Secretary-General to ask his Special Envoy to promote the convening and to encourage the adequate preparation of such a conference on an urgent basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Vice President Godfrey Miyanda was among hundreds of Lusaka residents who walked in the scorching heat in order to raise money for cash strapped national soccer team which is about to engage in major Africa and World cup series.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Heavy fighting continued in and around Goma, easing late afternoon with persistent press reports that Rwandan troops have entered the town in support of rebel forces and in response to Zairean shelling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rwanda Foreign Minister did not challenge allegations of a Rwandan incursion during an interview this evening. The BBC reported late Saturday afternoon that there were indications that the most of Goma had fallen to Tutsi rebels and that Zairean troops had fled the town. 108 aid workers and 11 foreign journalists were evacuated by road to the Rwandan border town of Gisenyi and were granted transit status by Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They should arrive in Nairobi on a WFP chartered Hercules today (Saturday).  Local Zairean aid workers did not join the evacuation, and had continued limited relief activities on Friday. In terms of the looming humanitarian crisis - which has been described as &quot;apocolyptic&quot; - Goma is critical, holding the largest concentration of Rwandan refugees (estimated by the UNHCR at 717,000).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zairean armed forces Chief of Staff Eluki Monga Aundu criticized the central government for not giving his troops the means to fight the on-going war. He added that his troops would continue to fight and would not stop at the Rwandan border but would continue beyond in a counter-offensive. He also claimed that Bukavu and Goma airports were still in Zairean army control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting has dispersed most of the refugees on the &quot;northern axis&quot; of Goma.  There were more reports today that Katale camp (202,000 Rwanda refugees) had dispersed. This has not been officially confirmed by UNHCR. Territorial gains by the rebels now include most of the border between Zaire, Rwanda and Burundi, and a border post on the Ugandan frontier. Far to the south, PANA reports the arrival by boat of 1,000 refugees in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda's ambassador to Zaire, Antoine Nyilinkindi, resigned Saturday, saying he disagreed with his government's position regarding Zaire, adding that Zaire was a victim of Rwanda's aggression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President of the UN General Assembly, Razali Ismail (Malaysia) issued a statement rebuking the international community for its impotence in the regional crisis, saying he felt guilt at the &quot;feeble&quot; response. He said the United Nations &quot;should be in mourning&quot; not only for the &quot;enormous human catastrophe&quot; unfolding in the Great Lakes but also for the &quot;evaporation of the international community's ability to respond effectively&quot;. Other critical reactions included British aid agency Oxfam which said (Friday) that the regional crisis was more than a humanitarian disaster - &quot;it is the tearing up of the Geneva Convention&quot; - and that refugees and the displaced were being denied protection by the international community as well as the warring parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday, the Security Council called for a ceasefire and an end to &quot;trans- border incursions&quot; saying they were &quot;a serious threat to the stability of the Great Lakes region&quot;. The statement made no reference to international military intervention, but supported a UN political presence. Those calling for foreign intervention now appear to include South Africa, voiced by Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo (Friday) - &quot;it is no doubt our unanimous view that the international community must take urgent measures, through the UN and regional organisations, to ensure peace and calm is restored&quot;. Moreover, South Africa is &quot;reviewing&quot; an $18 million arms deal with Rwanda due to the current crisis, according to Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said on Friday that the UN &quot;is in the lead politically and from the humanitarian point of view&quot;, but said a State Department offical would visit the region next week. He said that the US is &quot;working very cooperatively with France&quot; for a regional African conference. European Union ministers have been invited to meet in Brussels next Thursday to discuss emergency humanitarian support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN Special Mediator Raymond Chretien's trip to the region will not take place until after US presidential elections (November 5) - he is expected to arrive in Kinshasa on November 8 and Kigali November 11, having said his first priority is to arrange a ceasefire. Chretien told reporters he would also stop in Lausanne to see President Mobutu before leaving for the region.  According to the French daily Le Monde (Friday) Mobutu is unable to return to Zaire because of the effects of radiotherapy, and quoted medical aides saying that cancer had spread to his bones. This has not been officially confirmed by Lausanne's University Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are reports of increasing political discontent in Kinshasa - BBC reported looting of property belonging to Tutsis. Reuter reported several hundred protesters marching to Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo's offices and calling for his dismissal. Kengo (whom opposition groups are associating with the eastern Zairean crisis by virtue of his being part Tutsi) defended the Zairean army as having &quot;the means&quot; to defend the country and publicly complained of being made a &quot;scapegoat&quot;. Amnesty International has released a report expressing concern for human rights abuses against ethnic Tutsis in Kinshasa - reporting families removed from their homes by the Zairean security forces - and detailing the arrest of three human rights activists.  The report says there is growing violence against and forced deportations of those associated with the crisis in eastern Zaire - primarily ethnic Tutsis, but also ethnic Hutus, and other sympathisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tutsi rebels are fighting as part of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire, a political alliance of four opposition parties (Democratic Alliance of the People; Popular Revolutionary Pary; National Resistance Council for Democracy; Revolutionary Movement for the Liberation of Zaire). In a letter, attached to the ADFL (Congo-Zaire) manifesto, spokesman Laurent Kabila describes the party as &quot;an instrument of radical change&quot;. The ADFL declares there are &quot;no longer solid, stable or credible institutions in Zaire&quot; and says it decided &quot;to put an end to this state of affairs&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday the Zairean government said it had decided to deport Rwandan and Burundian refugees &quot;progessively and by force&quot;. In a statement issued after a cabinet meeting it declared it would not take part in any meeting on the crisis in eastern Zaire &quot;so long as the aggressor has not left Zairean soil&quot;.  Calls by the transitional parliament to sever diplomatic links with Uganda as well as with Rwanda and Burundi has widened the international dimensions of the conflict. Uganda denied any involvement today.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kafue - The Credit Union and Societies' Association (CUSA) Zambia is among other credit organisations in Africa elected to participate in the programme called Africa Revitalisation Programme (ARP) 2000 to design and develop policies, products and services to make them more competitive in the financial market and satisfy credit union members expectations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was disclosed in kafue yesterday by CUSA-Zambia acting managing director, Mr Robby Chilupula, when he opened the annual general meeting of the Nitrogen Chemicals of Zambia (NCZ) savings and credit union at social centre.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chilupula said NCZ credit union is one of the ten (10) credit organisations in Zambia out of 500 that had been chosen to pioneer the African revatilisation programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the programme activities to be undertaken include providing savings and deposit accounts savings withdrawals and shareholding accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile NCZ credit union members took their board members to task for allegedly helping themselves to large chunks of loans while shareholders receive peanuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They charged that despite the credit union share capital increasing from k54 million to k62 million in the last 12 months services to shareholders were shody promptimg several resignations by members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Board chairman, Mr Sylvester Kalunga parried the charges saying withdrawing shares was not the solution as this affected levels of investments. He said shareholders were at liberty through their supervisory committee to dictate to the board better ways of improving services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kalunga said the board was working out a programme to intensify member education and plans were underway to increase funding from 5 to 10 per cent of surplus funds to ensure the success of the programme.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Statement by the chairperson of the African National Congress of the North West Province: re the arrest of the ex-provincial accountant/bookkeeper of the African National Congress of the North West Province Mr J.P. (Hannes) Broodryk, 1 November 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following an internal investigation by the AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS of the North West Province and the South African Police Service (Commercial Branch) of Klerksdorp, warrants for the arrest of Mr J.P. (Hannes) Broodryk and for the search of his house have been implemented by members of the South African Police Service (Commercial Branch) at Klerksdorp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr J.P. (Hannes) Broodryk over the period during his employment as the Provincial Accountant/Bookkeeper of the African National Congress of the North West Province defrauded the African National Congress of hundreds of thousands of rands - including local government election money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr J.P. (Hannes) Broodryk during his employment made irregular and unauthorised use of AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS cheques and money - i.e.:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To buy two motor vehicles for himself amounting to R180 000-00 (one hundred and eighty thousand rand) both motor vehicles were recovered by the AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To buy worthless shares from a family members and transferred it in the name of the AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS of the North West Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To draw cash cheques to the amount of ten thousands of rands which are unaccounted for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To draw other cheques to the amount of hundreds of thousands of rands which are unaccounted for and of which a number of cheques already were traced back as cheques used by him to his own benefit, and.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To pay salaries to people irregularly and unauthorised employed by him at the AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS's Provincial Offices in Klerksdorp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr J.P. (Hannes) Broodryk shortly before his official suspension, alleged that he was attacked on his way from Mmabatho to Klerksdorp near Hartbeesfontein and that all the AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS of the North West Province's financial books and supporting documentation were taken by the attackers. This allegation by Mr J.P. (Hannes) Broodryk is completely devoid of all truth as the AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS of the North West Province and the South African Police Service (Commercial Branch) Klerksdorp are in possession of statements in support of the fact that no such attack has taken place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr J.P (Hannes) Broodryk after his final dismissal by the AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS of the North West Province irregularly and unauthorised used AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS cheques - money -i.e.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To purchase goods from a well-known retailer in Klerksdorp to his own benefit who even issued a company cheque to Mr. J.P. (Hannes) Broodryk as change on a AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS cheque; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To irregularly and unauthorised pay money into the bank account of his wife, Mrs C.F. Broodryk, to which nor he nor she was entitled to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. J.P (Hannes) Broodryk throughout his period of employment have failed to fulfil his duties and responsibilities as the Provincial Accountant/Bookkeeper for the AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS of the North West Province despite various demands by the Provincial Treasurer, Mrs M.  Modiselle, and the Secretary General, Mr N. Duma as well as the AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS Head Office in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presently an external audit is performed by a well-known and respected company in the North West Province as to determine the exact extend of the mal administration of the AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS of the North West Province's money by Mr J.P (Hannes) Broodryk during his time of employment.  This audit is expected to be completed shortly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As chairman of the AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS of the North West Province, I will take all steps necessary to ensure that all reasonable legal and other steps and processes are taken to criminally charge and civilly recover the AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS of the North West Province's money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The internal investigation and the investigation by the South African Police Service (Commercial Branch) of Klerksdorp continues and the press will be updated on the progress.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The ANC has taken note of the application for amnesty for the murder of ANC-SACP leader Chris Hani submitted to the Truth Commission by Janus Waluz and Clive-Derby Lewis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC reiterates its view that the prerogative of deciding on any application for amnesty resides within the jurisdiction of the Truth Commission.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC respects decisions of the Truth Commission within the confines of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, we wish to underline that at the trial it emerged that Clive-Derby- Lewis and Janus Waluz were motivated by factors completely extraneous to the peace process that was underway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, the two have never contended that they murdered Chris Hani in furtherance of any political objectives of any known political organisation.  As a matter of fact no political organisation associated itself with their actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition the murder of Chris Hani was completely disproportionate to any concerns Waluz and Derby-Lewis may have had against the ANC and its allies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is therefore our contention as an organisation that section 20 of the Truth Commission Act which defines acts with political objectives and sets out the prerequisites for granting amnesty, does not envisage the granting of amnesty to individuals such as these.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this regard, the ANC will support any efforts by the family of Chris Hani to oppose the application. We wish to reiterate, however, that the ANC and its allies will respect the determination made by the Truth Commission on this and other matters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The ANC welcomes the sentence handed down on former police officer Eugene De Kock by the Pretoria Supreme court. Although the sentence meted out cannot be a substitute for the valuable lives lost, it nonetheless fits the long list of crimes committed by the accused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC expresses its wish that the verdict and the sentence will serve as one of those historic deterrences against those who may now or in the future contemplate committing crimes against humanity. The ANC also hopes it will send a clear message to those who continue to commit crimes like murder, car- hijackings, rape and others.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the conviction of the ANC that those who conspired, aided and abetted the commission of such crimes as De Kock would themselves face the same fate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this regard, the National Party government bears the primary responsibility for acts committed in defence of the repugnant system of apartheid by the CCB, Vlakplaas Unit, Koevoet and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We insist that the activities of such units were not the work of rogue elements within the security establishment, but part of an overall strategy to undermine the ANC and the broad liberation movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now is the time for National Party leader FW De Klerk to come clean. in the spirit of reconciliation and peace, by taking the nation into his confidence and confess the sins of successive National Party governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We reiterate the call by families of many victims for full disclosure on all hitsquads activities and revelation of graves of those murdered and those who disappeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC calls on the Attorney's-General to follow up on details and clues provided by Eugene De Kock to ensure that all those implicated in similar heinous deeds including massacres, assassinations, train violence and the current taxi violence must be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - An Amnesty International delegation led by Secretary General Pierre Sane is in South Africa between 4 and 9 November 1996 to mark the first anniversary of the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and launch a worldwide campaign on human rights in Nigeria. The delegates will also be discussing Amnesty International's concerns about the current human rights situation in the Great Lakes region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the visit the delegates will meet representatives of the South African government, non- governmental organizations (NGOs) and religious communities. The South African government has been one of the most active African governments working for human rights improvements in Nigeria, and the South Africa-Nigeria Democracy Support Group (SANDSG) is an important NGO coalition network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation is in South Africa following prolonged but unsuccessful efforts to visit Nigeria itself. The Nigerian authorities have failed to respond to repeated requests for visas for the delegation. Amnesty International first wrote to the High Commissioner in London asking for a meeting regarding this visit in July 1996. In August it wrote to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. In September visa applications were submitted. No official response has been received to any of these approaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation, which was to have included Mme Danielle Mitterrand, had planned to meet Nigerian government officials, representatives of human rights organizations and other individuals. Amnesty International has throughout been willing to discuss with representatives of the Nigerian government its plans for the visit and remains willing to discuss arrangements for a future visit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington, DC - A million Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire are now without international protection and assistance as a result of the withdrawal of all humanitarian NGOs and UN agencies from Goma. Will the international community come to their aid in time to avert the deaths of tens of thousands?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, with the announcement by Tutsi rebels of a unilateral three-week cease-fire the international community may have its best opportunity to ensure that thousands of lives are not unnecessarily lost.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ideally, an international military force would secure humanitarian corridors in Zaire, but realistically this will not happen quickly. Meanwhile, what can be done is to organize a civilian operation along the Zaire-Rwanda border to deliver short-term emergency assistance and access for refugees to return to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To staff such an effort, the UNHCR should rely on a combination of its staff, volunteers drawn from humanitarian NGOs, Rwandan civil servants seconded from the ranks of border prefectures, and paid contract workers-- including former camp residents. Teams composed of individuals from the aforementioned groups could be posted at regular intervals along the route to provide emergency assistance, information, and, most of all, moral support to those heading home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assuming that the cease-fire holds, this plan could be implemented within days, and it will have to be, since by all accounts the supplies of food and water available to the displaced camp residents will last no longer than a week. The virtue of this plan is that it is quick, but it should not detract from efforts to organize and deploy an international security force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Persuading the refugees to return home will not be easy. Their leaders, who exercise a great deal of influence over refugee decision making, have long decreed that it is too dangerous to go home and that many will be arrested or killed. The voices of Hutu refugees who have returned home safely need to be heard. Perhaps a credible Hutu spokesperson will step forward to break the deadlock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, human rights abuses persist in Rwanda and immediate corrective measures should be taken. But the bottom line is that the only way for most refugees to avoid life-threatening peril will be to return home before disease, lack of food and fighting result in tens of thousands of deaths. For most refugees, repatriation is the best available choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some time, the international community has been pressing Rwanda to begin trials for those accused of human rights abuses and to relieve inhumane overcrowding in the prisons. In a good faith gesture, it would be especially helpful if Rwanda started civilian trials and military court proceedings for Rwandan military officials charged with human rights violations. Similarly, the international community should also insist that the international tribunal seated in Arusha begin trials immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If massive repatriation does occur, the Government of Rwanda will require more financial and humanitarian assistance. Though much reconstruction has taken place during the last two years, much more remains to be done to accommodate new returnees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - All uncollected voters' cards were today sent to 4,610 polling stations in the country, the chairman of the Electoral Commission Bobby Bwalya said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Bwalya, who was speaking today at a Patriotic Rescue Monitors (PAREMO) seminar in Lusaka said that all uncollected voters' cards have been sent to respective polling centres for collection by the owners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged all those who have lost their voters' cards to hastely collect voters' certificates from the elections office or polling stations so that they could participate in the November 18 elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Bwalya also revealed that the Electoral Commission had also instructed the national registration department to give national registration cards to those who have lost them so that they could participate in the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged the PAREMO monitors not to be corrupted and observe all corrupt and bribery acts which he said amount to a fine of K300,000 or imprisonment of three months or both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Justice Bwalya has warned all ministers against using state vehicles for campaign purposes because it was contrary to the just adopted electoral codes of conduct regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The electoral codes of conduct regulation, which becomes a statutory instrument tomorrow only allows the President to use state utilities for campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, the electoral codes of conducts also forbids campaigning on the polling day failure to which can lead to three months' imprisonment or fine of K300,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There will be no campaigns on the election day. The candidates from various political parties can only campaign up to November 17. The new electoral codes of conduct which was accepted by all political parties does not allow campaigning on the polling day,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clarifying further to the monitors on the events on the polling day, Justice Bwalya said it was not an offence to transport voters to polling stations as it would be easing their transport problems and also because the vote was secret.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged all Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) and monitoring teams in the country to work as partners with the electoral commission to achieve a goal of free and fair elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) today called on UNIP President, Kenneth Kaunda, to stop interfering with the November 18 general elections because he was not involved in the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZDC national coordinator, Enock Chola and Kafue constituency vice chairman, Langton Sichone who had travelled all the way from Kafue to Lusaka said that police must take immediate action against Dr Kaunda for collecting voters cards from the electorate if it was indeed an offence as alleged by the police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chola and Mr Sichone said the inspector general of police, Francis Ndhlovu should urgently deal with this case so that elections could be conducted in a free and fair atmosphere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are asking government to take action against Dr Kaunda to restrain him from conducting his exercise to grab the voters cards. Yesterday, in Kafue, he instructed his members to go flat out in grabbing the cards. We as ZDC dissociate ourselves from his action. We don't want to be used by Dr Kaunda&quot;, said Mr Sichone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Sichone said ZDC does not believe in violence but in the rule of law and urged all opposition parties taking part in the elections to work hand in hand so that the elections were conducted peacefully.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - The 12 Southern African Development Community (SADC) states, which recently suffered a drought-induced decline in food production, expect an upswing in the output of the staple maize crop, after favorable rains in most of the region in 1966.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crop production forecasts, published by the community's Food Security Regional Early Warning Unit in Harare, Zimbabwe, show that the region would this season record a combined 77 percent rise in maize production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unit anticipates that the region will in 1996 produce some 19.59 million tons of maize compared to 11.10 million tons harvested during the previous season. This is expected to meet the total regional consumption requirement of 19.25 million tons, including stock needs for the 1996/97 season.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the unit's March forecast, the region can also expect maize surplus in the 1996/97 marketing season. South Africa is expected to produce 3.36 million tons, and Zimbabwe 54,000 tons. Even Mozambique, emerging from years of war, is expected to produce some 48,000 tons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost all of the community countries had been affected by intermittent drought since their worst experience during the 1990/91 season. That drought forced many states to import food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To guard against future droughts, the region has embarked on an ambitious food security program. This establishes a regional food reserve and proposes a 30-million-U.S.-dollar loan fund for countries needing to import food during climatic disasters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These tasks are in addition to the unit's responsibility to provide information about the food situation in member-states, enabling food deficit countries to take appropriate steps to prevent cereal shortages and avoid famine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the unit plans to put in place food storage, distribution and other measures to ensure food availability to all its 180 million inhabitants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe there is no reason for anybody in this region or anywhere else for that matter to sleep hungry,&quot; said Kaire Mbuende, the SADC executive secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was illustrating how transportation and distribution difficulties caused some people to go without food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mbunde, adequate logistics had already been put in place to boost food production to meet regional demand. What was now necessary was to ensure that adequate supplies were quickly moved to deficit areas, including urban centers where an increasing number of people were getting hungry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a new trend of food insecurity even among our urban dwellers both due to unemployment and because not enough food is made available for all to afford,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SADC countries agree they need to expand irrigation to boost food production, in the wake of recurrent droughts in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other regional projects, intended to ensure more food is produced and security among SADC states, include the Harare-based Southern African Center for Cooperation in Agricultural Research and Training and the Regional Inventory of Agriculture Resource Base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The center, established in the 1980s, is involved in agricultural research and training of agricultural experts. It also awards research and travel grants to such specialists in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Regional Inventory and Agricultural Resource Base works at the national and regional levels. It is intended to provide background information for agricultural land use and other planning purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A SADC proposed blueprint, adopted several years ago, on the growth of agriculture and food security in the region during the next 20 years, has recommended that apart from research on the traditional cereal staples such as maize, more work be done on wheat, rice, potatoes and oilseeds. It says there is also need for further research on fruits, vegetables, dairy and poultry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It recommends increased use of the region's irrigation potential and more research on the response of various crops to fertilizers, as well as development of improved agricultural implements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the program, SADC farmers are also being advised by local and regional policy research institutes to adopt sustainable agricultural production methods involving successful management of the various natural resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SADC comprises Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Mexico castigated the United States Sunday for what it said were unfair unilateral actions with extraterritorial effects, and it urged the Group of 15 developing countries to counter that policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mexico has already passed a law of its own as an antidote to the unilateral actions taken by the United States of America and its discriminatory practices with Cuba which is affecting relations of other countries,&quot; Mexican Foreign Minister Jose Angle Gurria said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was speaking of the law passed recently by the United States on Cuba, which affects the trade relations of third countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His comment was to plenary on the first day of the G-15 summit in Harare, the Zimbabwe capital. Gurria is leading the Mexican delegation at the summit which is discussing the state of the current international trade relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He asked other G-15 member countries to consider adopting Mexico's measures to maintain its right to trade with Cuba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mexico, Canada and the United States have signed the North American Free Trade Agreement, known as NAFTA. Canada has also threatened action against the U.S. ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairing the plenary session, President Robert Mugabe said: &quot;We feel that it's wrong for a state to transfer its hatred of another country and make it affect its relationship with a third country and force countries with a relationship with Cuba to stop relating with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said G-15 countries would study the Mexican response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the same session Mugabe criticized the United States for refusing to endorse the second-term candidacy of the Egyptian, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, as the secretary-general of the United Nations. Mugabe also said such actions defeated the whole idea of democracy and respect for the sovereignty of other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The United States of America has always sought to impose its will on everybody else. They are passing this to us as a general attitude and we must resist,&quot; Mugabe said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The high court on Monday postponed indefinitely the treason trial of Zimbabwean opposition politician, Ndabaningi Sithole, after defence lawyers said they were not ready because the state had given them little time and information to prepare for trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sithole's lead attorney, Tendai Biti of Honey and Blanckenberg, made a plethora of applications when the trial was due citing the state's refusal to give the defence more information and sworn statements of the 16 witnesses to testify against sithole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among them are two members of the Zimbabwe National Army who allege that they were recruited and trained in Mozambique as bandits to fight the Zimbabwean government under Chimwenje, the rebel group allegedly led by Sithole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to know when those persons joined the army,&quot; Biti told Justice James Robertson Devittie, sitting with assessors Nicholas Puwai and Major Misheck Nyandoro.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biti also said the defence wanted transcripts of last year's trials of two Chimwenje operatives, Commander Simba &quot;Bosongo&quot; Mhlanga and William Amakonya, the man caught preparing to spring an ambush against President Robert Mugabe's motorcade on August 18 last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are the two men, plus the driver, who purport to have had direct intercourse with the accused. Naturally this court as well as the accused person would be entitled to have a look at the transcripts,&quot; Biti said as Sithole, 76, wearing a navy blue pin-stripe suit and floral tie, sat dozing in the dock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The veteran politician is the leader of the small ZANU (Ndonga) party and was at one time a colleague of Mugabe in the then Zimbabwe African National Union during the struggle for independence in Zimbabwe before he was deposed as leader in the early 1970s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His wife, Vesta, sat among some 30 supporters who filled the public benches in the huge mahogany-panelled A-Court, one of the more prestigious courtrooms at Mashonganyika Complex in the capital, Harare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-seven years ago, Sithole walked into the same building to answer charges of plotting to murder rebel Rhodesian Prime Minister, Ian Smith and two of his ministers. He was convicted and sentenced to six years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mhlanga and Namakonya are serving 15 and 12-year jail terms respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biti also challenged the state's decision to prosecute Sithole under three different charges--that he recruited people for illegal military training, kept arms of war and conspired to assassinate Mugabe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the three charges could be compounded into one of committing or attempting to commit acts of terrorism in contravention of a section of the law and order maintenance act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prosecuting Sithole under the three charges would be exposing him to &quot; double jeopardy&quot; given that two of the charges carry life imprisonment terms, Biti argued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also challenged the constitutionality of a section of the law and order maintenance act which requires the accused to prove beyond reasonable doubt his innocence, while a section of the constitution required proof on balance of probabilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting that the trial may not be held this year because of the expected delays, Biti applied for a further relaxation of Sithole's bail conditions, particularly the return of his passport and the 50,000 zimdollars(5,000 US dollars) still being held by the courts. Sithole was arrested in October last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bail sum was slashed from 100,000 zimdollars (10,000 US dollars) after Sithole said he wanted money to pay for his legal fees, and Biti argued that the remaining 50,000 zimdollars was immaterial given that the court still had Sithole's million-dollar house as surety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Devittie said he would announce his decision on the applications next Monday, after Abel Gotora of the attorney-general's office objected to the demand for more information on the witnesses, the compounding of the charges and relaxation of the bail conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he did not object to some of the matters being referred to the supreme court but the state would be reluctant to give details on some of the witnesses because Sithole might interfere with some of the witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also argued that there was a possibility that Sithole might abscond if his passport were to be returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The allegations against the accused are of a very serious nature. In fact, the state has been very understanding in agreeing to have him have part of his bail back,&quot; Gotora said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also accused the defence of springing a surprise by making applications without informing the state, adding that he suspected that the defence was indulging in delaying tactics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Justice is not a hide-and-seek game, as it were,&quot; Gotora said. But Biti objected, saying it was a personal attack.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA, Uganda (PANA) - Presidents Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Pasteur Bizimungu of Rwanda met Sunday in Mbarara, south of Kampala, ahead of a regional summit on Zaire as the fighting in that country entered its fourth week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bizimungu travelled to Museveni's country home in Rwakitura by road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday's regional summit in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, to discuss the crisis in eastern Zaire, is expected to be attended by the leaders of Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Cameroon, the current chairman of the Organization of Africa Unity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit will try to stop the fighting and ease the plight of more than a million refugees whom foreign aid workers have had to abandon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zairean Prime Minister Kengo Wa Dondo has been invited to represent President Mobutu Sese Seko, who is recovering from cancer surgery in Switzerland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union envoy to Zaire, Aldo Ajello, met with Zairean leaders in Kinshasa over the weekend and is due to meet Museveni before the Nairobi summit. O.A.U. Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim is also expected at the summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire last week ruled out negotiations with its neighbors Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda to stop the fighting. Kinshasa accused these countries of complicity in helping Zaire's ethnic Tutsi rebels, the Banyamurenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government will not undertake any negotiations, will not participate in any regional conference while part of our national territory is occupied by foreign forces,&quot; Kengo is reported to have told an emergency session of Zairean parliaments last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the three countries have denied the accusation and called on the warring parties to desist from any action that could escalate the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamurenge have seized a string of towns along Zaire's eastern border with Burundi and Rwanda but are said to be meeting some resistance in the eastern Zairean city of Goma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The town was the headquarters of the world's biggest relief operation, until aid workers fled Saturday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - Former emperor of the Central African Republic, Jean-Bedel Bokassa died Sunday of heart attack, aged 75 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement made by hospital officials in Bangui, the country's capital, was confirmed by Bokassa's relatives on Monday, according to reports reaching PANA in Dakar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bokassa suffered a heart attack in his Bangui home before he was taken to hospital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born in 1921 in Bobangui, Lobaye Province, he was raised by a missionary and completed his early education in missionary-run schools in his country and in Brazzaville, Congo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bokassa joined the French army in 1939 at age 18, as a regular soldier. He attended the Military Preparatory School in Saint Louis, Senegal, from 1947- 48 before going for further training in 1950 at the military Training Center at Chalons-Sur-Marne in France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a company sergeant and later Warrant Officer, still in the French army, Bokassa fought in the French Indo-China war of 1945-54. He won service campaign medals: the Legion d'Honneur Francaise a Titre Militaire, Campaign medals for the Second World War and Indo-China such as the Croix de Guerre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He became a second Lieutenant in 1958. At his country's independence from France in 1960, President David Dacko asked Bokassa to set up the Central African Republican Army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1962, Bokassa was transferred from the French army to that of the Central African Republic with the rank of a major.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a colonel and Chief of Staff of National Defence, Bokassa took power in January 1966 in a coup on New Year's eve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A general, marshall and life president, Bokassa amended the constitution in 1976 and was crowned emperor on Dec. 4, 1977 in Bangui.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was overthrown in 1979 by the French army while abroad. The operation, code-named Barracuda, followed the massacre of school children in Bangui.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former President Dacko, who returned to power and restored the republic, was in turn overthrown two years later by the army, led by Gen. Andre Kolingba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After eight years in exile in Cote d'Ivoire and France, Bokassa returned home in 1987, in disguise. However, he was arrested, prosecuted and sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was pardoned, then released by President Kolingba soon before the latter relinquished power to Ange-Felix Patasse who won multiparty elections in the country in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bokassa openly supported a section of the army which staged two failed mutinies in early 1996 in Bangui.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The British Overseas Development Agency (ODA) has donated K126 million to the Zambia Venture Capital Fund (ZVCF) to enable it boost administrative facilities and handle more business enquiries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officially presenting two Peugeot 405 cars and office equipment, British High Commissioner to Zambia, Patrick Nixon, said the ZVCF was one of the Commonwealth Development Corporation's exciting projects.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ZVCF came up as a way to help the private sector. It is one of the ways likely to reduce the dependence of the Zambian budget on foreign assistance and should be encouraged,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ODA donation is expected to help with funding for 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZVCF Board chairman, David Phiri, said he was grateful for the genuine help from the ODA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the type of investment Zambia should be aiming for,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZVCF general manager, Tladi Ramushu, said the Fund had received more than 200 inquiries from businessmen since its inception but only two projects have been approved so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to be highly selective of the projects and three more are in the pipeline,&quot; said Ramushu at the handover ceremony yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZVCF is a 10-year closed end fund. This means that it will be wound up and liquidated 10 years following commencement of operations. Meanwhile, the Fund identifies viable projects which need financing and buys equity, becoming shareholders in the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investors in ZVCF are the Commonwealth Development Corporation, the European Investment Bank, The German Investment and Development Company, and First Merchant Bank Zambia Limited.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, called on Sunday for humanitarian aid corridors to be set up between Zaire and Rwanda to enable refugees to return to Rwanda and Burundi. She said there were tens of thousands of displaced Zaireans as well as the mainly Hutu refugees from Burundi and Rwanda in need; the UN estimates more than one million civilians are fleeing fighting. Most are cut off from humanitarian aid - although local Zairean aid workers reportedly continue rudimentary relief in some areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Ogata, UNHCR has lost contact with 520,000 Burundi and Rwandan refugees since fighting broke out in the Uvira and Bukavu regions, and the vast majority of 715,000 refugees in the Goma region have fled over the last few days. She said 400,000 refugees in Mugunga and Lac Vert camps near Goma appeared to be heading for Sake (west of Goma on the northwest tip of Lake Kivu). French Consul Patrick Lumes, Goma, was reported (Sunday) as saying more than a million people were huddled in one Lake Kivu bay in &quot;appalling conditions&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ogata said Assistant High Commissioner Sergio Vieira de Mello would leave Monday (today) for Rwanda and Zaire to discuss with officials how to ease the crisis. She emphasised &quot;this may be a final appeal to all those involved in this terrible conflict or it will be too late&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN officials, diplomats and NGOs met in Kigali on Sunday to discuss emergency strategies, including humanitarian corridors. A key issue is whether the corridors will be supply or repatriation corridors - depending on the stance of Rwanda (who wants Hutu &quot;exiles&quot; back inside Rwanda) and Zaire (who may consider it &quot;support&quot; to the rebels, or a violation of sovereignty).  Corridors may be established with different functions, for example, those with a repatriation function may allow rudimentary supplies or be exclusively for refugee movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are continuing contacts between the Rwandan government, aid agencies, donors, UN officials and diplomats on ways to mitigate the humanitarian crisis and facilitate aid. Further discussions will take place today. In Nairobi (Sunday) NGOs and UN representatives met to discuss emergency relief strategies, and individual agencies are planning to establish emergency offices in Nairobi and elsewhere to coordinate response and set up programmes.  UNHCR says it has requested satellite images to assist in identifying the whereabouts and situation of the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Groups of Burundian returnees have been arriving back in their country of origin. About 11,000 have arrived at Gatumba during the course of last week, displaced when the Uvira camps were taken by rebels early on in the fighting.  Another 12,000 returnees arrived over the weekend, who have been registered by the Burundian army as having returned to the northwestern province of Cibitoke (which is mainly controlled by Hutu Burundian rebels). Of the 11,000, 700 have moved back to their home areas with the assistance of the government and aid agencies; 400 went to Gatumba town; and 300 moved to Bujumbura-Rurale. Action Contre le Faim (ACF) reports 17% severe malnutrition among 600 under 5s at Gatumba. This is one of the first indications that some of the dispersed refugees are arriving in a state of malnourishment - under 80% weight for height is classified as moderate by aid agencies).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DHA IRIN was informed that stocks of food already available in the region are estimated to be 78 days' worth, using half rations for two million people.  UNICEF said a plane (arranged through DHA's Military and Civil Defense Unit) carrying 30 tonnes of medical supplies was leaving Copenhagen for Uganda's Entebbe airport, and more supplies would follow. Access points for emergency supplies are Kigali (previous stocks exist in anticipation of refugees returning), Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya. Burundi is also a possible access point, although presently gripped by regional sanctions following the July coup. The Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee had refused the passage of any food aid through or to Burundi, but relaxed conditions on October 21st to allow for displaced Burundians - it therefore stands as a possible land route. The Rwandan government has refused since April 1995 to allow food to pass through Rwanda to refugee camps in eastern Zaire, which held many of those implicated in the 1994 Rwandan genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid workers in the region have noted the following impediments to operations: aid vehicles and logistical equipment have been looted and commandeered; the relief structures have been destroyed; air drops are impracticable because refugees are scattered; chronic fuel shortages and poor road access and continued fighting. Refugees are faced with hostile geographical terrain as well as fighting - mountains, volcanic ground and forests, often in torrential rain. There are continued reports of bodies washed up on the shores of Lake Tanganika.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laurent-Desire Kabila, identified as head of the rebel coordinating committee, called on Sunday for aid organisations to return to eastern Zaire.  He declared Bukavu and Goma, the two main towns of eastern Zaire, under rebel control, and said they planned to re-open Goma airport. Kabila said on the BBC (Monday) that Kiliba airstrip, servicing Uvira, was available. He said there was famine and continued population movement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees called Sunday for the urgent opening of emergency lifelines to more than 1.2 million Burundi and Rwandan refugees and tens of thousands of displaced Zairians caught in the fighting in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">High Commision Sadako Ogata also announced she was dispatching Assistant High Commissioner Sergio Vieria de Mello to Rwanda and Zaire to discusss with high officals waoys of easing the refugee crisis in the Great Lakes region.  Vieira de Mello is scheduled to leave Geneva on Monday for Kagali.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This may be a final appeal to all those involved in this terrible conflict, or it will bne too late.. Combatants should stop attacking refugees. The refdugees from the largest camps in the region are on the move towards some of the most inhospitable and inaccessible areas in Zaire. The further the refugees move west, the more difficult it will be for us to reach them. It may make repatriation and reconciliation impossible, &quot; Ogata said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must open lifelines to the refugees and displaced people now, wherever they are. We must open humanitarian corridors to enable refugees to return in safety to Rwanda and Burundi. Unless we reach the refugees soon, many women and children, the elderly, the sick and the wounded are going top die,&quot; Ogata said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heavy fighting forced UNHCR's remaining 14 expatriate workers in eastern Zaire to evacuate from the refugee town of Goma on Saturday. They were among 130 expatriate workers from the UN agencies and non-governmental organisations who took advantage of a lull in the fighting and dashed to the Rwandan border town of Giisenyi after being trapped for several days in their offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 1.2 million of the more than 1.8 million Rwandan and Burundi refugees are in Zaire. The rest are in Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the fighting broke out in the Uvira and Bukavu regions two weeks ago, UNHCR has had no contacts with the 520,000 refugees there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Goma region, which orginally cared for 715,000 Rwandan refiugees, UNHCR has learned that refugees have abandoned Katale Camp, many of them heading south toward the Sake area at the northwestern tip of Lake Kivu. Some 20,000 refugees from Katale, comprising mainly the sick and elderly and other vulnerable groups, are in nearby Tshondo in the Virungu national park area.  Katale's original population was 202,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the estimated 400,000 Rwandan refugees crammed in Mugunga and Lac Vert camps just to the east of Goma town have reportedly left for Sake. The Mugunga and Lac Vert camps included some 194,000 refugees from Kibumba camp, which was attacked one week ago. Another camp, Kahindo, which had 115,000 refugees was emptied on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ogata said humanitarian corridors should be opened to enable refugees to return to their countries. She said these passages could be used to transport relief to the refugees and displaced Zairians wherever thet are in eastern zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The High Commissioner noted that about 1,700 Rwandan refugees have so far arrived in Rwanda. She said this may be because many refugees could not cross battle lines. She renewed her pledge that UNHCR would od everything in its power to help returnees. She noted that80,000 Rwandan refugees who returned to Rwanda in July and August are now beginning a new life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 11,400 refugees, mostly Zairians but including Rwandans, have arrived in southern Uganda. In Burundi 10,157 refugees have arrived from Zaire.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg -- Given the way that weapons have been used in the Great Lakes region of Africa, Amnesty International is calling on the international community to stop and prevent the transfer of weapons and ammunition to the armed forces, militia and other armed groups in Zaire, Burundi and Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation is an explosive and catastrophic one affecting countless refugees and civilians in these countries. It has been widely acknowledged that the area is awash with small arms despite previous commitments by the international community to restrict them,&quot; Pierre Sane, Secretary General of Amnesty International, said during a visit to South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reprisal killings by all sides mean that further arms supplies will exacerbate the conflict and lead to further atrocities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization said that arms of various origins, including Belgian, Chinese, Chilean, Egyptian, French, German, Israeli, Russian, Romanian, South African, US and Yugoslav, have reportedly been found in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been arms deliveries to Zaire, Burundi and Rwanda despite serious human rights abuses by the armed forces and associated militia, especially in the border areas. In Rwanda, members of the Rwandese Patriotic Army (RPA) have extra-judicially executed several hundred unarmed civilians in 1996 during military operations against armed insurgents. In Burundi, the largely Tutsi-dominated security forces and militia are continuing to massacre hundreds of unarmed Hutu civilians, including returnees from Zaire.  Furthermore, Burundi armed opposition groups have also carried out arbitrary killings of Tutsi civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations (UN) Security Council last year set up an International Commission of Inquiry to investigate allegations that the exiled former Rwandese armed forces and militia, many of whom led or participated in crimes against humanity during 1994, were obtaining arms and continuing military training near refugee camps despite a UN arms embargo. Despite limited resources and a lack of cooperation by many governments, especially the Government of Zaire which denied entry to its investigators, the Commission has reported that such arms deliveries and military training have been continuing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Recent reports of deliberate and arbitrary killings and other grave abuses committed by Zairean soldiers and the Banyamulenge armed opposition in eastern Zaire are part of a much broader pattern of atrocities carried out to a greater or lesser extent by all sides in the conflict along the Zairian border with Rwanda and Burundi,&quot; said Mr Sane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International is also calling on the Government of Zaire and other governments in the Great Lakes region to cooperate fully with the UN and to allow the independent international monitoring of all cargo entering Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire by land, sea and air to ensure that no deliveries contain weapons or ammunition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If these governments want the world to believe that their armed forces do not condone or assist militia which commit grave violations, then they should allow international investigators complete access to demonstrate this is not so,&quot; said Mr Sane.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - A three week ceasefire has been announced by the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) to allow international aid agencies to repatriate 1.2 million refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laurent-Desire Kaliba, ADFL spokesman speaking from Bukavu, said the unilaterally-declared ceasefire would take effect from 5pm local time.  According to a BBC report, he said that the rebels would not hesitate to strike back if attacked - but that the three towns controlled by the ADFL (Bukavu, Goma and Uvira) were &quot;calm' because Zairean soldiers and government officials had fled. If the ceasefire holds, refugees have been given three weeks to repatriate to their country of origin; Kabila said those who refused to leave would be &quot;re-grouped&quot; and put in camps away from &quot;exiled&quot; Hutu extremists implicated in the Rwandan 1994 genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late reports from Swiss media say that Mobutu left Switzerland today aboard a private plane to an undisclosed location.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A UN official reported after visiting a feeding centre in Gatumba (Burundi) for returnees from Eastern Zaire that some of the children were &quot;skin and bone&quot;. He told IRIN that severe malnourishment in the under 5s was probably because &quot;some children were not in great shape before they had to spend five or more days in the bush&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebel announcement of a ceasefire will be welcomed by the international community, though there will be pressure to secure a mutually agreed one. UN Special Mediator Raymond Chretien is seeking an immediate ceasefire - but will not be in the region until after November 5 (US presidential elections).  European Union's Irish presidency today also issued an appeal for a ceasefire, from Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring. Officials of the European Union and international humanitarian organisations will meet in Brussels on Thursday.  UNHCR Assistant High Commissioner Sergio Vieira de Mello is anticipated to arrive in Kigali today. The UNDP resident coordinator in Kigali held a meeting of representatives today (4pm local time) from NGOs, UN, donors and diplomats to further discuss the setting up of humanitarian corridors. An Organisation of African Unity (OAU) peace mission arrived in Rwanda on Sunday, and Rwanda's president visited Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France has issued a number of statements, including calls for an immediate ceasefire. French presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said today that France had &quot;increased diplomatic and humanitarian efforts&quot; in search of a solution. France's secretary of state for humanitarian aid, Xavier Emmanuelli, said on Saturday that France was ready to &quot;put everything into a humanitarian operation coordinated with Europe and United Nations agencies&quot;, and were studying access routes. The French NGO Medicins Sans Frontieres issued a statement from Paris today calling for immediate international military intervention, to create safe havens and disarm the fighting forces - which is what the French military did in 1994 in Rwanda. The MSF statement said, however, that &quot;by calling for international intervention, MSF does not call for a repeat of Operation Turquoise which was politically biased and inadequate&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speculation continues about the willingness of France to militarily intervene in the conflict - Reuters and AFP both report today that France has &quot;implied&quot; it is ready to send in troops, possibly dependent on the outcome of the regional head of states meeting in Nairobi tomorrow (Tuesday). Spain said on Monday it would support any UN-approved military intervention in Zaire and &quot;would consider the possibility&quot; of sending troops. Italy has also called for &quot;suitable measures of protection&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports of fighting have diminished. This morning Goma was reported as quiet, but other reports suggest sporadic fighting around Bukavu airport - expected to effect three more refugee camps. Of the two largest camps Kashusha 37,000, and Inera 54,555, Kashusha camp was reported on Friday as still being controlled by the Interahamwe. There are different opinions on whether dispersed refugees are moving predominantly north or west; according to Paul Stronber, regional spokesman for UNHCR, most are heading west, but there are also reports from NGOs of movement north, into the Zairean hills.  BBC reported that rebels had taken control of Ishasha border post on the Ugandan border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statements from Kinshasa continue to accuse both Rwanda and Burundi - whose governments are Tutsi-dominated - of sending forces in to help rebels in Zaire. Zairean Prime Minister Kengo Wa Dondo said on Saturday that negotiations to end the fighting can only procede once Rwandan troops had withdrawn from the area. Rwanda rejects persistant reports by journalists and diplomats that its forces entered Goma (Zaire) to support Tutsi rebels, but Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu called last week for a revision of borders agreed during the colonial era - referring to &quot;natural borders&quot;. In response, the Zairean Prime Minister has said he is willing to discuss frontiers; but pointed out that colonial borders were revised in 1910 when Zaire (during a meeting between Belgium, Germany and Britain) was obliged to cede land to Rwanda and Uganda (including the border town of Gisenyi). He said the portion of territory ceded should be &quot;returned&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Uganda and Rwanda have offered to &quot;help&quot; resolve the conflict. Rwanda says it will work with the international community to solve the &quot;internal crisis&quot; in Zaire. Rwanda is reportedly insisting that negotiated humanitarian corridors must be for repatriation purposes only, and not to support &quot;exile Hutu extremists&quot;. So far, returning refugees to Rwanda are very few.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi is due to host a regional summit on the crisis on Tuesday (heads of state from Cameroon, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia were anticipated). Foreign ministers are meeting in Nairobi today (Monday) in preparation - Zaire is boycotting the meeting.  The Rwandan Foreign minister is in Nairobi for the pre-summit meeting; the Minister for Rehabilitation and Social Integration will represent Rwanda at the summit on Tuesday (November 5). Kenyan state radio reported on Sunday that President Daniel arap Moi had told President Nelson Mandela (South Africa) by telephone that it would be &quot;prudent&quot; for him to suspend all arms sales to Rwanda (referring to a recent 18 million dollars arms sale agreed, but subsequently reconsidered by South Africa). Regional meetings like tomorrow's summit have gained new weight since regional sanctions were effectively imposed for the first time, following the July Burundi coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire radio reported on Sunday that presidential advisor Ngbanda Nzambo ko Atume had left Kinshasa to carry personal messages from President Mobutu to the presidents of Zambia, Kenya, Tanzania and South Africa. Rebel spokesman Kabila said in a BBC interview on Monday (today) that Zaire was &quot;leaderless&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other countries touched by the regional crisis are: Zambia, which has reported the arrival of more than 1,000 Rwandan refugees since the fighting started; Sudan, which claims that fighting may affect some 145,000 Sudanese refugees in Zaire - Sudan's commissioner general for refugees, Mohammad Ahmad Hussein Abdul Aleim, said in the same statement that Sudan is expecting Hutu refugees; and Uganda, which said in a statement from the foreign ministry that it was assisting discplaced Zaireans by providing safe passage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A WFP report (WFP Eastern Zaire Situation Report 4 November) says that people continue arriving at Kigoma, Tanzania and other ports - &quot;unconfirmed reports put arrivals at about 2,000&quot;. World Vision on Monday put the number at 4,500 over the last five days. WFP also reports 10,000 people arriving at Ishasha and 6,800 at Kisoro in Uganda - WFP and World Vision say the vast majority of these people are Zairean nationals - often Hutu. Peter Kessler, UNHCR Nairobi, told IRIN there were a total of 9,000 refugees on the Ugandan border at Kisoro, Ishasha and Butogota.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eye-witnesses to the fighting report a reluctance of Zairean troops to fight, as well as ill-discipline. Laurent-Desire Kabila, rebel spokesman, claims the Zairean army is &quot;in disarray&quot;, leaving weapons behind as they flee.  The Zairean armed forces chief General Eluki Monga Aunda has complained (Saturday) that the government is failing to provide the national army with the means to resist. The press reports executions of civilians in the fighting zones by unidentified soldiers/militia - and eccentric behavior (stripping naked) by armed men has been televised.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - There are five places available to Africa at the World Cup finals for the first time and competition for tickets to France is likely to be as fierce as the equatorial sun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olympic champions Nigeria look as certain as anything can be in football to win Group 1, partly because they are easily the strongest team and partly because Guinea, Kenya and Burkina Faso offer modest opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Choosing the winners of the other four groups is far more complicated with the list of possible finalists outstretching those who can only dream of viewing Paris from the Eiffel Tower.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North African giants Egypt and Tunisia come head to head in Group 2 where the presence of World, European and African Footballer of the Year George Weah makes Liberia dangerous outsiders.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia may be ranked No 1 in Africa by world governing body Fifa, but Nations Cup titleholders South Africa pose a major threat in Group 3 and Zaire are capable of beating both countries to the tape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take your pick in Group 4 from Cameroon, who are not the force that held Italy spellbound six years ago, a Zimbabwe squad coached by former Liverpool star Bruce Grobbelaar, and rapidly improving Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another three-team race seems set to unfold in Group 5 with Morocco achieving excellent results under Frenchman Henri Michel, Gabon on an upward curve, and Ghana desperate to exorcise World Cup ghosts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This list excludes Kenya, Namibia, Congo, Togo and Burundi, all of whom have slayed giants, and dare anyone suggest they are not capable of springing further surprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notable preliminary-round victims included Algeria, who represented Africa at the World Cup twice, 1992 African Nations Cup winners Ivory Coast, Mozambique, Senegal and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With so much fame and fortune awaiting the countries who reach the 32- nation finals, the only certainty ahead of the 60 qualifying fixtures is that more shocks are almost inevitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria have so many European-based professionals to choose from that national coach Amodu Shaibu selected separate squads for a friendly in Turkey and the opening World Cup tie at home to Burkina Faso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last time the Burkinabe visited the Surulere Stadium in Lagos they were caught in a seven-goal avalanche and any result other than another comfortable victory for the Super Eagles would be a shock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A strong East European influence hangs over the other Group 1 match in which Guinea host Kenya, whose elimination of Algeria ranked 10 on the Richter Football Scale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guinea are coached by Vladimir Muntain, a midfielder whose smooth skills often looked out of place in the robot-like national teams fielded by the Soviet Union during the 1970s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya owe much to Yugoslav Vojo Gardesevic, who had barely settled in when Algeria were dispatched, although subsequent performances in the Simba Four Nations Cup left much to be desired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egypt figured in the first qualifying match involving an African country 63 years ago while Namibia only achieved independence and a place in the international football community during this decade. Goalkeeper Ronnie Kanalelo was the hero of the preliminary triumph over Mozambique and he will have to be in top form to prevent the Pharaohs running riot in Cairo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia should have entertained 1996 Nations Cup runners-up Tunisia in Monrovia, but the capital still bears the scars of a six-year civil war and the fixture will probably be switched to Accra in Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Think of Liberia and Weah springs to mind. Here is a true patriot who not only plays for his country, but captains the team, pays the air fares from Europe for fellow professionals, and feeds and accommodates them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Think of Tunisia and Henri Kasperczak springs to mind. A silver-haired, middle-aged man born in Poland and a citizen of France, he is considered the leading coach on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many South Africans might disagree as Clive Barker has enjoyed incredible success since assuming command almost three years ago and guiding Bafana Bafana to Nations Cup glory. His biggest headache ahead of a home fixture against unpredictable Zaire is finding the right forward combination from Shaun Bartlett, Philemon Masinga, Mark Williams and Brendan Augustine. Jerry Sikhosana and Pollen Ndlanya must have their supporters too, but the intimidatng cauldron of World Cup football is hardly the place to introduce raw talent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia travel north to tackle Congo on a bumpy, grassless Pointe-Noire pitch which former Nigeria and Sundowns coach Clemens Westerhof claimed would give even a donkey a hernia. A model of consistency, Zambia are coached by Dane Roald Poulsen, captained by Mexican-based midfielder Kalusha Bwalya, and rely heavily on young Dennis Lota for goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Congolese shocked Ivory Coast in mid-year with little-known Charles Imboula the hero, scoring a late goal to complete a 2-0 first- leg victory and snatching the equaliser in Abidjan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belgian Henri Depireux is the latest coach charged with the task of restoring the Indomitable Lions from Cameroon to the lofty position they once inhabited. He begins in Togo, who ousted Senegal in the preliminaries and boast an excellent forward in Bachirou Salou, one of a growing band of African stars performing in the German Bundesliga. Cameroon may have lost much of the flair that Monsieur Milla delivered so spectacularly, but they remain a well-organised outfit as Gabon discovered in a recent, goalless Nations Cup qualifier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe, who have not reached the finals of a major tournament, are on a roll under Grobbelaar, who was born in Durban, began his professional career in Canada, became a hero on Merseyside, and is revered in his adopted country.  The Warriors defeated Tanzania 1-0 in their first outing under the colourful and controversial goalkeeper and then triumphed 3-0 in Sudan, where away victories are as rare as tarred roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angola should prove difficult opponents, especially in Luanda where 80000 fans will pack the Citadela Stadium to see if ace forward Antonio Alves can outwit &quot;Jungle Man&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morocco are due to host Burundi, but at the time of going to press the match was in doubt because an economic blockade against the tiny Central African country prohibits flights arriving or leaving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be tragic if the footballers became the latest victims of a coup d'etat which has succeeded only in heightening the misery suffered by the people of the ethnically divided nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifa are anxious to avoid byes so Sierra Leone, who were defeated by Burundi last June, would probably be invited to step in should The Swallows find it impossible to reach North Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana were relegated to third seeds in Group 5 behind Morocco and Gabon because of poor form in previous tournaments where they lost to Guinea, Libya, Liberia and Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Black Stars will also lack injured forward Anthony Yeboah, which adds to the attacking burden falling on young Felix Aboagye from leading Egyptian club Al-Ahly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opponents Gabon, who enjoy home advantage and need maximum points to pose a serious threat to the Moroccans, have prepared thoroughly with home matches against Mali, Cameroon and Burkina Faso.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Just a couple of months after the last competitors' bus got lost in Atlanta, cities have begun the race to host the 2004 Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are not at all what you would expect. There are 15 of them, slightly stern-looking, definitely bleary-eyed, weighed down by details of infrastructure and facilities and statistics, and carrying, in their pens, the power to put a city on the world stage for two weeks in August 2004 and on the world map for a long time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In three months, finishing on December 10, they will have been to St Petersburg, Stockholm, Lille, Seville, Rome, Istanbul, Athens, San Juan, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires and Cape Town. They arrived in Greece this week and by December even The Who won't have seen as many stadiums as this lot.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 15 are the International Olympic Committee's (IOC)vanguard, the technical assessment committee for the 11 cities bidding to host the 2004 Games. They are charged with making sure that, after Atlanta, the IOC does not get fooled again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But their life is far from the freeloading that is generally associated with Olympic bidding. &quot;We have not arranged to even take them out for dinner,&quot; said Gianna Angelopoulos, president of the Athens bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They told us they would prefer to stay in their rooms and read the bid documents, so we are respecting that.&quot; Rehearsals of where the 15 will go, the exhibitions and displays they will see, the VIPs they will meet, amendments to the bundles they will lug to their next port of call, have been going on for two weeks. Those bid documents are the first step in a process that, in Athens's case, has already lasted eight years if you count the dramatic failure of their bid for 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bundle of three volumes weighs 3kg in a charming brown cardboard box, not as nice as Barcelona's (which was metal and stood upright like a small filing cabinet) but more pleasing than Atlanta's (a tacky bundle of colourful documents in a blue box). The details inside, from average temperature, to ground plans of the venues, to telecom price bands and capacities in dollars and kilobits for unscheduled Eutelsat transmission, are mind-numbingly thorough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Athens is a serious candidate. There are already 40 full-time staff attached to the bid team in their imposing Zappeion headquarters and they have been ferrying some of the world's press to the city for a couple of weeks now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether they will actually win nobody will know until September 1997, but the first hurdle is approval by the fastidious 15, granted or refused when they whittle the list down to five cities in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Athens was previously polluted and run-down, deemed too reliant on cars and too tainted by pollution and gridlock. So the government and city council are spending $2,6-billion increasing the size of their metro and doubling passenger capacity to 780 000 per day. The airport was deemed old-fashioned so a new one is being built on a site north of the city with capacity to handle 16-million passengers a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New roads, new stadiums, a population who are 96% behind the bid, a programme to reduce pollution by 35%, $11-billion to be invested in information technology. All impressive stuff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Athens bid could hardly be better timed after the commercialism and tackiness of Atlanta. The mood may well be that a return to the spiritual home of the games is overdue, something emphasised if one visits ancient Olympia, where the first games were held and which now houses an Olympic academy aimed at propagating the slightly nebulous values of Olympianism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The original Olympic stadium is there too, and with its original grassy banks that would probably not pass muster for today's IOC technocrats. They might be more impressed with the ancient Olympian approach to sporting misdemeanour: cheats were forced to erect a statue of Zeus at the entrance to the ancient stadium with their name, parents' and grandparents' names and home town inscribed on the base to act as an example to every athlete going into the stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l The technical commission is charged with whittling down the 11 cities who want to host the 2004 Olympic Games to five. These will then be considered by the 91-strong IOC .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though they are supposed to restrict their considerations to technical merit, only the most naive expect them to ignore completely the vagaries of Olympic politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town will make it unless the commission is put off by South Africa's lack of political experience or possible organisational problems. But an African Olympics is long overdue. Rome and Stockholm are also virtually assured because of excellent facilities, though Stockholm's population is not keen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Athens and Buenos Aires are likely to sneak in, Buenos Aires because it is in Latin America, a vital IOC constituency, and Athens because a return to tradition is desirable after Atlanta.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Defeat on the Springbok tour that gets under way this week could be disastrous for Andre Markgraaff's 'vision'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMID the emotional storm which has raged around the Springbok touring squad, the dissatisfaction about financial packages for the players and the rank idiocy of the nutters of the game issuing death threats to coach Andre Markgraaff, one crucial matter has got lost in the maelstrom. There is an extremely tough job of work ahead for Gary Teichmann and his side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the next 48 days, the 36-strong squad travels to two continents and has five tough Tests to negotiate, two each against the Argentinian Pumas and the French, and an international against the resurgent Welsh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also two side issues which need to be addressed. First, Markgraaff, as a direct result of his outpourings on a seemingly as yet uncharted vision for Springbok rugby, has placed himself and the side in the position of having to win. There can be no thought of coming second now and attempting to lay the blame on errant goal-kicking, bad bounces of the ball, one-eyed refereeing or the vagaries of the South African media.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second point is that Teichmann has been handed a job in circumstances no captain should be placed in and faces the task of trying to weld together a touring party riven by the provincialistic thinking of old and the hugely varying contracts of the as yet largely ill-defined professional age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is no wonder that some of the more thinking players are less than keen to make the trip. For apart from all the internal problems Teichmann has to deal with off the field, there is the central business of making Springbok rugby work on it. Against the Argentinians, this is far from a walk in the park. The South Americans, like many of the nations on the fringe of rugby's major league, delight in making life difficult for the big names in the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pumas may have several holes in their overall make-up, but taking the game to the opposition in the most direct and physical way is not one of them.  They are as hard and uncompromising as any Louis Luyt edict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday's tour opener against Mendoza will be just the start of it. And it is from the opening game that Markgraaff will have to settle on his Test side for the opening international in Buenos Aires next Saturday, grafting the hard realities of reshaping the face of Springbok rugby into a team of winners once again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, the scenario is exactly as former coach Kitch Christie paints it.  &quot;Remember,&quot; says one of the game's shrewdest judges, &quot;that the scrummaging of the Argentinian front row is perhaps the best in world rugby right now.&quot; Without first-choice loosehead Os du Randt, injured in a freak accident at his Bloemfontein home, Markgraaff has only Marius Hurter - a willing but as yet unfulfilled tighthead - to prop the other side of the scrum as a specialist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equally there must be a host of silent prayers winging their way heavenwards that veteran Andre Joubert sees out the tour without injury. One cannot help but feel that Russell Bennett is not the man to fill Joubert's boots in the event of a mishap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would mean a shuffling of the side that would put James Small back in the No 15 jersey he wore earlier this season before Markgraaff sidelined the errant genius of the Natal flier for disciplinary reasons. Likewise, with the doubts over Hennie le Roux, Henry Honiball's position at flyhalf becomes a problem that his tour deputy Franco Smith does not immediately seem the answer to in the case of injury. Neither does the prospect of young utility back Breyton Paulse inspire great confidence as a Test player, despite the talent he undoubtedly owns and will polish in the seasons to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where, you have to ask yourself, is Gavin Lawless, a player with the ability and pedigree to fill either of these positions in the crunch?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strange this, for the idea of a &quot;vision&quot; surely means more than a pretty picture conjured up with your eyes closed to the nastiness of day-to-day reality. It should also mean a broadening of thought, but then lateral thinking has never played a huge part in the deliberations of our rugby administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as tough as the Argentinian leg of the tour promises to be, the five games which follow in France have all the uncompromising feel of a chunk of the Pyrenees. Apart from the Tests in Bordeaux and at the Parc de Princes in Paris, there are games against the French Barbarians - amost a full Tricolor side in all but name - and two provincial selections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latter two games provide the French with the ideal opportunity to do what Australia and New Zealand managed so successfully in the Super 12: blood top players in what amount to national trial games against the world champions, and soften the South Africans up for the internationals. This, one feels, does show some vision on the part of the French.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also makes things extremely difficult for Teichmann as a leader.  Markgraaff has surely already mapped out his Test side. His history of sticking to what he believes to be right must underline this as fact. For how else could he have insisted on picking two players - Christiaan Scholtz and Boeta Wessels - who were still on the injury list when he named them and have subsequently opted to stay at home?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is this rigidity of thinking on the part of the coach, his insistence on sticking to a game plan if you like, that threatens to be the biggest obstacle facing the Springboks in France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For physical as they undoubtedly are, the French have the ability to throw away the coaching manual and turn the structures of a game into a mystical and mysterious maze of magic. Against this mercurial ability, settling your game plan on whether to throw to the front or back jumpers in the line-out is simply not enough. There has to be free rein of initiative allowed the captain on the field. One wonders whether this will be the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to return to the way Markgraaff has postioned himself personally and the team in general, victory from the very start becomes paramount.  Resounding losses in the opening leg of the tour in South America could have a distrous trickle-down effect on the rest of it and on a squad where the welding already shows signs of metal fatigue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All this also suggests that while Wales may have had their problems over the last decade, they still present a formidable threat on their home turf in the last Test at Cardiff Arms before the stadium is reshaped for the 1999 World Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A side with the smell of defeat in its nostrils, the hint of home and Christmas just 10 days distant can hardly be expected to run out as winners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One can only hope Teichmann and his men are equal to the task the selectors have set them, give the touring party the support patriotism if nothing else owes them ... and then perhaps cast one's eyes heavenwards yet again.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - As India struggle to find form, the whole South African team has contributed to a great winning percentage</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Can India stop the SA juggernaut?&quot; intoned the local daily newspaper in Rajkot on the day before South Africa's third game against the host nation before the visitors' penultimate match in the round-robin phase of the Titan Cup. It was a hopeless plea, pissing against the wind, to use the Australian vernacular. South Africa have shoved the &quot;law of averages&quot;, so long the saviour of millions of bookmakers' souls, back down their throats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even the West Indies,&quot; confirms Fanie de Villiers, &quot;never came close to matching the South African winning percentage. At the height of their dominance their best winning average was 67%. We are currently averaging over 95% of wins.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Indian media has for many years, like the bookmakers, relied on the law of averages to balance their losses. Significantly, no one spoke about one- day cricket being a lottery in the early 1980s when the Indian side was good enough to beat any team in the world - and good enough to win the World Cup.  All- rounders like Ravi Shastri, Kapil Dev, Mohinder Armanath, Madan Lal and Roger Binny gave the team such depth that options were never limited and no single player carried a greater burden of expectation than any other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers are rightly convinced that the boy- genius Sachin Tendulkar is becoming paralysed by the yoke around his neck. Only former captain Mohammed Azharrudin has the ability and experience to share the burden of scoring India's runs but, so far, the damage has been done before, or soon after, Azhar's arrival at the crease. None of this, quite rightly, bothers the South Africans but you can bet your house on the fact that they know exactly what is going on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Their mental attitude is all wrong,&quot; says Allan Donald. &quot;I can't believe they didn't put Sachin at number three, or four, for one of the games against us. He seems to think that he would be hiding, but he doesn't realise that we would then be thinking 'shit they've still got Tendulkar to come ...' At the moment India rely way too much on him, and that makes it easy for the opposition to target the heart of the team.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As much as India's heart is open, South Africa's is completely hidden. It is impossible to target the main area of strength or the main area of weakness, for the identification of either is the first step towards creating a winning strategy. The great Australian former captain, Ian Chappell, declared after South Africa's opening brace of wins over India and Australia that &quot;Gary Kirsten must be stopped if either team is to upset Cronje's men&quot;.  Kirsten failed in his next two matches, yet Daryll Cullinan scored 106 and 71 not out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jonty Rhodes, man-of-the-match with a vital 54 in the fifth victory, says simply: &quot;We dovetail. It's a simple strategy ... one of the top four batsmen aims to bat through 90% of the innings. But the guy at the other end must support him by taking a few risks on his behalf. Nobody is selfish. If a guy becomes well set, and is poised to go right through, then the batter at the other end must aim to take the pressure off him by picking up boundaries when they are needed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This concept is alien to the transitional Indian team who are so desperate to secure their place that risk-taking is the last thing on their minds.  Witness opener Saurav Ganguly scoring 50 off 104 deliveries when India were chasing South Africa's target of 250. At the same moment it was an innings that kept him in the team yet lost that game as surely as if he had made 0 in 100 balls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One-day cricket may be a batsman's game (every player who has ever bowled a ball for South Africa will tell you that) but surely it is a mistake to believe that Kirsten, Hudson, Cullinan, Cronje and Rhodes are playing the major role currently? Consider the following: while every supporter, writer and broadcaster was overtly aware of Kirsten's extraordinary world record for the highest number of one-day runs in a calendar year, how many people were even aware that Allan Donald broke the bowlers' equivalent during the Titan Cup? Only a handful of bowlers have ever averaged over two wickets per match in their one-day careers (Wasim Akram heads the list with 2,1 wickets per match and Waqar Younis has a fraction over 2). Donald, in his last nine games, has taken 29. In the year to date (not including Friday's final league match against Australia in Guwahati) he has taken 49 wickets in 18 games. That is the finest strike rate that this form of the game has ever seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even less celebrated are the exploits of Fanie de Villiers who comfortably heads the list of current players conceding fewer than four runs an over. In fact, it is a very short list - three. Of fast and medium-paced bowlers, Australia's Glenn McGrath concedes 3,9 runs an over, his teammate Paul Reiffel goes for 3,85 and Fanie costs a mere 3,4 runs an over. Against India in Rajkot he bowled his first six overs for eight runs and eventually conceded 19 runs in nine overs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Villiers makes an interesting point: &quot;Take the last 250 one-day internationals played around the world, and analyse how many hundreds, fifties and four-wicket hauls there have been. Then, just for interest's sake, count how many times a bowler has conceded less than 30 runs from his overs.&quot; That De Villiers conceded less than 20 (albeit from nine overs) was rarer still. Much, much rarer than a half-century. And if only three quick bowlers concede less than four runs an over, the number is only slightly greater (five) amongst slow bowlers. Pat Symcox, needless to say, is amongst that elite group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When South Africa beat India in Kajkot for the third time the local press castigated the Indian team for not &quot;taking advantage of an under-strength SA side&quot;. But judging from the performances of Herschelle Gibbs and Lance Klusener, Cronje is handicapped only by their lack of experience - most certainly not by their lack of ability or talent. And as for the left-arm spinner Nicky Boje, he appears at least the equal of off-spinner Derek Crookes, and they are all more than useful batsmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And just like the Indian side of the early 1980s, the current South African squad contains seven players regarded as all- rounders (Cronje, MacMillan, Boje, Crookes, Klusener, Symcox and Richardson). This batting depth may not have been needed or tested yet, but the fact that it is there gives great heart to the top clutch of specialist batsmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, to the question that every cricket lover in India has been asking - &quot; How do you stop the SA juggernaut?&quot; - oddly enough, De Villiers provides the best clue. &quot;We win 75% of all our matches in the first 16 overs of each innings,&quot; he states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer, then, is to make sure De Villiers is not so economical and that Kirsten and co do not add 80. How to do that is another story altogether.  Until the answer is found, the morning-after-the-day-before headlines are likely to stay the same as they were in Rajkot's daily paper: &quot;SA juggernaut carries on!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - 'I'm a Pirate, I was born a Pirate and I will die a Pirate.&quot; Those were the words of an ardent soccer fan when I enquired about the outcome of Saturday's Bob Save Superbowl semifinal clash between Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chief at the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And most certainly, the way Pirates have been performing of late it would seem that the Sea Robbers would have to die if they want to advance to the final of South Africa's version of the FA Cup. But in South Africa, when Chiefs and Pirates meet, no matter what the competition, Soweto and most of Johannesburg's townships come to a standstill.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Soweto derby usually has all the ingredients of a cracker: pride, passion, skill and flair, and Saturday should be no exception when the two sides clash for the second time this year. Earlier this year they played to a goalless draw in the Coca-Cola Challenge. But on Saturday there has to be a winner, even if it means the game going to penalties, as many expect it will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Buccaneers are struggling at the moment and seem set to be hammered by an Amakhosi outfit that is currently looking quite impressive. Pirates are likely to be without goalkeeper William Okpara, one of the club's key players.  In the past, Okpara has single- handedly thwarted opponents to lead his team to victory. Okpara is on national duty for the Nigerian national side in Turkey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, in the past few weeks there have been whispers of some turmoil and discontent in the Pirates camp, and that Russian coach Victor Bondarenko is on his way out after a string of poor performances, which culminated in a 3-0 hammering by Real Rovers in a league game last weekend. But as yet there has been no official word, so &quot;Mind Your Language&quot; as Bondarenko is known, lives on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, as we have become accustomed to now, no matter how badly Pirates are performing, nothing motivates them more than the sight of a black and yellow shirt, as was pointed out in Abidjan when Pirates achieved the impossible in beating ASEC at home to win the African Champions Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, although not in the class of past Chiefs outfits, Neil Tovey and his side have impressed with the fact that they are picking up the points. And one of the main reasons they have been doing so is due to the form of prolific goalscorer Pollen Ndlanya, who has been on target seven times so far this campaign. Since the beginning of the year Ndlanya has scored 17 goals in all competitions and looks set to continue on Saturday.  Ndlanya has hit a purple patch and he received his reward with a call-up from national coach Clive Barker for the World Cup game against Zaire. But he is a player who stays away from the hard stuff and the man who is likely keep a tight watch on Ndlanya's movements is burly Pirates defender Gavin &quot;Stability Unit&quot; Lane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pirates will be pinning their hopes on Jerry Sikhosana, another player who has been called up by Barker for the Zaire game. Cape Town Spurs meet Jomo Cosmos in the other semifinal on Sunday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - IN SEARCH OF WILL CARLING: AN EPIC JOURNEY THROUGH AFRICA TO THE RUGBY WORLD CUP by Charles Jacoby (Simon &amp; Schuster, R90)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RUGGER-BUGGERS who buy this book before spotting the subtitle may believe they are getting 343 pages of Rugby World Cup 1995 as distilled through the pen of an erudite Englishman. The Englishman, Charles Jacoby, is indeed erudite, but this is a rugby book with a distinct dearth of descriptions of the sweaty activities that make up the game for men with odd shaped balls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, Jacoby takes us on a colourfully recorded seven-month trip through 18 African countries, from Morocco to South Africa, with a continent's worth of variety and adventure in between. That was not to be, but it does not stop Jacoby and friends - Red Walsh, army-type George Wilson-Fitzgerald and Emma Tindal, a photographer - from having the time of their lives taking on Africa in a dilapidated Land Rover. But In Search of Will Carling is not always a witty romp.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is an horrific description of watching a man beaten to death by his fellow villagers for allegedly stealing from the tourists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the book is driven by the clich_ of The Englishman Abroad. But Jacoby, a prize- winning journalist, is too perceptive a writer to allow too much contemplation of his and his companions' Anglocentric navels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The precarious navigation of a police road- block in Zaire exemplifies his wit. &quot;They told us to hand over our papers. We gave them a packet of cigarettes. They agreed that our papers were in order, but they said we would have to go back into town and visit immigration. We gave them a pair of sunglasses. They said they thought there was a possibility that immigration was asleep ... They said he could be woken up. We gave them a sachet of self- tanning lotion ... Could they raise the barrier now, please? They looked at it. Oh yes. The barrier. There was something else, though ... a solar-powered calculator, yes, that was it. Up went the barrier and they gave us a smart salute as we raced off.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Courageous anti-apartheid publisher Ravan is no more. A tribute to those who first published JM Coetzee and others</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ravan Press has finally closed its doors. Not even the name could be saved as it was swallowed by Hodder &amp;Stoughton Educational. It's no use mourning the loss - it was bound to go sooner or later. Like its kin among the NGOs, the legal resource centres, the independent unions, the new-left academics, the alternative press and the black consciousness movement, it was a child of a very special time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone has now grown up and left home. Some have risen high; others have fallen. In their different ways they did amazing things, but the times have changed the order of action and the intense, creative and dangerous openings of the 1970s and early 1980s have closed. Big capital, long-term planning and strict accounting have taken the place of hunch, energy and networking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ravan was a remarkable invention that changed the meaning of books for a generation of South Africans. It was a child of the Christian Institute; born in the moment of Spro-Cas, suckled on foreign money, and brought up to defy the proscriptions of apartheid. In its early days, it showed its ecclesiastical colours fairly prominently -- in 1972 Rick Turner had to filter his argument for participatory democracy and socialism through the meshes of Christian conscience, not because he was a Christian but in order to show his respect for the team he was in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it wasn't long before Ravan began to make some unexpected moves. In 1974, in a moment of inspiration, it published Dusklands, JM Coetzee's first, astonishing, novel, and at a stroke entered publishing history forever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1977, when Mike Kirkwood took over, Ravan came out of the cloister and began to mix it in the cultural and political market place. It gives one an odd quiver to remember that Walter Felgate played midwife to the transition from ecclesiastical to demotic. The picture remains murky to say the least, but rumour had it that he was running messages and money between Gatsha, the Exiles and the Big Bankrollers of the opposition. Ravan fitted into the picture somewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kirkwood brought some big ideas that he had thought out in Durban while editing Bolt - a quirky little literary mag which once sported a Paul Stopforth cover of Harry Oppenheimer as Count Dracula (Anglo promptly withdrew their subs). Bolt didn't live long, but it seeded the ideas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first of them was that there was a surge of writing in the black townships that was not making it to the magazines, the bookshops or the street. The second was that the maverick academics, especially the Marxist historians, not only had great things to say about the country, but also made for better reading than most novels. The third was that there were a whole lot of intelligent people who could be writers if they were just shown how.  Ravan was the place where he began to test these ideas out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each of them, in its way, was winner. Staffrider shook the world of literary magazines and introduced a whole generation of black people to the strange pleasures of seeing themselves in print. Kirkwood proclaimed that he would publish anything literate he got, and he stuck to it. The flood proved him right, but the row about falling standards was deafening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The academic idea was right too, but it took longer to prove. Jeff Guy, Charles van Onselen, Jeff Peires, Peter Delius, Phil Bonner et al - one by one the London School of Oriental and African Studies doctorates made their way to the shelves - and they sold. It wasn't only history - sociology, contemporary political analysis, cultural studies of one kind and another, along with poetry and novels. In 1983 Ravan published an unheard-of 5 000 hardback copies of Coetzee's Life and Times of Michael K. The Booker Prize saved the day - they sold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third idea was perhaps the most daring. Unknown people were enticed, even wheedled into the business of starting to write. The most dramatic success was Marguerite Poland, whose first children's story The Mantis and the Moon, the editor maintained, was the best thing Ravan had ever published.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alongside her were writers like Miriam Tlali and Mtutezeli Matshoba, both of whom responded to the persuasions of the editor. It would probably amuse Studs Terkel to know that it was Working, his book of reportage, which stood behind both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A different kind of initiative grew out of the belief that a tradition of black prose was anchored in Sol Plaatje, and the republication of Native Life in South Africa and Mhudi, together with the Brian Willan biography, was an act of obeisance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This made the connections with key contemporary writers like Chabani Manganyi and Njabulo Ndebele. The tradition got a new turn from contact with Yashir Kemal's Anatolian Tales, which nourished both the fiction of Fools and, later, the theory in The Rediscovery of the Ordinary. Kirkwood was pushing Kemal after reading Walter Benjamin's essay The Storyteller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the mid-1980s the wave of quasi-religious enthusiasm for direct democracy broke on Ravan. It promptly installed a collective in the editorial seat, with the usual dismal results - a steady rise in backstabbing and a steep fall in output.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rumours of fisticuffs began to circulate and the team started to break up as the financial base crumbled. Kirkwood left the country, and it was eventually left to Glenn Moss to weld the fragments into a stricter and more modest operation. While Ravan was on the way down, others were making their way up. Skotaville had already captured the black consciousness field and the Congress of South African Writers rose to embrace the Mass Democratic Movement; together they cleaned up the donor pool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ad Donker remained sniping from the side and the nightmare of tumbrils woke David Philip; Witswatersrand University Press began to take the academic material and even the mainstreamers like Heinemann and Longman realised that the market had moved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was really only a matter of time. Monica Seeber was the last editor left, with only the Faulknerian role of trying to protect the corpse from the vultures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dead Ravan has one last big contribution to make: to let some really good historian into the archives to tell the full life and times of the bird and the book. It might just make the best book of the whole lot.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Tu Nokwe has released her second album.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I can't take jazz musicians, they criticise so much. And I used to listen to a lot of jazz as well as mbaqanga ... but all you do is get insecure around jazz musicians. They think they own music, you know!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The person speaking is Tu Nokwe, a woman who's been involved with music ever since she was a child and who has just released her second album, Inyaka Inyaka. . Sporting traditional dress for the launch of her album, a delicate string of beads is looped across her face between her nose and ear studs, as she talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her family home in KwaMashu, KwaZulu-Natal, literally pulsated with rhythm and harmony. Both parents were musical and &quot;there were always musicians in the house. Gibson Kente and his artists were always practising there.&quot; As was pianist Bheki Mseleku, the most successful South African jazz artist around today, who's been a family friend for 17 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He used to practise like a fanatic in our house. You'd go for a glass of water in the middle of the night and there he'd be - still playing at 3am.&quot; Indeed, now teaching at the University of Natal, Durban, he's still like that, she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her father, Alfred, was in jazz swing bands of the 1950s and 1960s and her mother, Patty, was a mezzo soprano. It was she who taught all her children to sing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alfred was also much used as a master of ceremonies and soon he was bringing along his singer daughters, Tu and Maralyn, with their friend, Nonhlanhla, who dubbed themselves the Black Angels. At the height of apartheid a name like that would've been enough to cause apoplexy in the Dutch Reformed Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And out of the singing group grew the Amajika Youth project, &quot;teaching kids drama, dance and self-respect&quot;. Seven members of the first class went on to join Mbongeni Ngema's Sarafina, including Leleti Khumalo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nokwe recently brought the Amajika school up to Johannesburg, where it ran in the Smal Street Methodist Church. There were courses in morals, music reading, singing, dancing, acting and &quot;really just in freeing yourself to be creative&quot;, she said. But she had to stop due to the demands of her album and her first baby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her new album, which also features the talents of Bayete producer/songwriter Thapelo Khomo and the band's lead singer, Jabu Khanyile, is a classy act, choosing musical delicacy over dancefloor beats and coming up trumps with tracks such as the superb duet with Khanyile, Ubuntu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A guitarist and songwriter, Nokwe has been busy on this album since 1992, with various remixes and post-post-productions. So no one can accuse her of rushing it. It includes the work of the late Princess Magogo, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's mother, a classical Zulu singer. Nokwe rearranged and rewrote two of her songs, Umelelwe and a love song, Isiqomqomane, now called River.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while Nokwe loves music, she never forgets its role in society: &quot;I think artists should be role models for the young, not just use their name for riches but teach and lead. Young people tend to listen to artists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, she adds: &quot;Why is it rich, famous artists often end up self- destructive? ... If artists don't use their fame positively, they will end up destroying themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The album deals with social issues such as crime and violence, and on the CD insert she invites people to write to her and respond to the lyrics. &quot;It's not just talk, I will answer the letters. I want to know how and what people think and what solutions they can suggest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She has called her three-month-old child Nirvana and the name accurately reflects mother's state of mind about her arrival. She was so determined to have a baby, she says, that she was actually interviewing men as prospective dads - with a view to non- involvement - before an ex-boyfriend reappeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the name also hints at her vegetarianism and spiritual beliefs. &quot;I try to live by a spiritual path, but I study different kinds of ways. I like the Quan Yin method, a quiet Chinese way of meditation and living in the world.  I've been doing different kinds of meditation for years but stayed with this because I didn't like vocalising my prayers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She's been vegetarian for 17 years, except for a short period of eating white meat, and she does yoga as well. Hardly your average KwaMashu girl. She is, she says, &quot;a bit of a world citizen ... I went to London by myself at the age of 17 and I learnt a lot.&quot; She's also spent a few years in New York at the Manhattan School of Music. Being vegetarian does get her into some delicate situations though, when it comes to things like ritual or celebratory sacrifices. But the ancestors, she says, &quot;are wiser now ... I think they understand new and different attitudes to animals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I was to have my baby, they were going to slaughter for me at home. I have to respect my family and their beliefs. They said to me that if there was karma involved it would be on them, not me and they did not expect me to eat the meat. So they respected me too ... I had to meditate hard on handling the old and the new.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - While prisons may no longer accuse people with artistic ideas of being &quot;pansies&quot;, and open their doors to a range of creativity projects, they most certainly do not want to pay for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've been forced to shut down,&quot; says Gary Friedman of Puppets In Prison. &quot; We've worked for the past seven months without any further funding and we can't go on.&quot; Friedman and his colleague Nyanga Tshabalala went to prisons five days a week for eight months this year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Puppets In Prison workshopped scripts with prisoners, who then made their own puppets and acted out and directed the dramas on Aids and related issues.  It was originally prompted by a request for Aids education from the Department of Correctional Services (DCS) and the pilot programme funded by the Department of Health, says Friedman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DCS, however, said in a statement this week that Friedman approached them in January this year suggesting a pilot - they did not commission the work. It also said the go- ahead for the project would only be given after the pilot had been evaluated for effectiveness and cost. And it was money that caused the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friedman proposed expanding his programme to a national level visiting all the prisons. He budgeted a cost of R5-million for five years, to equip 10 teams in all nine provinces. &quot;They said it was excessive but I don't think R5- million is a high cost to reach all the prisoners in the country with an ongoing, sustained programme.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His proposal was considered too expensive,&quot; says the DCS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department did not, says Friedman, even come back proposing a more modest programme, but simply rejected the project. The DCS denies this, saying Friedman was told if he came up with a more cost-effective programme it &quot;may reconsider his proposal&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An evaluation done by Aids expert Dr Clive Evian and Renee Bub, a programme evaluator, calls it an &quot;excellent initiative&quot;, in the light of a &quot;limited understanding of Aids, its means of transmission and prevention amongst the majority of prisoners&quot;, many of whom even doubt the disease's existence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't understand it,&quot; says Friedman, &quot;how can you ask for a programme, have it evaluated and find that it is really good and then dump it? It makes no sense to me. We got R90 000 for the pilot project, which we finished on April 3.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Elaine Rumboll's poetry workshop at Diepkloof Prison continues, despite its year-long Arts Alive funding running out at the end of September: &quot;Why aren't people helping with these projects? ... We're not charity workers and it's difficult work ... It's all very, very depressing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Funding of the arts will soon rest in the hands of a National Arts Council. A look at the cultural politicking ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a year after the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology commissioned the independent Arts and Culture Task Group (Actag) to compile an extensive report on how the arts should be funded in the future, the first draft of the new Bill - the National Arts Council Bill, 1996 - has been drawn up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stemming from the recent arts and culture white paper, the new funding model is a Lamborghini of democracy compared to the old banger of inefficient, elitist, non-diverse, eurocentric funding of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No more will the four Performing Arts Councils hog all the cash in order to stage countless productions of Swan Lake. In fact, the Bill intends to lay down such parameters as to ensure nobody hogs anything at all. Hail equity, diversity and enlightenment. Perhaps.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The guardian of the Bill will be the new National Arts Council (NAC) - directly, and the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology - indirectly. Like most other Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) initiatives, the model confuses the hell out of just about everyone, so here's a brief &quot;dunce's guide&quot; to how the structure should work:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The NAC councillors will be selected through a process of public nominations and open interviews. The councillors have already been shortlisted to 33 candidates (see below) and will be interviewed by a panel chaired by Constitutional Court member Justice Albie Sachs. The shortlist will thereby be reduced to between 14 and 22 names.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, Lionel Mtshali, will select between 9 and 14 NAC members from that list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Nine provincial representatives will then be added to the council. In the case of the four provinces which already have performing arts councils, the head of each of these bodies will automatically be elected to the council.  The rest will be selected through a process overseen by provincial MECs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The NAC will then appoint an unspecified number of advisory panels consisting of five representatives each, which will advise specifically on one field or discipline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It reads like a bureaucratic banquet - the sort that has the administration munching most of the food before artists so much as whiff the hors d'oeuvres.  Although the bill is fairly non-figure-specific, Actag representative Mike van Graan assures that the Actag report recommends no more than 15% of the total budget be used for administration. The remainder is to go directly into production and promotion of the arts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So how's the money going to filter through to the guy with a banjo and a dancing monkey? (Don those dunce hats.) For the first time, individuals, companies, non-governmental organisations and community-based organisations will be allowed to apply directly to the NAC for grants. However, Actag representative, artist Andrew Verster, has this to say on the matter: &quot; Artists all over the world stand on their own two feet, why shouldn't they here? ... The money will be put to best use promoting South African culture and raising public awareness of the arts.&quot; A somewhat vitriolic point of view from one rather well-off painter to his countless less fortunate contemporaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Graan contradicts the statement: &quot;Artists will receive most of the money, but there will also be money allocated to promoting the arts.&quot; Unfortunately, a step-by-step guide for artists on how to go about applying for grants, the criteria to be met and so on is not yet available as this will be decided by the not yet formed NAC itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who will the NAC and advisory panelists be? The Bill reads a little confusingly on this matter. First it states that the representatives will have &quot;specialist skills which are not directly arts related&quot;. It then goes on to say that they will be &quot;persons who have achieved distinction in the arts&quot;.  Deputy Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology Bridgit Mabandla attempted to clarify the matter by saying that both statements are true - ie the councillors will be made up of artists, administrators, lawyers, economists, educators and the like, but the advisory panels will be made up solely of experts in specific artistic fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though the performing arts councils will now have to share most of &quot; their&quot; golden cake (their budgets will be cut by about R10- million, R20- million and R30-million respectively over the next three years), Mabandla is eager to stress that the department has no desire to starve them to death: &quot; The established arts councils are national assets and will not be dismantled.  But now their productions will have to be competitive like the rest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One concern about the new budgeting is that spreading the already insubstantial pot of funding jam too thinly might result in a myriad of shabby productions or works as substantial projects will be unaffordable. &quot; That is a genuine concern,&quot; says Mabandla, &quot;because the budget isn't very big to begin with. But if artists have credibility through the NAC then they can look for further funding from the private sector more effectively.&quot; Mabandla went on to say that the NAC would need to become an attractive credential in order to sell the arts to business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Right now the model, which should be up and running by January 1997, looks interesting. Yet another highly sophisticated, superbly democratised structure to add to the RDP's highly sophisticated, superbly democratised, though arguably ineffectual bow. But whether the painstakingly fair process of actually handing out cash and then monitoring the output of recipients will be efficient, speedy and incorruptable we'll have to wade through several action-packed episodes to find out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public hearings of NAC candidates will take place on Friday, November 8 and Monday, November 11 at the Carlton Hotel in Johannesburg</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The full NAC shortlist:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HERE are the 33 names shortlisted for a place on the National Arts Council:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng: Professor Elize Botha (literature), Richard Cock (music), Mimi Coertse (opera, performing arts), Lisa Combrinck (literature), Vanessa Cooke (theatre), John Kani (theatre), Vicki Karras (dance), David Koloane (fine art) , Dr FJ Kok (arts administration, music, dance), Corinna Lowry (dance, choreography, dance administration), Don Mattera (literature), Professor Zakes Mda (drama, literature), Jerry Mofokeng (theatre), Zake Ngqobe (crafts), Norman Nossel (music, cultural sponsorship), Christopher Seabrooke (theatre production), Susan Sellschop (crafts), Christopher Till (arts administration), Mannie Manim (theatre, theatre administration), Mandie van der Spuy (arts and culture public relations)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western Cape: Ramzie Abrahams (education, museums), Omar Badsha (photography, visual arts), Marilyn Martin (architecture, arts administration, visual arts)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KwaZulu-Natal: Darius Brubeck (jazz, popular music), Linda Bukhosini (music, opera), Kessie Govender (drama), Nise Malange (literature), Gitanjali Pather (arts administration, art education), Kiren Thathiah (visual arts), Bongani Tembe (music, choral music), Professor Musa Xulu (music).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">North West: Memory Herholdt (music, dance)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Karen Skawras (visual arts - Gauteng) has withdrawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sweet And Sour</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Hazel Friedman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If nothing else, the otherwise lacklustre list of nominees for the National Arts Council suggests that the new thrones of cultural power will not reside solely in the kingdom of Gauteng.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the largest concentration of candidates inevitably comes from Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape come in second and third respectively, with a broadly representative, interdisciplinary line-up of nominees. Even the North West - where many believe (mistakenly) that the only form of culture is to found in the yoghurt - is represented on the shortlist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the sweetener. The less sanguine stuff is the fact that a mere hundred or so names were submitted from cultural organisations countrywide which even the selection panel agrees have been disappointing in terms of both quality and quantity. Now the number of candidates has been whittled down to 33 names shortlisted for a place on the most powerful cultural council ever constituted in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether the NAC will serve as an effective, truly transparent, funding facilitator for a sector that traditionally occupies the lowest rung on the government's priority ladder, remains to be seen. But already there are warning signals that what the NAC will achieve in terms of broad, countrywide representation, it might lack in terms of independence and vision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shortlist is dominated, predictably, either by unfamiliar names or by cultural stakeholders who have long had their fingers in a variety of cultural pies, such as the former director of culture for Johannesburg, Christopher Till, Pact chair John Kani and National Gallery director Marilyn Martin. While one of the prerequisites for an effective National Arts Council must surely be a proven track record, more maverick, outspoken and avowedly independent voices are surely needed to prevent the NAC from rubber- stamping only the tried, the tamest and the most politically correct of cultural projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also glaringly absent from the shortlist are cultural candidates from the larger universities, who will be sorely needed to provide the council with more detached, less culturally expedient, analytical input. Most of the other nominees will almost certainly have a direct stake in grabbing crumbs from the cultural funding cake, causing possible conflicts of interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will be up to the interviewing panel - chaired by Albie Sachs - to ensure that the public hearings for the NAC do not serve, inadvertently, as the initiation ceremony for access to a cosy club of smug consensus.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The ANC National Working Committee (NWC) which met in Johannesburg today, Monday 4 November, discussed among others the current situation in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NWC received a report that the involvement of the South African government in the situation was necessitated by the need to save lives of thousands of people in the region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was made possible by the lifting of the arms embargo in Rwanda by the United Nations to enable the new government to defend itself and prevent the recurrence of further genocidal activities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NWC also took note of the meeting of the Great Lakes Regional leadership and expressed the hope that this meeting will also help develop guidelines regarding the assistance which South Africa can provide to help achieve and maintain peace in the region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The suggestions that ANC members will not be applying to the Truth Commission for amnesty are devoid of all truth and malicious in the extreme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its submission to the Commission, the ANC delegation led by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki contended that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The morality of the ANC, its objectives and standards it set itself now and in the past dictate that we should examine the conduct of the struggle critically and acknowledged errors that may have taken place.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That the logic of the Commission is that the truth should be acknowledged, no matter how painful, so as to ensure that conditions are created under which it is impossible for any terrible things from the past to recur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To the extent that there may be questions on matters of detail, or the need for any elaboration on incidents perceived as gross violations of human rights referred to (in our submission), the ANC will make such additional input as is necessary. WHERE APPLICABLE, INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS WILL APPLY FOR AMNESTY&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, as the Head of the ANC Legal department, Matthew Phosa has indicated, efforts are currently underway to collect and collate information with a view to assisting members with applications for amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC reiterates its commitment to co-operate to the fullest extent of the law with the Truth Commission in an effort to help heal the nation of its wounds of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We appeal to the Truth Commission to have the courtesy of checking facts with ANC leaders before commenting on media reports which may bear no resemblance to the truth.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The ANC Western Cape is deeply concerned at the violence and loss of life which occurred during the protest at the Waterfront yesterday.  Our deepest sympathy is extended to the family of Mr Najaar who died during the protest. We also trust that those members of the SAPS who were injured are well on the way to recovery.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We call for an urgent investigation into the events which led to Mr Najaar's death as well as the damage caused to person's and property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC is on record as saying that the current mobilisation against drugs and gangsterism emerges from a genuine concern across all communities at the level of crime and the effect of drugs on our communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are convinced that the vast majority of those who joined PAGAD initially want to find solutions together with government and do so in a way which builds unity across all communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of recent demonstrations organised by a particular faction within PAGAD are not assisting in the fight against crime. Yesterday's demonstration at the Waterfront is a case in point. We support actions which take place in terms of the law. Clearly these bounds were exceeded yesterday and with disasterous consequences. These events serve only to alienate the vast majority of people who want to do something about crime. We cannot afford a repeat performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The anti-olympic bid slogans shouted at Minister Steve Tshwete and Ngconde Balfour raise serious questions about the motivation of those involved and confirms our view that there are elements within PAGAD who would want to turn genuine and popular sentiment against crime into an anti-central government campaign. This amounts to nothing other than opportunism. What makes it worse is that a genuine cause becomes discredited and lives are endangered in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC calls on all communities to build the community police forums and become active at street and neigbourhood level in the fight against crime.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - Urgent Appeal to African Heads Of State and Government</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Pierre Sane, secretary general of Amnesty International.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On behalf of Amnesty International, I am sending an urgent appeal to you as African heads of state and government meeting in Nairobi on 5 November 1996 to seek measures to prevent further massive human rights abuses in the Great Lakes region. The current crisis in the Great Lakes demands that you give priority to action which would end the human rights abuses which have caused the current crisis in eastern Zaire and are continuing throughout the Great Lakes region - not only in Zaire, but also in Burundi and Rwanda.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am appealing to you to adopt the following measures immediately:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Stop and prevent the transfer of weapons and ammunition to the armed forces, militia and other armed groups in Zaire, Burundi and Rwanda. The current human rights abuses in Zaire should be seen as a much broader pattern of atrocities carried out by all sides in the conflict along the Zairian border with Rwanda and Burundi. Regional governments have a crucial role to play in preventing the further transfer of weapons which would contribute to an escalation of human rights abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Recognize that years of human rights violations in Zaire, Burundi and Rwanda and almost total impunity for the perpetrators of these violations are at the root of the current violence racking the Great Lakes region. Make comprehensive proposals to all three countries to put in place a justice system which conforms to international standards of fairness and which ensures that those who violate human rights are promptly brought to justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Make it clear to the leaders of the Zairian security forces and to the Tutsi-led armed group and its supporters in Rwanda and Burundi that anyone responsible for ordering, condoning or encouraging human rights abuses will be brought to justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Remind those in charge of the security forces and of armed opposition groups that they have the responsibility to maintain strict chain-of-command control to ensure that officers and troops under their command do not commit extrajudicial executions or deliberate and arbitrary killings of unarmed civilians. Members of these forces should be reminded that they have the right and duty to refuse to obey orders to participate in such killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Seek immediate measures to protect all vulnerable groups in Zaire affected by the present conflict, including Rwandese and Burundi refugees and the local Zairian population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Demand that Zairian authorities and political leaders refrain from making inflammatory statements which are serving to incite members of the Zairian security forces and civilians to carry out violence against members of the Tutsi ethnic group. Similarly, demand that Rwandese government officials desist from making statements likely to fuel human rights abuses in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Seek independently verifiable guarantees from the Rwandese and Burundi governments that refugees who return to Rwanda and Burundi will not be subjected to human rights violations such as extrajudicial executions, &quot; disappearances&quot;, arbitrary arrest and detention without charge or trial in intolerable conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opportunity of this meeting should not be missed. Your role is indispensable in preventing further bloodshed in the Great Lakes region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Despite diplomatic efforts, the Kenyan government appears to have failed to convince Zaire to participate in today's regional summit on eastern Zaire. Early hopes that Zaire Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo would attend have proved false, which undermines the potential of the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire state-run radio said today that Zaire will not attend - on Monday it reiterated that its leaders will not attend any meetings on the crisis until &quot; the aggressor&quot; (Rwanda) has left the country. Kenyan government diplomatic efforts to persuade Kengo to attend were reflected in a statement by Froeign Affairs Minister Stephen Kalonzo Musyoka that Kenya expected representation even if the meeting began without Zairean representation. Musyoka acknowledged today that Kengo would not be attending (Reuters).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite fears of on-going fighting, the unilateral ceasefire declared yesterday by the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) is reportedly holding. BBC reports indicated that journalists and aid workers have begun taking advantage of the ceasefire to cross the Zairean border. Negotiations have not yet extended to the rebel ADFL. The BBC reported UNHCR's Ray Wilkinson as saying that aid agencies needed more than the ceasefire to cope with the humanitarian crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu is attending the heads of state meeting, along with host president Daniel arap Moi of Kenya. Tanzania's Benjamin Mkapa, Ethiopia's Meles Zenawi, and Eritrea's Issyas Aferworki had arrived by 12.00 noon (local time). Others expected are Uganda's Yoweri Museveni, Zambia's Frederick Chiluba, and Cameroon's Paul Biya - the current chairman of the Organisation of African Unity. Mediator in Burundi's civil war, former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere has also arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The failure of Kengo to attend is as likely to be interpreted as further evidence of his difficult political situation, as a reflection of Zaire's refusal to negotiate. Kengo is under pressure to resign, with opponents focusing on his part-Tutsi origin to associate him with the eastern Zaire crisis. The transitional parliament last week summoned Kengo to explain his conduct of the war publicly, and recommended that anyone of Tutsi origin be expelled from public service employment. (There have also been attacks on ethnic Tutsis living in Kinshasa).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kengo was voted into office in 1994 as a &quot;compromise candidate&quot; by the transitional assembly, after seven other prime ministers fell from grace during domestic and international pressure for a &quot;democratic transition&quot; in 1990. Kengo's attempts to reform Zaire's economy stirred domestic resentment but blunted international criticism - and he continued to command sufficient backing from President Mobutu Sese Seko. President Mobutu still enjoys a majority in the transitional national assembly, and is described by many journalists and analysts as &quot;the sole symbol of national unity&quot;. Successful regional and international negotiations will depend on who Kengo is seen to represent and whether he has sufficient political power to influence the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan representative, President Pasteur Bizimungu, is Rwanda's official head of state. Rwanda continues to deny reports that Rwandan soldiers crossed the border into Zaire during the fighting; Zaire accuses Rwanda of supporting rebels and crossing the border. Rwanda insists on describing the crisis as an &quot;internal Zairean crisis&quot;. This was underlined by initially chosing Rwandan Minister for Rehabilitation and Social Integration to attend the summit (with the Rwandan Foreign Minister attending the pre-summit meeting on Monday).  Both Rwanda and Zaire have said the issue of borders and colonial territorial boundaries should be discussed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zairean government acknowledged in a statement released on Monday in Kinshasa that it was no longer in control of Goma and Bukavu in eastern Zaire.  An anti-government student demonstration scheduled for today has been banned, and state radio on Monday said that troops had been ordered to open fire if it went ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are a number of UN and international diplomatic initiatives planned and in action, including: UNHCR's Assistant High Commissioner Sergio Vieira de Mello dispatched to Kigali; an Organisation of African Unity peace mission (arrived in Kigali from Kinshasa yesterday); UN Special Mediator Raymond Chretien due in France tomorrow; and a scheduled meeting of the European Union and international humanitarian organisations in Brussels on Thursday (November 7th). The United States State Department has pointed to the UN to &quot; take the lead&quot;, but no UN organisation has been appointed to date to lead and coordinate humanitarian initiatives. There was hope that today's regional summit would be one of the first productive initiatives in the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from the concern over disputed territory, the conflict includes crucial issues relating to the Rwandan genocide of 1994. In a paper issued November 4, Oxfam states a long term political settlement must include &quot;an end to impunity in the aftermath of genocide and atrocities across the region&quot; . Many of the refugees now fleeing fighting were either directly implicated in the genocide, or have been under the control of armed Interahamwe militia and former Rwandan army (&quot;exiled&quot; Hutu extremists). Failure of the international community to stop the genocide remains an issue with the Rwandan government; and sharp divisions of opinion relating to events in Rwanda will be a factor in the regional and international response - as well as the conflict itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One UN official told IRIN that there were fundamentally two different policies being advocated - one focusing on providing assistance to those in need in Zaire, and the other as getting the refugees back to Rwanda. The humanitarian players in Nairobi are mainly focused on needs, and the Rwandan government lead the &quot;return&quot; approach. According to the UN official, those who feel the conflict arises from the failure to resolve the 1994 genocide situation, generally feel that the loss of significant numbers of lives to fighting and lack of assistance is &quot;inevitable&quot; and possibly &quot;the price to pay for a resolution&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also considerable difficulty for aid organisations, journalists and diplomats to match information from Rwanda with information from Zaire - which suffers from poor communications and is relatively inaccessible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are reports that two personnel from a Medecins Sans Frontieres (Holland) mission are stuck on board a boat on the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika. They were unable to reach their destination, travelling to Kalemie (Zaire).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington, DC - A human catastrophe is unfolding in eastern Zaire where up to a million Rwandan and Burundian refugees and Zairians have fled intensive fighting. These people are without protection, food, shelter or water, and may be joined soon by an even greater number if the war continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women are especially vulnerable to the present violence and insecurity.  Despite the enormity of the tragedy in Eastern Zaire, it is only one aspect of a wider crisis of poverty, suffering and insecurity across Central Africa.  There is imminent danger of a wider war unless the regional governments and rebel movements, with decisive assistance from the international community, act to reduce tensions and attack the root causes of the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with the International Red Cross, Oxfam has evacuated from Bukavu, South Kivu, as the fighting is preventing any relief work. The lack of humanitarian activity and particularly the absence of the Red Cross leaves the people of this region without any form of protection. No humanitarian agencies have received replies to demands for guarantees of security and access to vulnerable populations. Aid agencies have lost contact with over a half million refugees. In North Kivu, the UNHCR has reported that 715,000 refugees in the region have fled westward as Tutsi rebels have taken over the town of Goma.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oxfam is painfully aware that the situation across the region is extremely complex, and that no simple solutions to the crisis exist. However, the scale of the unfolding suffering demands a rapid but considered response. This short briefing outlines what, from our experience across the region, we believe are the urgent steps which need to be taken to re-establish protection and humanitarian assistance for the victims of violence. The briefing also suggests ways in which the root causes of the crisis across the region have to be addressed if attempts are to be made to avert a far greater human calamity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our Ability to Meet Humanitarian Needs (Access)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are an estimated 700,000 people displaced by the current fighting.  There is now genuine concern that over one million lives are at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Policy Recommendations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- UN Special Envoy Chretien with the backing of the UN and OAU should undertake immediate negotiations with all parties to the conflict including the Zairian government and army, the Zairian provincial authorities, and the Banyamulenge and Banyarwanda, to establish a ceasefire, security for humanitarian activity in the region and safe corridors to help with the delivery of aid and the voluntary repatriation of refugees. All efforts should be made to convince the parties to the conflict of the need to uphold the Geneva Convention, and crucially to guarantee full access of the ICRC to assist the victims of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Currently the Zairians displaced in North and South Kivu have no assistance or protection. The UN Secretary General must extend the mandate of the UNHCR to cover the displaced Zairian people who are suffering alongside refugees in Eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- To ensure humanitarian efforts are effective, the UN Secretary General should appoint a regional humanitarian coordinator, with a strong support team, to guarantee the collaboration and coordination of humanitarian activities to maximize its benefit for the victims of violence. The regional humanitarian coordinator should coordinate with the UN Special Envoy to ensure humanitarian assistance is a part of a wider political strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Primacy of a Regional Political Settlement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international policy vacuum which exists around the Great Lakes region is a major contributor to the current crisis. Humanitarian aid has masked the systematic neglect of the international community to assist the regional governments in reaching a regional political settlement. Oxfam has long advocated sustained and concerted action by the international community to promote a political settlement between the governments of the region. We have been persistently disappointed with the response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the governments of the region made dramatic progress on preventing an escalation of the crisis in Burundi, they now face the momentous task of creating a long term regional political settlement which will have to address the underlying causes of the region's instability including:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- The need for justice and an end to impunity in the aftermath of genocide and atrocities across the region. This will include strengthening the Rwandan judicial system and the International Tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Tackling poverty through economic rehabilitation and regeneration as a first step to returning security and a livelihood to the people's of the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Dealing with repatriation as a political issue requiring the arrest of the authors of genocide and the intimidators of refugees in the camps, funds for secure repatriation and an acceptance that a small number of refugees may never return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Developing regional agreements on nationality, citizenship, residence status and economic migration which is a permanent feature of the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Moving to prevent the build up of arms and the tolerance, by governments, of bases of armed organizations determined to destabilise neighboring territories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Building responsive and accountable governments which reject the traditional politics of exclusion and seeks to represent the whole of society including the interests of minorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Maintaining emergency preparedness and humanitarian assistance and protection of people's basic rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(For further details see Rwanda: Never Again, The Search for Durable Solutions in the Great Lakes Region, Oxfam International, April 1996).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reaching a regional political settlement becomes ever more urgent as the threat of further political disintegration increases, and with it, identifiable and credible negotiators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Policy Recommendations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- The UN and OAU should use all the diplomatic opportunities available to them to support Ambassador Chretien, the new UN special envoy, to assist the parties to the current conflict to achieve an end to the fighting and to assist governments of the region to establish a process to reach a regional political settlement over the next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- The UN and OAU must make a public commitment to provide the resources and political will to sustain their cooperation and collaboration with this negotiation over the next year, and the implementation of the negotiated settlement well into the next decade. Without the security of long term cooperation by the international community there can be no hope of sustaining the slow and arduous climb back from calamity in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- The momentum built by the regional governments for dialogue between all political parties in Burundi must be maintained and supported by the international community. This process not only represents a vital precedent of regional political cooperation for mutual security, but also, if successful will take considerable pressure off eastern Zaire where currently Burundian armed opposition operate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Role of Development Assistance and Donors</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This latest war is a further indication that economic and developmental assistance to the region will only be effective and sustainable if it assists a regional political settlement. Donors must act in concert to design their co-operation to encourage regional actors to find a negotiated regional political settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Policy Recommendations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Call an urgent conference of donors, with the OAU, to establish common goals and strategies for assistance to design programmes which promote a regional political settlement between the governments in the Great Lakes. Aid and trade cooperation should be designed to promote a common material interest in stability and conflict resolution in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- The principle donors should instruct their executive directors to the IMF and World Bank to seek an approach by these two institutions which is coherent with donors' common strategy to promote a regional political settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plans for Repatriation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although, at this time, there is every indication that Rwandan refugees in Zaire are not repatriating even when they are caught in intense fighting and have no access to humanitarian relief supplies, it is important the international community provides every opportunity for them to return to Rwanda. The establishment of a cease-fire and safe corridors will be important in doing this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Policy Recommendation:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Establish safe corridors for refugee return. Help break the hold of the former regime on the refugees by detaining those implicated in the genocide.  In addition it will be important to ensure the refugees have access to accurate information about their home communities, and funds are provided for rehabilitation and reconstruction in Rwanda to create the conditions for return.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Details of killings are emerging as journalists take advantage of the first day of the ceasefire declared by the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalists in Goma report that local members of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have collected more than 400 bodies and are burying them in mass graves near the airport. Most are believed to be civilians, although some are described as wearing items of military uniforms. The dead include women and children. Local aid workers are reportedly prevented from moving out of town to get to refugees - and sporadic gun fire has been heard (although the ceasefire is described as &quot; largely holding&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports concerning the condition of Burundian returnees arriving in Gatumba from eastern Zaire include 52 non-accompanied minors handed into the care of UNICEF and UNHCR. In a camp of approximately 12,000, there have been ten deaths, and MDM reported on Saturday that 95% of their medical consultations have severe bloody diarrhoea.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A UN official confirmed to IRIN that bodies continue to be washed up on the shores of Lake Tanganyika (near Bujumbura), and said he found two bodies yesterday (Monday) - a man and a woman. He said the woman's hands and feet had been bound and twine or hemp was still tied to her wrist and ankles.  According to the UN official, local people say they have buried many bodies over the last week. Reuters also reports evidence of violent deaths on corpses washed up at the mouth of the Rusizi River (running into Lake Tanganyika).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following leaders attended the regional summit today: President Benjamin Mpaka (Tanzania), Prime Minister Meles Zenawi (Ethiopia), President Issayas Afewerki (Eritrea), President Frederick Chiluba (Zambia), President Yoweri Museveni (Uganda) and Secretary-General of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) Dr Salim Ahmed Salim. President Pasteur Bizimungu of Rwanda attended - but there was no representation from Zaire or from the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL). The summit began with an informal lunch at President Moi's official residence in Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a press conference given by Bizimungu on Monday, he said there were three fundamental issues to be sorted out - the legal and political programme of Zaire and the denial of citizenship to the Banyamulenge; the former Rwandan government army and militia who he said were armed and fighting alongside the Zairean troops, and should be denied refugee status; and, thirdly, the humanitarian crisis of scattered refugees threatened by starvation. He called on all Rwandan refugees to come back to Rwanda. Rwandan Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana said today that Rwanda was opposed to any military intervention for humanitarian purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Burundi, state-run radio carried an interview with Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Leonidas Havyarimana, on Monday, who complained that Burundi had not been invited to the regional meeting in Nairobi (today). He said Burundi, as a neighbour and an affected country, should have attended if a regional solution was to be found (Burundi remains under regional sanctions, imposed after the July coup). Burundi says it is concerned about the implications of opening corridors. Rwandan opposition group Rally for the Return of Refugees and Democracy in Rwanda (RDR) sent a memorandum to the regional summit saying that fighting in eastern Zaire is backed by Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda and is aimed at the Hutu refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mobutu of Zaire is in France and says he will return to Zaire &quot;in a few days&quot;. Press sources claim he was forced to leave Switzerland when, embarassed by his presence, the Swiss government refused to allow him to act in an official capacity or issue statements. UN Special Envoy Raymond Chretien will met Mobutu on Wednesday in his French Riviera villa. Mobutu has ruled Zaire for 31 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BBC reported that President Moi is believed to have received a communication from Kengo wa Dondo as to why he could not attend, and also reported that President Mobutu has been in direct contact with a number of African leaders since arriving in France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An anti-government student demonstration went ahead in Kinshasa today despite threats by the government that troops would open fire. A BBC reporter in Kinshasa described the capital as &quot;tense and chaotic&quot; with groups of soldiers in the streets; and speculated that Mobutu would return to his home rather than directly to the capital in the next few days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zaire Government says it has sent the presidential special advisor on security matters, Mbanda Nzamboko Atumba, on an African diplomatic tour to explain its position on the conflict (state-run radio, Monday). Also by radio, the government accused the USA of assisting &quot;aggressors&quot;, alleging US patrol boats supplied to Rwanda and Uganda for non-military purposes were used in the fighting. In Zaire, there are reports of tension in other regions of the country. Reuters report that troops have been moved into Mbuji-Mayi, the centre of Zaire's Kasai diamond mining region (diamonds have become Zaire's main foreign currency earner). Kasai (west of the disputed eastern Zairean region) has used different currency from the rest of the country since 1993 and is considered a &quot;hotbed of opposition&quot;. Regions such as copper-producing Shaba and Kasai are described as enjoying de facto autonomy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN Security Council is due to hold consultations today (Tuesday) about the humanitarian crisis, but is not expected to discuss plans for military intervention. Britian, France, Belguim and Italy all support the idea of humanitarian corridors; France is reported to have called for an urgent security meeting to be held between its African, North American and European partners to set up corridors that would guarantee the provision of aid under the eye of foreign troops. France and Spain have called for the use of military intervention. The British government on Monday said it was cautious about the creation of a multinational force to protect civilians, said to be advocted by France. French Foreign Minister Herve De Charette has called for &quot; security forces&quot; to channel aid through humanitarian corridors. A British foreign office spokesman said London was seeking more details about the French proposal, and said it would be essential for any military deployment to be under UN auspices. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said today that Germany would find it &quot;very difficult&quot; to deploy troops in Zaire, but said foreign involvment was necessary. He called on the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) to act (OAU is generally seen as not having the capacity to influence conflicts).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa reports it is under increasing pressure to take an active role in resolving regional conflicts, and asked for observer status at todays regional summit in Nairobi. The South African government is reportedly split over the arms contract with Kigali - with Mandela insisting that Rwanda has a right to defend itself against the continuing threat of exile Hutu extremists - and has decided to wait for the outcome of today's summit. Mandela was quoted today as saying he would scrap arms sales to Rwanda if so appealed by leaders at todays regional summit; but tacitly rejected appeals from the international community (notably Amnesty International) to stop the deal, by saying he would only listen to those &quot;involved in the situation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other diplomatic initiatives include a US envoy, Ambassador Bogosian who will travel to Rwanda and Zaire to hold talks with both governments (Monday) and US State Department said US envoy Howard Wolpe would be attending today's regional summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eye-witness accounts from journalists crossing the border into the rebel- held towns in Zaire report incidents of ill-discipline and violence by the rebel ADFL. Ten western clergymen were taken hostage on the outskirts of Bukavu, in rebel-held eastern Zaire, according to the Belgian foreign ministry. There is no information on who is holding the clergymen (Canadian, French, German and Belgian).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies launched an appeal today for $10.4 million to assist 500,000 refugees. &quot;The only thing we are sure of is the enormity of the crisis and the grave potential risks for refugees,&quot; said East Africa Delegate Christer Aqvist. The IFRC said that 1,300 Zairean Red Cross volunteers are still working in Eastern Zaire under very difficult conditions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durban - Transcript of remarks by Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Dr Alex Boraine on the issue of ANC applications for amnesty, at a news conference in Durban, November 4, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ARCHBISHOP TUTU:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chairperson of the Commission has indicated that if the position that has been delineated by the Premier of Mpumalanga were to be accepted as ANC policy, then we would... have to be looking for another chairperson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first point to make is that there is no crisis as yet, because when I first discussed this with the President a week or so ago he made it quite clear that the position expressed by Mr Matthews Phosa was a view held by some people; it was not ANC policy. I spoke with him again last Friday and he said the ANC was going to be making its decision today.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point again there -- and it is an important point to make -- is that all of us do make moral distinctions about the nature of force or violence.  When a woman is threatened with rape and happens to have a gun, and pulls it out and kills the rapist, she may go scot-free in court... But if someone wanting to hijack your car shoots you and kills you, that is culpable homicide. We all make that kind of distinction and there would be those of us who would say a struggle against an unjust system is a just struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You can make all of those distinctions, but in the Act there is no room for that kind of distinction to be made: amnesty is available for those who believe that whatever they may have done, or omitted to do, or whatever the offence, (it)... would attract a criminal prosecution or make them liable for civil damages. That is all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When you then get people saying, &quot;We as an organisation will decide that something that falls in the category of the just war -- or a justifiable war act -- we decide that we will not apply for amnesty for that,&quot; then my position is: why have a Commission at all? Because if one side does it, another side-- And as we know, some of these people who have come for amnesty say they were told they were in a war situation, and the things that they were doing would be war acts. If they also gave themselves amnesty, then they could just as well have given themselves general amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point is that if we allow the ANC -- if it does in fact take that position -- to get away with that, people would justifiably say, &quot;Ah, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is in fact a witchhunt. You are looking for people only from side really.&quot; As I say it is not yet a crisis, it will become a crisis should the ANC in fact decide that it wants to adopt that particular position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DR ALEX BORAINE:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just a quick point on what the Archbishop has outlined. First I fully share his concern, without qualification. Second it seems to me absolutely right that flowing from this possible major point of conflict, it would be sensible to try and have a meeting between the President, possibly the Premier of Mpumalanga and the Minister of Justice and ourselves, to thrash this out. It is so important that I think that ought to be taken up in our strategy and obviously we'll be looking at that...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION on whether the Archbishop had consulted the Commission before threatening to resign:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ARCHBISHOP:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I discussed with the Deputy Chairperson. I didn't seek to place colleagues, as it were... in a kind of invidious position. I did talk with Alex and we were in agreement about the principle. He doesn't think he agrees with me-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DR BORAINE: About the strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COMMENT BY DR BORAINE ON JOE MAMASELA:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We as a Commission therefore actually have got his name down as one of those whom we would want to subpoena in terms of Section 29, which is an in camera hearing...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a meeting last week, we decided to proceed with that subpoena. In view of the fact of the quite blatant public announcements (by Mamasela) which could hardly affect his role as a State witness -- because it's become public property -- we have decided that we would now do what we originally intended to do... The pressure from many, many people who were directly affected by the allegations is such that the Commission cannot forever go on being deaf to that, and so we have decided to proceed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COMMENT BY ARCHBISHOP TUTU ON RECENT CRITICISM OF THE TRC BY F W DE KLERK AND WESTERN CAPE PREMIER HERNUS KRIEL (as given to The Star, Johannesburg, and repeated at the news conference):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would want to say that Mr de Klerk and Mr Kriel ought to show a great deal more humility and speak with a great deal more contrition. If I were they I would probably shut up, I think.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are people who shouldn't in fact be saying anything. He (Mr de Klerk) knows that we have always asserted the evenhandedness of the Commission and its independence... Their spewings forth are very distressing because I would have thought they would be a great deal more humble.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Statement by spokesman Nicholas Burns at the department's regular news briefing on November 5 on the U.S. response to the crisis in the Great Lakes region of East Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States is deeply concerned by the situation in Eastern Zaire.  Fighting in Zaire's Kivu provinces between ethnic-Tutsi militia forces and Zairian military has escalated in the past 10 days, and resulted in direct confrontation between Zairian and Rwandan military forces. There is a risk this confrontation could provoke a wider regional conflict.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With more than 600,000 Rwandan and Burundian refugees being displaced from their camps in Eastern Zaire, the fighting has created conditions for a humanitarian disaster. Some of the displaced refugees have fled to the bush, where they are beyond the reach of international relief agencies. Many more have flooded into the Mugunga refugee camp, swelling its size from 200,000 to nearly 700,000. Proper distribution of available food stocks cannot be assured to sustain this population, and poor sanitation makes and outbreak of disease likely. Continued insecurity has led to withdrawal of all humanitarian aid workers from the region and made provision of food and other relief supplies impossible. In addition to its impact on the refugee population, insecurity in the region has also led to displacement of many Zairians, who may also require assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the outbreak of the fighting, the immediate priority of the United States has been to seek a cease-fire and negotiations among the parties involved. A cease-fire would not only stop the violence, but also create conditions in which humanitarian assistance and refugee repatriation could proceed. U.S. Ambassadors in the region continue actively to press the leaders of Zaire and Rwanda, as well as representatives of the non- governmental militia forces operating in Eastern Zaire, to end the fighting and agree to use their influence to stop the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secretary Christopher and Under Secretary Tarnoff met yesterday with U.N.  Special Envoy Chretien to discuss with the Ambassador the current security and humanitarian conditions in Eastern Zaire, to assure him of U.S.  government support, and to explore how the United Nations should respond to the crisis. The secretary asked Special Presidential Envoy for Burundi Negotiations Howard Wolpe to travel to Nairobi to consult informally with regional leaders during a summit meeting which is set to begin today, November 5. Rwanda/Burundi Coordinator Richard Bogosian will depart today for the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We strongly support the mediation efforts launched by regional African leaders, the European Union, and the United Nations. We are cooperating in each of these initiative to achieve our common goals of an immediate end to the fighting and creation of conditions to permit the delivery of humanitarian assistance and repatriation of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the humanitarian front, we have intensified contacts with United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata to address two immediate objectives: first the return of the maximum number of refugees to Rwanda; and second, the immediate humanitarian needs -- particularly at Mugunga camp.  Senior AID (U.S. Agency for International Development) and State Department officials met with Mrs. Ogata in New York October 30 expressly to discuss the current situation. A high-level White House and State Department team travelled to Geneva over the weekend for meetings with U.N. and refugee officials aimed at taking immediate steps to head off the potential crisis in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the United States Agency for International Development has sent its Disaster Assistance Response Team to the region to take the lead in preparing for U.S. relief activities. Senior White House officials met November 1 with representatives of American Private Voluntary Organizations that are active in Zaire to hear their recommendations for addressing the needs of the people affected by this situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. government is giving priority attention to the situation in Eastern Zaire. The U.S. response to the current situation builds on diplomatic initiatives over the past two years to support the Burundi peace process, to enhance the conflict resolution capability of the Organization of African Unity, and to encourage creation of an African Crisis Response Force.  The United States continues its ongoing efforts aimed at achieving a cease- fire and dialogue among the parties, responding to urgent humanitarian needs, and repatriating refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of September, we contributed $30 million to UNHCR in support of its assistance programs for Rwandan and Burundi refugees. Since the beginning of the crisis in late 1993, the United States has provided some $875 million in humanitarian assistance for the Great Lakes region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is according to the bank's latest findings contained in its monthly newsletter on economies in Africa and obtained by Zambia Information Services in Lusaka today.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, the privatisation programme made substantial progress between June 1995 and June 1996 resulting in the sale of a total of 137 companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report cites government commitment and consistency in the implementation process as the most important factor behind the success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Private sector dominance in the management of the Zambia Privatisation Agency (ZPA) is another factor that has contributed to the increased pace of privatisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZPA has 12 directors out of whom only 3 are appointed by the government and the rest are drawn from the private sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia embarked on the privatisation programme four years ago with the prime objective of stimulating economic growth through private sector-led investment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Bwalya said in Lusaka today that the final voters' roll was free from errors and challenged some opposition leaders who are misinforming the nation to the contrary to approach the electoral commission with concrete evidence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He woundered why politicians should misguide the public that there were ghost voters on the final voters roll because all initial related mistakes were corrected by the Israeli company Nikuv Computers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Bwalya found it most surprising that the same people scrutinize the voters roll at the election office and later leave without a comment only to hear them talking about concorted mistakes in the voters registers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When they come here to scrutinize the registers, they leave without any comment. It is thus most surprising to hear the same people talking about ghost voters and other errors supposed to be on the registers,&quot; Justice Bwalya said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And contrary to UNIP allegations that Nikuv computers Limited were now selling voters registers at 314, 000 United States dollars, Justice Bwalya said that only a national voters' register comprising 4,610 polling stations costs 9,150 United States dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the price list, voters rolls for a polling station costs only 2 US dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Bwalya said all parliamentary candidates including those from MMD had bought the voters registers for use in their constituencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He revealed that opposition political parties had earlier requested the government to buy the voters rolls for them but the government declined because the voters rolls were too expensive.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Mr Mwaba stated that the commission was considering setting up refugee camps in northern province because it was expensive to transport refugees to Solwezi in north-western province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is becoming expensive to transport the refugees to Solwezi and if the number of refugees increases, we shall consider setting up a camp in northern province&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - President Frederick Chiluba, who has temporarily broken off his re-election campaign, has arrived in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi to render support to the initiative by regional countries seeking the end of fighting in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Chiluba touched down at Jomo Kenyatta international airport at 10.  15 hours(8:15 GMT) Zambian time and was met by host President Daniel arap Moi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa was first to arrive followed by Ethiopian prime minister, Meles Zenawi who flew on the same plane with OAU secretary-general Salim Ahmad Salim.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan President, Pasteur Bizimungu, one of the two pratagonists in the crisis also arrived before President Chiluba touched down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire prime minister, Kengo wa Dongo another protagonist, is keeping everyone guessing as to whether he is coming to represent his ailing President Mobutu sese Seko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the programme, Kengo was scheduled to arrive first at 07.30 hours Zambian time but by 10.00 hours he had not yet arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are conflicting reports here about his confirmation to attend the summit of eight regional leaders of Kenya, Rwanda Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Cameroun and Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one-day summit at State House here is expected to broker a ceasefire but with the failure by Kengo to arrive, one wonders how this will be achieved. Kengo was quoted in the local newspapers as having insisted that he will only attend the talks if Tutsi rebels pulled out of eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire is accusing the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan government of aiding the rebels called Banyamulenge but Rwanda denies the charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, international pressure is mounting on South Africa to halt arms sales to the Rwandan government to forestall a possible escalation of fighting in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President moi has since telephoned his South African counterpart, president Nelson Mandela to suspend arms delivery for a while.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Press reports here say, during the phone conversation, President Moi pointed out that it would be prudent for South Africa to suspend further sale of arms to Rwanda until Rwandan troops are withdrawn from the Zairean territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa is in contact with Rwanda to supply military hardware worth US$8.5 million dollars. Zaire says arms being used by Tutsi rebels are from South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International has made a similar call, saying that arms flows to Central Africa are being abused by the two waring parties in the Zairen conflict according to its secretary-general Pierra Save.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And 98 foreigners evacuated from violence in eastern Zaire of Goma have arrived in Nairobi on two flights from the Rwandan capital of Kigali. The first palne carried 87 people and 11 were on the second plane both arriving last night.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three-day meeting is also to promote new technologies in various services and the information needed to meet the growing challenges in the industry in West Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening the conference, the Gabonese minister of mining, energy and petroleum, Paul Toungui, said the Libreville meeting will strengthen economic and commercial ties between Africa and operators in the oil industry, sub- contractors and suppliers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said trends in the oil industry were promising in West and Central Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's oil production represents 10 percent of the world production, Toungui said, adding that the continent accounts for 6 percent of world oil reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged investors to concentrate on the region, which is a potential market in the world economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Libreville conference is being attended by participants from 10 of the 12 member countries of the Association of African Oil Producing Countries (APPA): Angola, Algeria, Benin, Congo, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Egypt, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Libya, Nigeria and Zaire.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - Ali Mazrui, the celebrated African author and scholar of humanities, said Monday that Africans would be better off if they accepted the ethnic nature of their societies and found constitutional mechanisms to accommodate their diversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Africans have been engaged in a game of denial of ethnicity,&quot; he said in a clear reference to the various ethnically-inspired social and political wars raging in many parts of the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yet this baby called ethnicity will not be here for just ten years. We will have it here for well over a hundred years.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mazrui, who is director of the Global Cultural Institute in the United States, is in Ghana as guest of the Pan-African Writers Association. He was delivering the association's inaugural annual lecture on &quot;The African Condition Since Kwame Nkrumah's Fall: 1966-1996.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first of Mazrui's two-part lecture was on &quot;The State And The Nation: The African Experience&quot; in which he dilated extensively on Africa's identity, problems, language, gender, military interventions and ethnicity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said with the probable exception of Ghana, the crisis of ethnicity had worsened in most parts of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to achieve ethnic harmony among Africa's heterogenous social groupings, he said, &quot;Africans should reconcile ethnicity with the new democratic dispensation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mazrui said such reconciliation must include the legitimate prevention of the formation of &quot;ethnically centered&quot; political parties and the introduction of language policies which can eventually engender a lingua franca or commonly accepted language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black Africans, he said, are caught between the linguistic divide of the West and regretted that the continent's best authors have had to write in foreign languages before they are accepted internationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On military interventions in Africa, he said: &quot;If Ghana is arguably the Great Britain of Africa, then, it seems more of a Great Britain with a Cromwellian tendency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is in reference to the political upheavals which characterized Oliver Cromwell's reign as King of England in the 15th century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, Mazrui conceded that although certain African countries may be characteristically &quot;coup-prone&quot;, the issue of military intervention in politics was a continental problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called for efforts to relax civilian-military tensions especially in coup-prone nations. He recommended, as an antidote, the experimentation of a two-chamber legislature of which a lower non-elective house would have seats for ranking army officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another alternative, he said, was to have a vice president who is a retired senior army officer but who cannot assume the presidency on the event of the president's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his perception of Kwame Nkrumah, Mazrui described Ghana's first president as &quot;a king and philosopher, a writer with a vision and a mission.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Mazrui insisted that &quot;Nkrumah was a very great African but not a great Ghanaian&quot; because his vision had more relevance to the African continent than to his home country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Some 40 international and local companies are bidding to buy Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, which is being sold by the government under the country's privatization programme initiated three years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambia Privatization Agency, which is charged with the supervision of privatization of state firms, said Tuesday that companies based in Canada, Australia, South Africa and the United States, have made bids.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others are from India, China, Japan, Belgium and Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation is bidding to buy the mines power division, jointly with Eskom, South Africa's main electricity generation and supply company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has said that it intends to have the mining company fully privatized by the end of 1998. The privatization agency has set February 1997 as deadline for submission of tenders by all prospective buyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International and local consultants hired by the government to study the best mode of privatizing the mining industry have recommended the sale of individual divisions to various bidders instead of as a single unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government maintains that privatization offers the best hope of resuscitating the industry which has been run down over the years, due partly, to under-capitalization and worn-out machinery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia's copper production has declined from a yearly average output of some 700,000 tons in the 1980s to an all-time low of 300,000 tons recorded in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Copper is Zambia's major foreign exchange earner, accounting for more than 80 percent of the country's foreign revenue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - A senior Zairean official warned Tuesday that the country would use force to remove what he said was the Rwandan army from eastern Zaire, who are aiding anti-government Tutsi rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngbanda Atumba, the special adviser to Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, said the Rwandans had to withdraw immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire has accused the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan army of helping the rebel army of 20,000, known as the Banyamurenge, fight Kinshasa's troops. The authorities in Kigali have denied the charge.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngbanda, speaking at a press conference in Lusaka, said that Zaire had captured 10 Rwandans who, during interrogation, admitted that they were government troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presence of these troops in eastern Zaire was non-negotiable, he added.  Therefore, Zaire would not attend Tuesday's regional summit in Nairobi to end the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will only sit in meetings with other countries after the Rwandans have been evacuated from our territory,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting between the Banyamurenge and the Zairean army has led to an exodus of Rwandan Hutu refugees from camps in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngbanda also blamed Burundi, with its largely Tutsi army, of helping the Banyamurenge in the current conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the the fighting in eastern Zaire was an ethnic war between Tutsi and Hutu refugees and that the minority Tutsi were determined to wipe out the Hutu majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngbanda, who spent half an hour explaining the history of the Banyamurenge, denied claims that these people were indigenous to Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the Rwandan refugees settled in Zaire at a place known as Mulenge after the 1920 exodus from Rwanda and in another mass exit during the Second World War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Banyamurenge are Rwandans who migrated to Zaire, including those who came after 1994,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngbanda is scheduled Wednesday to brief South African President Nelson Mandela on the situation in Zaire. He is also expected to meet with the leaders of Cote d'Ivoire, Gabon, Kenya, Nigeria and Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has already met with Presidents Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania and Frederick Chiluba of Zambia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The chairman of Zimbabwe's Hospital Doctors' Association, Farayi Jiah, has been arrested and junior doctors in Harare said Tuesday they are resuming their strike to protest against the police action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jiah, who is co-chairman of the unified Civil Service Negotiating Committee, was arrested around 1030 p.m. (2030 GMT) Monday at his home at the Parirenyatwa Hospital Doctors' Residence and charged with contravening the law and order (maintenance) act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the Highlands Police Station, where he is being held, Jiah told the Zimbabwe Inter-Africa News Agency that he was arrested by officers from the Criminal Investigations Department, whom he accused of denying him his right to call a lawyer.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the arrest has to do with the strike by nurses and doctors,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jiah, who is on leave and is conducting a study on AIDS, has been accused by several government officials of instigating the nurses into striking. He is to appear in court soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nurses and doctors went on strike on Oct. 21, pressing for better salaries and working conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the junior doctors returned to work three days later, meeting a government deadline to avoid dismissal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government announced that those failing to return to work by Oct. 29, would be fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However the majority of nurses, estimated at 2,000, ignored the ultimatum and are now demanding their terminal benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acting Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare Minister Nathan Shamuyarira said Monday the Public Service Commission -- which approves all civil service hiring -- had been instructed to send letters of dismissal to all nurses who failed to return to work Oct 29.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is the commission which should know how many nurses have been dismissed, &quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, several hospital wards, including the outpatient departments, at Harare Central, Parirenyatwa and Chitungwiza hospitals remain closed. There have been reports of people dying in and outside the major referral hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior nurses have also threatened to strike, complaining they can no longer cope with the pressure of work.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - A roundup of the latest news from and about Malawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MP GIVES VERBAL BASHING TO PRESIDENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition deputy for Karonga South, Kamunga Mwafulilwa, on October 27 took a swipe at President Bakili Muluzi for failing to install electricity into people's houses and public social facilities in his area in keeping with his promises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his address to the gathering at the commissioning of Wovwe mini- hydroelectric power station in Karonga, the Aford deputy told the president that he had not connected power to hospitals and schools in the area as he had earlier promised. Muluki had told the people in the area that he would not commission the power station until he had connected all the major public utilities with power in the area.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MP also accused the ruling party of trying to gain political mileage of a project that had been implemented by the previous regime. After speaking in the vernacular, angry UDF officials had to grab the microphone from Mwafurilwa when he wanted to translate what he had said in Tumbuka into English for the benefit of the Germans who were present at the function. The project was funded by Germany. A visibly angry Muluzi called on the MP to respect him saying his remarks were uncalled for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THREE KILLED IN AMBUSH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four unidentified gunmen on October 27 shot dead three people, including a woman, when they ambushed a Chibuku Brewery van in Nkhata-Bay, northern Malawi. Police said the ambushers were apparently after cash. It is believed the victims where unauthorised passengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MYSTERY SURROUNDS SOURCE OF MONEY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody in the UDF government wants to disclose the source of a K70 million fund that government has allocated to the Youth Loan Scheme. President Muluzi launched the scheme in August, but fell short of disclosing the source of the money as was expected of him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Muluzi's economic advisor Kalonga Stambuli and Principal Secretary for Youth, whose ministry will oversee the implementation of the project, said they were ignorant of where the money came from apart from merely saying that it was a grant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRIBUNAL ACCUSED OF FAVOURITISM</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over 900 people from Mangochi, south Malawi who were victimised by the former regime and now want compensation, have accused the National Compensation Tribunal of favouring certain people in processing claims for compensation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cyril Siliya, spokesman for the people, most of them from Moto village, home of the late Masauko Chipembere who rebelled against Dr Banda during a 1964 cabinet crisis, said there were a lot of irregularities in sums of money paid out to victims, with some getting more than others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said while some people with political connections got hefty sums of money of up to K400,000, none of the victims from his district had been given more than K20,000. However, legal assessor and spokesman for the tribunal Viva Nyimba, said the payments being made now were only temporary and that the victims would be given real compensation when the tribunal had assessed the claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ELEVEN POLITICAL PARTIES FORM COUNCIL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eleven political parties, most of which fought together with the ruling UDF under the Common Electoral Group, have formed a united council to enable them to speak with a common voice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The formation of the group comes in the wake of growing dissatisfaction by the parties who feel the UDF has abandoned them in spite of their vital contribution in the fight for democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parties claim that the UDF is now eating the spoils of that fight alone, having completely forgotten the rest of the parties in the CEG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRIBUNAL COFFERS DRY UP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funds for paying victims of Dr Banda's 30 year autocratic rule dried up end of October, dashing the hopes of thousands of people who had submitted claims for an early compensation. The new government set up the tribunal in 1995 to investigate claims by victims and compensate them for the victimisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For 1995/96, the tribunal had requested K100 million (6.6m) but was only given 25% of that amount. Tribunal spokesman Viva Nyimba, confirming that hundreds of victims are being turned back empty-handed because there were no funds to pay them said, however, there was no need for anxiety as the government would soon replenish the coffers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DRUGS PRICES LIKELY TO DROP</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The price of drugs, which today is very prohibitive even if one were on a medical scheme, is likely to fall following recommendations that a special committee set up to probe the high prices for drugs in the country has recommended to government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee comprising representatives from the health and finance ministries and pharmacy and poisons board identified surtax and customs duty as the main cause for the high prices for drugs in the country. Surtax ad customs duty currently stand at 20% and 10%, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHILDREN DIE IN MEASLES OUTBREAK</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nine children have died of measles in Mulanje, south Malawi during the past two months prompting health workers to set up a vaccination campaign.  District Primary Health Officer in Mulanje, Veronica Limwado, described the situation as serious but said it was gradually calming down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five deaths occurred in September while the other four were recorded in October, out of over 131 cases reported in July. Officials said they are stepping up the vaccination targeting a population of 5,000 children aged between six months to 15 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PARLIAMENT ACCUSED OF BLOCKING 8000 JOBS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential Economic Advisor, Kalonga Stambuli is deadsure that a whopping 8000 jobs are out there in the informal sector waiting to be grabbed - if only the stalled parliament convened to amend the Customs and Taxation Act.  This bill, once amended, argues Stambuli, would usher in handsome investments to the exporting industry. He said that &quot;it would provide incentives that would make this landlocked country competitive to foreign investors&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stambuli, who thinks it is the opposition who are in the wrong for the failure of parliament to convene says they (the opposition) might think they are punishing the president by boycotting parliament, &quot;but it's the ordinary man who is now suffering.&quot; MCP and Aford are boycotting parliament in reaction against the president's appointment of cabinet ministers from the two parties without their consent which they view as being calculated at weakening them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nebert Nyirenda, Investment Promotion Manager at Malawi Investment Promotion Agency (Mipa), says his organisation is looking forward to the Finance Minister - who has been studying the recommendations - tabling the bill before the house anytime it convenes. &quot;We were given a picture that if all goes well it (the bill) would be tabled in parliament. It is expected that if the bill was passed, investments would by March next year have created the 8,000 jobs for unskilled labour.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - As the war rages on between tobacco growers largely under the umbrella of the Tobacco Association of Malawi (Tama) on the one hand, and the government and Tobacco Control Commission on the other over intermediate buyers, Malawi's main tobacco buyers have threatened to stop buying the country's tobacco because they are dissatisfied over the low volumes produced.  In spite of an increase in volumes this year, international buyers have voiced concern that for several years now, Malawi has failed to meet their desired threshold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tobacco sales this year registered an average 18.4% increase over last year's production due to a mix of factors among them higher volumes and better quality. The crop, dubbed Malawi's green gold, raked in a handsome K3, 553,620,000 ($236,908,000) in 1996, which was K552,285,000 over last year's production. The lowest hit were burley, which dropped from $190,228,000 in 1996 to $149,814,000 in 1995, flue-cured ($34,959,000) which went down by $2, 479,000 over last year's volumes and Northern Darkfired ($9,486,000 in 1996) from $12,730,000 in 1995.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prices also varied with some leaf fetching higher prices per kilogram than others. In spite of the lower volumes, Fluecured was the most highly priced at an average of $2.29/kg ($1.85 last year), Burley gained by an average $0.  13/kg over last year, while Northern Darkfired and Southern Darkfired got stuck at the same $1.70/kg. Sun Air on the other hand took a leap by $0.40/kg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data was not immediately available from the Tobacco Control Commission to compare with prices in other countries such as Zimbabwe. Tama's Executive Secretary, Dr. Gabert Thyangathyanga, an optimist through and through, says his organisation is poised to fight and eliminate intermediate buyers (IBs) until the last soldier is gone.&quot;IBs are thieves. They connive with tenants to steal from the farmers,&quot; charges Thyangathyanga. Intermediate buying, for a very long time a monopoly of the government-owned Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation (Admarc), which had the sole prerogative of controlling prices, was introduced on the behest of the International Monetary Fund under the economic liberalisation policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system is aimed at achieving equitable pricing of the crop to enable the tenants and the smallholder farmers, who were recently also allowed to grow burley and who could not hitherto benefit from the highly priced crops because they were limited to one buyer, that is Admarc, irrespective of the price the firm offered. There are now 3,000 intermediate buyers. However, Thyangathyanga says the system was imposed on the farmers overnight and without their say so and is aimed at destroying the tobacco industry, an evil he says his organisation will fight to the end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tobacco Control Commission General Manager Dr. Godfrey Chapola says his firm as a regulatory body only implements policy and does not take sides. He says government took the decision in the national interest, but the aim was not to damage the tobacco industry as claimed by Tama. &quot;That would be suicidal. Dissatisfaction in a normal setting is normal. What is important is economic development and equitable distribution of income,&quot; says Chapola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent analysts within the commission say government may lose the battle to Tama on IBs because of its unsteady representation during meetings.  They argue that the growers would like to keep IBs out the system, not because they are thieves as Thyangathyanga alleges, but because the IBs offer more competitive buying prices to tenants and thereby reduce the farmers' chances of ever exploiting the tenants. &quot;With IBs around, farmers can no longer cheat the tenants on prices because they will simply sell their tobacco to the IBs,&quot; one analyst said. With this competition, tenants are now able to sell their tobacco at as much as K12 to K15/kg and they are at liberty to sell or not sell to their masters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On low volumes of tobacco, Chapola says redress lies in putting in place an equitable pricing system, facilitating access by farmers to resources, and tied to the first two - opening up the industry in order for more people to grow the crop. The analysts say many growers have over the years abandoned Fluecured and Northern-Darkfired because of two reasons: the poor price for the crops, whose price has only changed by a meagre 50 US cents over the ten years since 1988. This has obviously made the crop unattractive. The other problem is the shortage of the wood fuel the two types of tobacco require for curing. They say the problem is compounded by the eucalyptus in blue-gum species, one of the fast maturing types of trees which is not suitable for curing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 1995/96 season, Malawi only managed to produce 115 million kg out of the 120 million that the buyers requested. Meanwhile, Chapola says the commission will only issue realistic and manageable quotas to growers and the total quotas to be issued will match the country's demand. Other analysts in the commission say to beat the 130 million kg that buyers have requested during the 1996/97 year, the commission will have to issue quotas for up to 200 million kg.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - European Union Special Envoy for the Great Lakes, Aldo Ajello, said today that three regional foreign ministers and a representative from the Organisation of African Unity will go to Kinshasa &quot;as soon as possible&quot; to present the Zairean government with the decisions of yesterday's regional summit. He said they would leave tomorrow (Thursday) at the latest.  Diplomatic efforts concentrate on securing Zaire's agreement to the resolutions, which include calls for neutral military intervention, the establishment of humanitarian corridors and temporary sanctuaries, and an immediate ceasefire. Neither the Zairean government or the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces (ADFL) were present at the heads of state meeting. The ADFL declared a unilateral three week ceasefire on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regional ministers will be trying to get Zaire to agree on a ceasefire and the need for international intervention. On Tuesday evening, Zaire's Information Minister and government spokesman, Boguo Makeli, denied there was rebellion on Zaire territory, saying that Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda were the aggressors. The Zairean government has acknowledged that it no longer controls Bukavu and Goma, but has not acknowledged the civil war. It has said it will not attend any regional meetings about the eastern Zaire crisis until the &quot;aggressors&quot; (referring to the alleged presence of Rwandan troops) are off Zairean territory.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a BBC report, a government spokesman in Kinshasa today said that Zaire would not take a position on military intervention until it was fully aware of the proposals made by the Nairobi summit. The spokesman said that Hutu refugees should return to their country of origin and territory should be restored to Zaire (implying foreign rather than domestic involvement). On the humanitarian aspect, the spokesman said Zaire was no longer prepared to accept assistance for the refugees on its own side of the border, and that aid should now be provided within Rwanda and Burundi and that refugees could pass through the proposed corridors out of Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu of Rwanda said today (Wednesday) that it was not necessary to wait for the approval of Zaire to go ahead with a proposed international force. He said it was up to the United Nations to call on Zaire to abide by the resolutions of yesterday's regional heads of states summit, and said the United Nations had the right to send in a force &quot;with or without the agreement of the country concerned&quot;. Rwanda insists on regarding the eastern Zairean conflict as an &quot;internal Zairean crisis&quot;. In an interview on the BBC, Claude Dusaidi, advisor to the Rwandan government, welcomed the Nairobi proposals, particularly the decision to assist separation of intimidators from the bona fide refugees. On the issue of corridors, he acknowledged the need to use them to initially feed the refugees, but said the aim should be to repatriate as soon as possible. He said an intervention force must be neutral.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Rwanda and Zaire seem to have accepted - to some extent - the idea of humanitarian corridors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad said today that the South African government has temporarily suspended the sale of arms to Rwanda.  President Mandela was quoted yesterday - after a personal appeal from Kenyan President Moi to suspend an 18 million arms deal - that he would suspend arms sales to Rwanda if requested by regional leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International responses to the regional summit have focused on the call for military intervention. US Special Envoy Howard Wolpe called the notion of an international presence &quot;helpful&quot;, but said the type of force envisaged needed to be discussed. British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind welcomed the idea of a multinational force and said it would be discussed at a summit on Friday with France. European Union officials also met on Tuesday in Brussels for talks on possible intervention in Eastern Zaire, and, according to Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Aldo Ajello, will meet on Thursday (tomorrow) to &quot; harmonise the position&quot;. He said European reaction had been very fast. .  Germany has raised the possibility of deploying UN military observers, particularly in the Zaire-Rwanda border. President Nelson Mandela has pledged South African support for a peacekeeping force, saying he would respond very positively to any request from the United Nations. The Johannesburg Star reports that South Africa has two fully-trained batallions ready to join any multinational peacekeeping force organised by the UN or the OAU. This is the first time South Africa has expressed a willingness to send troops on peace keeping missions. Togo has proposed a four-point ceasefire plan, saying it would prevent a &quot;second genocide&quot;; it is essentially the same as the decisions taken by the regional summit, incorporating a ceasefire, an neutral intervention force, territorial integrity and further talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said that a multinational force could be deployed &quot;in a very short time&quot; - France has led calls for military intervention since the weekend, along with UN High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata. Spain and France have said they are prepared to participate in a force for Zair. President Jacques Chirac - whose government is now host to the ailing Zairean president - underlined French support for Mobutu by saying the president was &quot;the man best placed to represent Zaire and find a solution to this problem&quot;. He says the force proposed by France and Spain needs the approval of the UN Security Council, would include US, European and African troops and could later be replaced by an African force with US and European backing. French support for Mobutu will be an issue for other actors in the conflict - particularly the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other reactions include plans for a special session of the conflict prevention team in the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) next week in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (the Central Organ of the OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution is composed of Cameroon, Algeria, Comoros, Congo, Ethiopia, Gabon, Guinea, Malawi, Mauritania, Mozambique, Nigeria, the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, Tanzania, Togo, Sudan, Zambia and Zimbabwe). The OAU says the meeting will be attended by the countries of the Great Lakes region, and other neighbours. Former French cooperation minister Bernard Debre proposed in an interview in a French newspaper the creation of a Hutu state, comprising &quot;a small part of Rwanda, Burundi, and also part of Kivu&quot;. Previously, proponents of creating separate ethnic states included President Moi of Kenya. An exclusively ethnic analysis of the regional conflict, including the 1994 genocide, is generally rejected by political players in the arena, who point to the fact that political groups and geographical areas are not ethnically &quot;pure&quot; (for example, rebel spokesman for the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo- Zaire (ADFL), Laurent-Desire Kabila is perceived as one of those leading the &quot; Tutsi revolt&quot;, but is from the mineral-rich Shaba region in southern Zaire).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action by Churches Together (ACT) has issued an appeal for the Eastern Zaire emergency for $4,757,947 to stockpile and deliver emergency relief supplies in Rwanda, Uganda and Kenya, from 1 November 1996 to 31 December 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight hundred Zairean soldiers who fled to Uganda early this week returned home, according to Ugandan security sources. They reportedly commandeered canoes on Lake Edward to get back into Zaire. There is a slow trickle of refugees into Uganda, mostly women and children; UNHCR put the number at around 9,500 and say the rate of arrival has decreased this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unpublished UN report on regional arms supply accusing Zaire of playing &quot; a central role&quot; in helping Rwandan and Burundi Hutu rebels to rearm on its territory, has been leaked to the press. According to press reports, Zaire was accused of playing a major role in &quot;huge webs&quot; of arms trafficking - &quot; Zaire, or elements within Zaire, appear to continue to play a central role as a conduit for arms supplies to and military training of Rwandan and Burundese insurgents on its soil&quot;, the report says. The report, likely to be that of the UN Commission of Inquiry formed in 1995, is also quoted as saying that Hutu militia in refugee camps of Zaire, Tanzania and (previously) Burundi were funding arms purchases from &quot;the sale of relief goods donated by international humanitarian organisations&quot;. The Zairean government denied these allegations on Tuesday night. After the 1994 Rwandan genocide, international human rights organisations drew attention to arms supplies to fugitive Hutu extremist groups in neighbouring countries. Paradoxically, at the time of declaring a ceasefire, the rebel groups - reportedly well armed - had managed to seize up to 300 kilometres of border territory in two weeks and resistance from ex-FAR and Interahamwe militia appears to have been minimal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Regional leaders on Tuesday called for the UN Security Council to take urgent measures to ensure the establishment of safe corridors in Eastern Zaire, and create temporary sanctuaries by deploying a neutral force. The Summit expressed &quot;grave concern&quot; at the deteriorating situation and the threat posed to peace and stability in the entire Great Lakes region.  Immediate needs were listed as a strictly observed ceasefire; commitment to the territorial integrity of Zaire, national boundaries and an end to cross- border incursions; and commitment to the inalienable rights of all people within internationally recognised territorial boundaries. This has been interpreted to refer in particular to the Banyamulenge's right to Zairean nationality. The leaders also called for intensification of efforts towards voluntary repatriation of refugees to Rwanda, and separation of &quot;the intimidators and bonafide refugees&quot;, referring to the exiled extremist Hutus from the Interahamwe militia and the former Rwandan army, who have controlled refugee camps since perpetrating the 1994 genocide.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attending the summit hosted by President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, were: Presidents Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, Frederick Chiluba of Zambia, Pasteur Bizimungu of Rwanda, Isaias Afewerki of Eritrea, Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania, Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia and Ferdinand Oyono, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Cameroon, representing President Paul Biya, current Chairman of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). The talks were also attended by OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim and former Tanzanian president, Julius Nyerere, mediator for the Burundi peace process. Burundi complained it was not invited even though it is an affected neighbour. There was no representative from Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decisions of the regional summit are seen by many as significant as they represent a regional consensus - excluding Zaire - in favour of military intervention. President Daniel arap Moi said it was important to get international backing for the decisions. Response from the Zairean government will be critical to implement the decisions. There was also no representation from the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo- Zaire (AFDL). Until yesterday, Rwanda rejected any sort of military intervention - and points still have to be clarified on the type of corridors created.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will be important clarifications to be made on how some of the decisions are implemented - like temporary sanctuaries, and how to separate bonafide refugees and the intimidators. Previous resolutions undertaken on separation have failed to take effect. Resolutions to intensify efforts towards voluntary repatriation to Rwanda must also be seen in the context that an extremely small number of the refugees have returned voluntarily to Rwanda to date, despite the considerable dangers and hardships now faced inside Zaire. The OAU has been asked by the leaders to &quot;closely follow up the implementation&quot; of the decisions, and work with the UN Secretary General.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some international aid workers are seeking to take advantage of the ceasefire and cross into rebel-held towns of Goma, Bukavu and Uvira.  Yesterday (Tuesday) journalists were allowed across the border at Goma but given restricted access by the rebel ADFL. Some aid agencies are today seeking access to Eastern Zaire and in particular to the huge numbers of refugees who are believed to have gone west of Goma, into the interior (there were about 700,000 around Goma before fighting dispersed them). Efforts will be made to gain access to Mugunga camp, west of Goma town. One aid agency reports that Mugunga has been calm over the last couple of days, that there are still supplies of medicine left at the hospital, local aid workers are trying to distribute existing food supplies, and there is no fuel left for the hospital generator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local aid workers have continued to operate to the best of their ability, and some aid organisations believe that if the ceasefire holds they can make contact with local staff and begin assessment and rudimentary operations in affected areas. Aid workers in Nairobi say they are &quot;unclear&quot; about whether it is possible to successfully negotiate access with permission from Kinshasa - evacuated aid workers are hoping to return to Zaire through Rwanda. Nairobi is being used as a temporary meeting and coordination centre for some humanitarian organisations involved in the crisis, but Rwanda is a key operational base. No food has been delivered for more than a week to eastern Zaire, and existing stocks are believed to have been distributed by local staff - or looted. Agencies believe that although much (if not all) has been looted - like vehicles, radios, generators etc - the equipment is likely to remain in the area because of fuel shortages and rebel restrictions. There have been contradictory reports about the level of discipline among the rebels, and is mostly speculative or incidental because contact has been so limited. Access to Uvira and Bukavu is also limited, and information is mainly emanating from press reports in Goma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN Special Envoy Raymond Chretien has arrived in Nice, France, and plans to meet President Mobutu of Zaire - said to be recuperating from cancer treatment and due to return to Zaire &quot;in the next few days&quot;. UNHCR's Assistant High Commissioner Sergio Vieira de Mello is expected to hold talks in Kinshasa today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Food programme says it is providing food to an emergency shelter in Kigoma, Tanzania, for the 4,600 refugees (mainly Zairean nationals) who have arrived since the weekend - and say thousands more are reportedly on their way. It says it has enough food in northern Tanzania to feed some 20, 000 refugees for one month. WFP say the refugees are arriving in &quot;relatively good condition&quot;. However, Action Contre le Faim (ACF) has reported 14% severe malnutrition among under fives at Gatumba (Burundi).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - Professor Ali Mazrui, the celebrated African author and scholar of humanities, said Tuesday that the time had come for Africa to establish a continental force, along the lines of Kwame Nkrumah's idea of an African High Command.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We (Africans) need institutions for pacifying each other,&quot; he said. &quot;In this direction, I ascribe to Nkrumah's vision for a sort of a pan-African emergency force which can be deployed swiftly to avert the kind of genocide we are helplessly witnessing in Africa today.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the force should be functionally Ppan-African and must be free from the control or manipulation by external or non-African interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mazrui, guest of the Pan-African Writers Association, or PAWA, was delivering in Accra the final part of a two-day lecture on &quot;The African Condition Since Kwame Nkrumah's Fall: 1966-1996&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that unless a more long-term solution was found for Africa's conflicts, countries like Rwanda and Burundi &quot;will, every few years, explode into mutual genocidal behaviour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described as puzzling, the genocidal crisis between the Hutu and Tutsi since they have much more in common than do any other two ethnic groups in relatively more peaceful African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on an African perspective on &quot;The Continent And The World,&quot; Mazrui launched his final presentation with a critical look at some of Nkrumah's ideas and strategies vis-a- vis what he called &quot;Africa's four great cultural denials.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that Nkrumah was wrong when he said &quot;Seek ye first the political kingdom and all other things shall be added unto you&quot; because, Mazrui said, &quot; the cultural kingdom' supersedes the political.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mazrui also said that in spite of Nkrumah's zealous pursuit of African unity, he did not encourage regional groupings because he thought it could make Africans complacent about the need for continental unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Mazrui acknowledged the role which Nkrumah, together with writers of negritude -- Leopold Senghor of Senegal and West Indian Aime Cesaire -- played in rebutting Western claims that the negroid people had no history, no poetry, no philosophy or the capacity for scientific innovation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was through the writings of these black intellectuals, Mazrui said, that such negative stereotypes about Africa were disappearing gradually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So we must be vigilant,&quot; he said. &quot;Let us now strive for the economic kingdom to consolidate the political kingdom. Let us purify the cultural kingdom to the glory and honour of especially one of Africa's greatest ancestors -- Dr Kwame Nkrumah.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambia's Drug Enforcement Commission (DEC) seized drugs worth more than four million U.S. dollars and arrested a total of 1,332 drug traffickers between January and October 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEC spokesman Mukutulu Sinyani told reporters in Lusaka Wednesday the latest culprits included three Tanzanians and a Zambian nabbed last week in the capital with drugs valued at more than 12,000 dollars.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambian suspected drug-trafficker, who was travelling on a Malawian passport, was intercepted at Lusaka international airport as he prepared to fly out to Britain. He was found with 11 hashish cakes wrapped around his torso, legs and thighs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three Tanzanians, who included a woman, were arrested in a Lusaka residential area in possession of six hashish cakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 131 drug traffickers were arrested in October alone and 117 were convicted by the courts for drug-related crimes. They included 126 Zambians, a Briton, Tanzanian, Angolan and South African.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia's anti-drug agents have said that the country was slowly becoming a drugs consumption centre, apart from being a major transit route for drugs to European, American and other overseas markets.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) - Sudan ordered the International Committee of the Red Cross Tuesday to stop all activities in the country, after accusing it of transporting ammunition to rebel controlled areas in southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister of social planning, Mohamed Osman Khalifa, said Tuesday that Khartoum took the decision because the Red Cross' &quot;deviation from the principles of neutrality and the principles guiding humanitarian work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that government had taken the measure only after it had become &quot; clear beyond doubt&quot; that the Red Cross had been involved in transporting ammunition and armed soldiers of the anti-government Southern Peoples' Liberation Army (SPLA) led by John Garang.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As evidence of this complicity, state-run television showed Tuesday a Twin Otter light plane with the Red Cross Logo, in southern Sudan. Beside it were three Red Cross officials, five Sudanese and a number of ammunition boxes taken out of the plane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said that on Friday the plane, carrying the five members of SPLA landed in Gogrial province, Bahr Ghazal State, in southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The pilot was surprised to see that the area was under Kerbino and not Garang and he tried to take off again but was prevented and detained,&quot; the Kerbino group told the Sudan News Agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The area is under the control of Kerbino Kwanyin, leader of the breakaway SPLA/Bahr Ghazal Group which, in April, signed a peace agreement with the Khartoum government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group named the people on the plane as John Early, a Canadian, the pilot; Moshin Raza, a Kenyan co-pilot, and Mary Wulthinton, an Australian nurse. It also gave the names of the five SPLA soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A delegation from the International Red Cross mission in Khartoum and Kenya later visited the scene Nov. 4 and was shown on the national television meeting Kerbino Kwanyin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But neither Khalifa nor Kerbino have spoken about what happened to the planes's passengers and crew or the plane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations is involved in a relief operation, code-named Operation Lifeline Sudan. Helping the world body are a number of humanitarian relief organizations caring for civilians in the war-affected areas in southern Sudan. The International Red Cross is one of the organizations working in this operation. Anti-government forces have been fighting Khartoum in the south since 1983.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI, Kenya (PANA) - A regional summit of African leaders on the crisis in eastern Zaire has called for an immediate cease-fire in the troubled area to enable diplomatic efforts to achieve lasting peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a communique issued Tuesday at the end of a one-day summit in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to territorial integrity of Zaire and called for an end to cross-border incursions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit, chaired by Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi, brought together the Presidents Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, Frederick Chiluba of Zambia, Pasteur Bizimungu of Rwanda, Isaias Afeworki of Eritrea, Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania, Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia and Ferdinand Oyono, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cameroon, representing President Paul Biya, current chairman of the Organisation of Africa Unity (O.A.U.).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also participating in the summit were the O.A.U. secretary-general, Salim Ahmed Salim, and the former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, Facilitator of the peace process. Zaire and Burundi did not take part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting expressed concern at the deteriorating situation in the area and the threat posed to peace and stability in the entire Great Lakes region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It reaffirmed the inalienable rights of all people within the internationally recognised territorial boundaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders also called for more effort in helping Rwandans return home voluntarily. To ensure the success of this effort, the summit called for the implementation of the long standing decision to separate the intimidators and the bonafide refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit called upon the United Nations secretary-general to work closely with his O.A.U. counterpart in the establishment of temporary sanctuaries and safe corridors for victims of the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reaffirming the commitment and readiness of the sub-region to end the conflict, the leaders said that the setting up of safe corridors would make it easier for humanitarian aid to reach the refugees and for their return home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit directed the ministers for foreign affairs of Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia and the representative of O.A.U. Chairman to follow up the decisions of the Summit closely. The foreign ministers were mandated to visit Zaire to convey the decisions of the summit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabweans infected with HIV/AIDS are increasingly turning to traditional healers whose herbs are affordable and some of which have been proved to reverse some of the symptoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Barbara Sibanda, who runs a clinic which combines traditional and conventional medicine, said in an interview there was a noticeable increase in the number of patients who preferred traditional medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early 1996, Gordon Chavunduka, president of the 40,000-strong Zimbabwe National Traditional Healers Association, confirmed the ability of certain herbal medicines to reverse some of the AIDS symptoms.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That confirmation received wide coverage in the local and international media, resulting in increased numbers of HIV-infected people visiting traditional healers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Traditional medicine can alleviate the symptoms of HIV/AIDS. It stops the coughing, diarrhoea and vomiting. When they come here, they also regain their lost weight,&quot; said Sibanda, adding that most of the patients would have been discharged from hospitals to die at home after entering the terminal stages of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from alleviating AIDS symptoms, the clinic also treats asthma, epilepsy, infertility, external cancer and ulcers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prescriptions were affordable because the herbs were readily available in the bush unlike expensive imported modern medicines. Also, unlike modern medicine, traditional herbal use did not result in side effects because it was natural, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also noted that there had been a gradual appreciation of herbal medicine over the past 15 years. Before that, 75 percent of Zimbabweans, like elsewhere in Africa, had drifted away from herbal use due to colonial inspired prejudice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the current trend was that 50 percent of 40 to 50 patients treated at the clinic a day sought both types of treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That trend changed because of government support and recognition of traditional healers. People are now realising that they have to go back to their roots,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sibanda said because of the increase in the number of patients and demand for herbs, the clinic would soon establish a herbal pharmacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health and Child Welfare Minister Timothy Stamps said the pharmacy was a good idea, in line with the trend in the rest of the world where people were turning to herbal treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He encouraged further research on the healing properties of indigenous trees and plants.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The group of 15 developing countries have resolved to resist attempts by rich nations to introduce labour and other social issues under the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and have agreed to work out a common position before the WTO ministerial meeting in Singapore in December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outgoing G-15 chairman and Zimbabwean President, Robert Mugabe, told the closing session of the G-15 summit in Harare that the group also expressed concern at the recent enactment of national legislation and other unilateral measures with extra-territorial effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he did not name any country, it was apparent he was referring to the recent controversial law passed in the United States meant to curtail the activities of companies doing business with Cuba.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mexico, a member of the G-15, expressed concern at the U.S. attitude and called on group member countries to condemn the American action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These measures violate the accepted norms of international law and constitute a serious threat to the sovereignty of nations,&quot; Mugabe said. &quot;The future of the world trading system, the legitimacy of the WTO and the prosperity of both developing and developed countries depend on the respect by all nations for established principles and rules of international jurisprudence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit, which was the sixth since the founding of the group in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in 1989, took a critical view of the current world trading system, considered skewed in favour of the rich. It also focused on ways of ensuring continuity of the group, which in the past has been plagued by poor attendance, as it sought its relevance in a fast-changing world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe said the Uruguay Rounds of trade negotiations which culminated in the formation of the WTO in December 1993 had raised much hope for the poor countries who expected more support from the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The WTO agreements that emerged from the Uruguay Round failed to meet some of these expectations. Nonetheless, we committed ourselves to abide by the rules, meet the challenges and explore the opportunities arising from the birth of world trade organisation,&quot; Mugabe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incoming chairman and Malaysian prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, echoed the group's dissatisfaction with trade arrangements between the rich and poor nations, adding that G-15 members responsible for trade should meet and take a common stand before the WTO meeting in singapore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must close ranks and rededicate ourselves to the cause of the developing countries...The G-15 can be relevant if we want it to be,&quot; Mahathir said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Livingstone - Electricity generation at Victoria Falls power plant in Livingstone has slumped to dangerous levels following a corresponding drop in levels of water on the Zambezi river.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Operations Senior Engineer, Abraham Sashi, said in Livingstone today that the delay in the start of a normal rain season has created grave concerns since the falling water levels might create real problems for the company and consumers in the City of Livingstone and adjoining communities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Sashi noted at normal times the water level on the Zambezi is 1198 cubic metres per second but that this has fallen to 126.68 cubic metres per second.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are generating 44 megawatts of electricity instead of the normal capacity of 108 megawatts due to drastic fall in water flow on the Zasmbezi, '' Mr Sashi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the plant usually exports electricity to Namibia and Botswana and this has not been disturbed by the fall in power generation as Livingstone consumed less megawatts. Livingstone town averages power consumption of only 12 megawatts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Power export to Botswana is two megawatts while Namibia imports three megawatts from Victoria Falls plant. This, Mr Sashi said, was not disturbed as the 44 megawatts being generated covered the figures for local consumption and export. There is no load shedding yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Last year we went low to 37 megawatts in power generation but we fear it might go beyond that in months to come this year. The water situation is not all that healthy. We are likely to fall down further than last year,'' he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Water levels are, however, expected to rise steadily once normal rainfall was recorded in most parts of Zambia including areas from which the river draws much of its volume of water.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Until the government stops dabbling in the treasury bill market, businesses will continue to find it costly to borrow money, warned Zambia Association of Manufacturers (ZAM) chairman, Mark O'Donnell, yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a meeting to discuss Zambia as an emerging market at Lusaka's Hotel Intercontinental yesterday, O'Donnel said the private sector is competing with the government for funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government is winning because it offers more attractive terms through treasury bills,&quot; O'Donnell said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting, focussing on the EU-funded Trade and Enterprise Support Facility (TESF), and attended by a number of business organisations, observed that there was a cash squeeze currently which has disqualified a large number of individuals from participating in loan financing through international agencies such as the International Finance Corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka economist Meebelo Mutukwa agreed that most people were &quot;cash strapped&quot; and that the level of actual investment in Zambia was very low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairman of the Hotels and Catering Association, Gaudenzio Rossi, said financiers demand for security proved to be an impediment in sourcing funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The auctioneers selling property and bailiffs who are grabbing goods daily are an indication of the situation people are in,&quot; Rossi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Zambia Venture Capital Fund general manager, Tladi Ramushu, and another emerging markets specialist on the panel, Bruce Bouchard, said it was necessary that applicants for loans or equity financing contribute something to show their seriousness towards the venture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem with the market in Zambia is that it is still in its infancy and financing is difficult to source,&quot; Bouchard said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Donnell pointed out that most businessmen now preferred to deal in United States dollars to protect themselves against inflation and moreover, could also gain the benefit of real interest rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the European Development Fund will now support small to medium scale enterprises which qualify to benefit from the third phase of the European Community's Structural Adjustment Facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Trade and Enterprise Support Facility (TESF) is part of ECU16.8 million set aside for economic reforms and specifically aimed at assisting the private sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to general manager of the Zambia Venture Capital Fund, Tladi Ramushu, the TESF will not directly provide loan or equity funding to projects but aims at improving access by businessmen to project finance through the traditional lending institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Project proposals from businessmen will be reviewed by selected commercial and merchant banks, the Development Bank of Zambia, and the Zambia Venture Capital Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal will then be submitted to TESF for assistance with funding up to 70 per cent of the pre-investment work required to produce a &quot;bankable&quot; document (project proposal).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some businessmen fear that the TESF funds will continue to cater for the same categories who have received help before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are a number of businessmen with brilliant projects who just do not have the means to raise even a quarter of the 30 per cent base capital required. What Zambians now need is a facility that will be able to widen the industrial base, otherwise they will continue to fund the same people who have received aid year after year,&quot; said Ben Bwalya of Siana Enterprises.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Former Konkola Blades striker, Dennis Lota, finally leaves for Leicester after next Sunday's World Cup encounter against Congo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dimunitive striker disclosed in an interview yesterday that all the hurdles that had precluded his much-publicised move to the English premier division side have since been overcome.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am leaving after next Sunday's game,&quot; Lota, whose transfer has not been without controversy, enthused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He, however, said that he has yet to sign the contract forms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will sign them when I get there (Leicester),&quot; the free scoring player claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what has come to be known as the &quot;Lota Saga&quot;, Konkola sold the player to South Africa's premier division side, Witbank Aces, for a paltry R40,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before even kicking a ball, Witbank decided to sell the player, first to some Swiss side and laterLeicester United.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this somewhat stirred a hornets nest and the unfolding saga claimed a few scalps at Konkola Blades and Anchor House.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Over one billion kwacha intended for the purchasing of maize by the Food Reserve Agency (FRA) has been diverted, on the instructions of the government, to the bailing out of the Southern Province Marketing and Cooperative Union(SPMCU).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Zambia National Farmers Union (ZNFU) has questioned the government's directing of the autonomous FRA to buy SPMCU's storage sheds at a cost of K1.1 billion in a bid to enable the limping organisation to clear its debts with Finance Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is hard to understand how FRA should be directed to make this purchase at a time when considerable stocks of maize still remain unpurchased in villages and risk being damaged by the rains, particularly since the FRA already has enough storage capacity and is in fact renting out storage sheds to other agents,&quot; complained ZNFU president Ajaye Vashee in a press statement released in Lusaka yesterday. &quot;Does the government think that extra storage is more important than buying maize?&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vashee also accused the government for compromising the autonomy of the FRA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the third time, since its inception, the autonomy of the Food Reserve Agency has been compromised by government, in this last case in a manner which has blatant political implications,&quot; Vashee carped. &quot;If the FRA is to develop any credibility it must be seen to be acting in an autonomous and non- partisan manner. The potential involvement of FRA with SPCMU at the direction of the minister does nothing to enhance standings of any parties involved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday agriculture minister Suresh Desai appointed a new board at SPCMU comprising businessmen, cooperators and farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the new appointees on the ten member board are Michael Beckett a Choma Farmer, Bates Namuyamba a former Member of Parliament and Naik Nalendra managing director of Standard Sales Limited of Choma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But ZNFU is wondering why SPMCU has been singled out &quot;for this special treatment&quot; and which of the other struggling co-operative unions FRA will be called on next to assist.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - It is very difficult to advance an argument of electoral fraud ahead of actual voting. There is a danger that such an argument will always be dismissed as speculation, malice, lies or sheer fear of the unknown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until people have actually voted and glaring irregularities experienced rather than talked about, people will tend to be sceptical about these exposures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is principally this position which makes the UNIP boycott of elections a subject of heavy attack by those opposed to their view.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I suppose for instance, that those opposing the UNIP stand would rather wait for November 18 and 19 to witness a mass uprising from defrauded would be voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wait for those who would have failed to vote because their names are omitted, misspelt or displaced to another constituency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The argument of a credible electoral process however transcends partisan parameters. Public confidence in an electoral system begins with a clear and acceptable electoral process. Putting together the issues raised about our electoral process, there is a case which needs the attention of the Electoral Commission, political parties and the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are over 20, 0000 voters on the Nikuv register who potentially can vote twice or on whose names a second person can easily vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are people entered in the registers more than once.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Central province alone has more than 7, 000 and the Copperbelt has over 16, 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case may be the same or worse elsewhere. Then there are several genuinely registered voters who will not find their names on the registers at polling stations because they have been displaced to alien polling stations which they may not know about until after November 18. Mwembezhi and Nangoma constituencies in Mumbwa and Kapiri Mposhi are such areas. To this add the confusion of dead registered voters and those who have willingly surrendered their voters cards or been coerced into so doing by political parties. All this within a register of a meagre 2.3 voters and out of whom only 1.3 have voters cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the scenario which must produce a legitimate government come November 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was amazed that Voters cards are indeed rubbing off so easily. I have seen several! Agenda for Zambia president Akashambatwa Mbikusita-Lewanika never lied after all when he first made this revelation some time ago. Now Nikuv which has made us believe these cards cannot be forged and are being printed in America is easily recollecting any faded cards and within the precincts of Mulungushi Hall can reprint your details on them or even change the details in under five minutes! I am aware of over 40, 000 blank voters cards still with elections office and Nikuv - but for what use and by whom?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And to add to the confusion government must announce that it will issue voters certificates to anyone claiming to have surrendered their cards to UNIP or other such conmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I suppose that most, if not all, say 500,000 voters who have surrendered their cards did so voluntarily. Who then will answer the government call to go and line up for voter certificates? I cannot imagine that all these people surrendering cards are as dull as we want to project them- people who did not know what they were doing when they let go their cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If government however, managed to replace all of these voters it could only mean that indeed, all these people were coerced in one way or other to give up their cards or that government is taking its chance and these can not be the real voters!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All these issues about the register definitely can not just be UNIP and ZDC or Lima Party propaganda. It is never too late to correct a wrong like this but it can be too late to quell the fire once it starts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of all this, the most insulting thing to the people of Zambia is to be told through Bobby Bwalya who in any case wants to be irritatingly atangonising, that their 'independent electoral commission' has no independent power to review these complaints and investigate them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bwalya has also the cheek to say he cannot see ghost voters or double entries in his own register. But that is precisely the problem. The electoral commission has been too lazy to have the sacrifice and patience of one Masautso Phiri to read the register name by name, NRC by NRC and Voters card number by voters card number. That is why its Chairman Bwalya is still blind to the glaring blunders of his register.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If his commission has no power prior to elections to resolve these issues and restore some confidence in the electorate who has? Zambians know that it is even worse to hope to redress this situation after elections. Elections must not be held for their own sake. It is the process which is even much more important than polling day.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Chiefs have joined UNIP's boycott of the November 18 presidential and parliamentary elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Royal Foundation of Zambia (RFZ), grouping most of Zambia's traditional rulers, in a petition after meetings of the organisation in three towns decided not to take part in the elections unless amendments they have suggested are made to the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have also demanded that a constitutional meeting takes place in Kabwe on November 12 and that the election date be postponed to December 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RFZ chairman, chief Chamuka, who released the petition dated November 1 to President Frederick Chiluba , said the foundation's meetings in Kasama, Monze and Kabwe had resolved to boycott this year's elections because of the constitution which discriminates against them. The petition is also signed by his secretary chief Malembeka of Ndola rural.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Royal Foundation of Zambia reject the MMD imposed 1996 Constitution entrenched in the hybrid presidential centralist state system of government as total tyranny over the traditional tribal kingdoms,&quot; the petition reads in part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The release of the petition follows a call by Mpezeni, the paramount of the Ngoni people of Eastern Province, for chiefs in other parts of the country to champion their people's demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are chiefs because of the people. We cannot do what people do not want.  Power is the people and what people don't want chiefs too don't want,&quot; Mpezeni said in an interview in Lusaka on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT) president Alfred Zulu, said this development means that a wider segment of society is now boycotting the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This means the elections will just come to an end and if they are boycotting, it will be a serious predicament. This sends the last nail in the coffin. The chiefs are a very important institution and if they boycott because they don't move long, they will move a large ethnic grouping with them,&quot; Zulu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He advised the MMD government to stop the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Inter-party Alliance chairman, Roger Chongwe, has supported the demands by the chiefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chiefs have a right to participate fully in the affairs of the country.  The 1991 Constitution has a provision for the creation of of a Chamber of Representatives,&quot; Chongwe said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Royal Foundation is demanding that the elections be postponed to December 18 to allow for all parties to participate and the establishment of a federal system to embrace all the citizens as opposed to what they claim is the unicameral hybrid presidential system of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Royal Foundation demands extension of the election date to December 18, 1996 to allow all political parties who did not lodge Nomination papers to take part,&quot; chief Chamuka demanded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chiefs are also demanding a bicameral legislature comprising the National Assembly and that the House of Chiefs be transformed into a chamber of representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are also asking government to convene a consultative constitutional dialogue to which representatives of the governments of United States, Germany and Britain are invited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while President Chiluba will lead the government and MMD delegation, 27 chiefs, who are members of the foundation , will represent the country's 279 traditional chiefs. The Royal Foundation also suggested that Churches, the Law Association of Zambia and other civic institutions be invited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say this meeting be chaired by the Zambia Independent Monitoring Team(ZIMT) and should be held in Kabwe on November 12, 1996 to address the question: &quot;Does the 1996 Constitution stand the test of time?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And ZIMT have welcomed the foundation's proposal saying they have always been willing to sponsor any meeting meant to resolve the outstanding constitutional and electoral issues.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Bill Clinton's re-election as United States President for another four year term, beating Republican rival Bob Dole and Ross Perot, has cheered Zambians and Zimbabweans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The results announced yesterday have cheered politicians in Zambia and the Southern African region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his re-election speech Clinton applauded Dole and Perot's campaign and pledged to work with them. He added that there was no longer time to talk but to act towards the development of the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinton scooped the majority vote recording 51 per cent followed by Dole's 41 per cent and Perrot's nine per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Clinton's arch rival, Dole, yesterday conceded defeat but also pledged to continue serving the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I going to sit back for a few days but I am going to stand up and do what is best for America,&quot; Dole said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Lusaka, Clinton's re-election has been hailed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bill Clinton's party, the Democrats, have values and ideals that are close to UNIP's. It respects minorities, the underprivileged and so this victory should cheer UNIP,&quot; said UNIP president Kenneth Kaunda's press aide Muhabi Lungu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka Central Independent parliamentary candidate and former commerce minister Dipak Patel said Clinton's re-election would favour Africa more than that of a Republican candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is good for Africa. He has a positive attitude for this continent and I hope he also remembers that Africa is not just South Africa. We welcome his victory,&quot; Patel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwean High Commissioner to Zambia, Tirivafi Kangai, giving his personal view of Clinton's victory also praised the Democrats' consistent position towards Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We (Zimbabwe) have had a very good relationship with the US. We've had very good rapport, especially with the democrats. I for one worked closely with Andrew Young at one time, we got good support from the Jimmy Carter administration. Though out our struggle the democrats were very supportive so the victory is good for us,&quot; Kangai said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was difficult to get a comment from the Zambian government as the chief government spokesman, information minister Amusaa Mwanamwambwa, and President Frederick Chiluba's press aide were said to be out of town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republicans have generally taken a hard line on supportive effort to the rest of the world especially third world countries and have been pushing the democrats to cut further all USA aid to these countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants discussed the strategic importance of the Mediterranean region and the necessity to implement various measures to consolidate cooperation and partnership between countries on both flanks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Symposium participants called for a number of initiatives, which included the creation of a Mediterranean security and cooperation organization, a fund to assist large and medium size projects, and a bank for development and investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants also proposed the adoption by Mediterranean countries of a charter for the protection of immigrants between countries north and south of the Mediterranean, the promotion of channels of cooperation between the political parties of the region, and the creation of a permanent structure to promote dialogue and partnership between Mediterranean countries to be headquartered in Tunis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organized by the Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD) to commemorate the ninth anniversary of the November 7 1987 change in Tunisia, the symposium was opened November 4 with a speech by president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and delivered by Prime Minister Hamed Karoui.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his speech, president Ben Ali said that an open, safe, and developed Euro-Mediterranean region is &quot;dependent upon the development of our countries, their internal stability, and the relationships of cooperation and complementarity they establish between each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The active integration to globalization means order at home,&quot; he said, stressing the need &quot;to coordinate the national economic policies to sustain co-development, to educate and sensitize young generations about their Mediterranneaness&quot; through education and culture and &quot;respect for each other's national cultural specificities.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRIPOLI, Libya (PANA) - King Hassan of Morocco confirmed the existence of &quot; direct contacts&quot; between his country and the Polisario Front in an address broadcast on radio and television on the 21st anniversary of the Green March which led to Morocco's annexation of Western Sahara in 1975.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Morocco and the Polisario Front claim the former Spanish territory.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Moroccan leader revealed Wednesday evening that the talks lasted two days and were led by Crown Prince Sidi Mohamed, assisted by Interior Minister Driss Basri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that he was ready to personally meet the Polisario delegation. But &quot;only when preliminary contacts have borne fruit&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At any rate, the palace gates remain open&quot;, the king said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his ten-minute speech broadcast by Moroccan satellite television monitored in Tripoli, King Hassan said the first contacts took place at the request of Polisario.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next talks will be part of the UN plan to solve the issue of Western Sahara, which Morocco describes as the &quot;only guarantee for the future of peace in the region&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1975, Morocco and Mauritania shared the former Spanish colony of Rio De Oro and Saguia El-Hamra, following an agreement signed in Madrid with Spain.  The war which was immediately started by the Polisario Front forced Nouakchott to renounce it claims and leave the whole territory to Morocco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1984, the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic (RASD), proclaimed in 1976, was formally authorized to sit at the OAU, which admitted it as a member in 1982. Morocco immediately left the continental organization of which it was a founding member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">King Hassan mentioned in his speech current reforms in his country, stressing that regionalization offers an ideal framework for the expression of the specific aspirations of all families in the kingdom.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - The South African government has suspended all arms sales to Rwanda until peace and stability have returned to the Great Lakes states of Central Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the announcement at a media conference in Pretoria Wednesday, South African Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad said the decision had been taken after high level consultations with the leaders of the Great Lakes region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time there have been reports of cross-border raids into Zaire by Rwandan armed forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pahad confirmed that the decision to suspend the arms sales to Rwanda had already been conveyed to Kigali, but there had been no response to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the National Conventional Arms Control Committee would review the entire situation once stability had been re-established and things were back to normal in Central Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He denied that South African arms had fuelled the fighting between Tutsi rebels and the Zairean army in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that only a few armored cars had been sent to Rwanda in terms of the 18.5-million-U.S.-dollar September arms deal between the two countries, and there were no indications that these vehicles had been used in the current conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said that at this stage, the South African armed forces were not in a position to play a role in an African peacekeeping force. In any event, the United Nations Security Council still had to decide at its meeting later this week on whether or not a peacekeeping force should be sent to the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should the Security Council decide on such action, Pahad said, South Africa could consider sending troops, but only if approved by the Organization of African Unity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - The Royal Foundation of Zambia, an umbrella organization for most Zambian traditional chiefs, has petitioned President Frederick Chiluba to postpone the Nov. 18 general elections until objections over constitutional amendments barring them from active politics are resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chiefs have threatened to boycott the elections if Chiluba's government failed to meet their demand.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest constitutional amendments bars chiefs from active participation in politics unless they relinquish their traditional posts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Royal Foundation of Zambia reject the MMD imposed 1996 constitution entrenched in the hybrid presidential centralist system of government as total tyranny over the traditional tribal kingdoms,&quot; said the chiefs' in the petition to Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MMD is the Movement for Multiparty Democracy headed by Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the petition, printed Thursday by the Post, a privately owned daily newspaper, the chiefs said that the appeal to Chiluba was agreed at three recent meetings in Kasama, northern Zambia; Monze, southern Zambia and Kabwe in the Midlands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chiefs have suggested a postponement of the elections to Dec. 18. They have proposed a constitutional meeting for Nov. 12, involving all political stakeholders, other interested parties and observers, to resolve the impasse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have also recommended that such a meeting be attended by representatives of the governments of the United States, Germany and Britain.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Another summit of the Group of 15 developing countries (G-15), has come and gone with calls for intensified South-South co- operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call, made at the end of the sixth summit in Harare on Tuesday, has become a regular feature of the groups's annual meetings, with no tangible evidence that trade has actually gone up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Latest statistics show that trade and investment co-operation within the grouping remains low with intra-G-15 trade amounting to only 5.5 billion U.S.  dollars in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The G-15 countries, up to the end of the sixth summit, were Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Senegal, Peru, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, and Yugoslavia, which is under United Nations suspension. Kenya was accepted as the 17th member at the Harare summit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The need for more business interaction among member states was more than emphasized at the Harare meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was noted that the success of the G-15, formed in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in 1989, hinged on increased networking and direct contacts between member states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incoming chairman and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and outgoing chairman President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe said at the summit there was need to convert words into action and look to each other for trade and investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe cited his country's controversial deal with YTL of Malaysia to buy 51 percent shares of the Hwange thermal power station as an example of South- South co-operation that should be encouraged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahathir said developing countries should not continue to allow Western states to make money from their resources and services, but should promote trade among themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jamaican Prime Minister Percival Patterson said: &quot;As a group we should serve as a beacon and guide to other developing countries and we can only do that by promoting co-operation among ourselves through South-South co- operation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with all this commitment among the leaders of the group, why then is trade so low?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the G-15 was formed, it was to be the think-tank of the developing world and co-ordinate policy from which development would take place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially, members were chosen from Non-Aligned Movement countries which were influential and whose economies showed potential. But lack of interest by some member countries in the group is apparently shown in the default in payment of membership subscriptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group has since its first summit in 1990 failed to attract a 100- percent attendance of heads of state and government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1993, its summit, which was scheduled for India, was postponed as there was no quorum of five heads of state and government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is worrying to note that the attendance is concentrated around a few countries,&quot; said Tichaona Jokonya, chairman of the personal representatives' meeting and Zimbabwean ambassador to Geneva,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only heads of state from Zimbabwe, Malaysia, Senegal and India have attended all the five previous summits while Argentina and Indonesia have attended four, Venezuela three and the rest between one and two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven heads of state and government attended the Harare summit and these were President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, Mahathir, Patterson, Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, Senegalese Prime Minister Habib Thiam, Algerian Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia and Mugabe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was suggested at the summit that may be if future discussions centered on macro-economics and politics directly affecting member countries, attendance could improve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mexico suggested that the summit be held biennially to give time to member countries to implement projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahathir urged leaders to show their commitment and attend the next summit in Kuala Lumpur in 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another reason for low trade among the G-15 states is that most of the countries are poor and lack resources and know-how.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, of the 21 projects approved by the group, four had either not started or were at low level, nine were at implementing stage, four were nearing completion and four had not been concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conflicts in some African countries are also a threat to stability and development to the continent. Other problems haunting member states include hunger, environmental degradation and drug trafficking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Zimbabwe's foreign minister, Stan Mudenge, says the G-15 is still a baby and that given a chance, it will be a force to reckon with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egypt's President Mubarak summed it all when he said: &quot;The responsibility for development and integration in the new global economy is ours alone. No one shall come to our aid unless we take the initiative by utilizing the opportunities available in order to promote co-operation within the family of Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A major topic that emerged at the summit was the need to resist World Trade Organization (WTO) rules bent on discriminating against developing nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The G-15 members are particularly unhappy with the inclusion of labor and social issues in the WTO rules and regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it will be interesting to see how much muscle they have to resist WTO changes to be discussed at a crucial ministerial conference in Singapore in December.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Over 700 striking nurses at Zimbabwe's major referral hospitals, Parirenyatwa and Harare Central have received letters of dismissal from the Public Service Commission, after defying a government order to return to work by Oct. 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some nurses, who said they had returned to work by the deadline, also received the dismissal letters on Wednesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government announced last week that it had fired nurses, believed to be about 2,000, who had refused to heed an ultimatum to return to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strike by the health sector entered its 18th day on Thursday, with nurses and doctors vowing to continue until their grievances are addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The juniors, who had returned to work by Wednesday last week, resumed their strike on Tuesday when two doctors were arrested on allegations of instigating their colleagues to take industrial action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are pressing for the unconditional reinstatement of the dismissed nurses and better working conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the second time in two months that strike by nurses and doctors has paralysed the health sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace in Zimbabwe (CCJP) has urged all the striking professionals to return to work and save lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The commission acknowledges the validity of the cause of the health workers and supports them in their efforts to have their situation corrected or at least improved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, their point has been clearly made and the increased suffering of thousands of patients can no longer be justified,&quot; said CCJP in a statement on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission implored government to treat the matter as a national emergency and take immediate steps to correct &quot;the gross inadequacies&quot; in the health workers conditions of service.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - The current Central African crisis -- revolving around Zaire, Rwanda and Burundi -- will feature strongly in the international spotlight in the next few days, as international and regional organizations meet to decide on future action to alleviate the steadily deteriorating situation in the Great Lakes region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As emphasized by South African Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad, the situation is of great and wide concern because -- should it explode -- it could affect the entire African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pahad said that South Africa welcomed the outcome of this week's Regional Summit in Nairobi, where there was unanimous recognition of the need for urgent international action to address the plight of refugees in strife-torn eastern Zaire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South Africa shares this concern,&quot; he said, &quot;and will lend its support to deliberations by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity to find practical actions that could be taken in this regard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nairobi Summit -- attended by the leaders of Kenya, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia -- called for the immediate setting up of safe corridors and sanctuaries inside Zaire to facilitate humanitarian assistance and repatriation of refugees. It said the United Nations Security Council should deploy what it called a neutral force for this purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saying that this appeal would be widely discussed by the parties involved in the next few days, Pahad revealed that former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere -- mediator in the Burundi peace process -- would visit South Africa on Saturday for discussions on the situation in Zaire, and the possible future role of the international community and South Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It might have been a stupid tour to lay on after the busiest season ever, but at least it has started in the right place. Isolated pockets of Argentina are aware that the world champions are in their backyard, but while a few players are carrying muscle injuries, there are not many Springboks who will be flying to France with wrist injuries, the result of over zealous autograph signing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the laager mentality of more than one post-isolation tour, it is refreshing to see how relaxed many members of this squad are. Relaxed enough to wander around the bustling streets of Rosario last Monday in ones and twos, rather than the rolling mauls, safety in numbers, of yore. James Small, for one, is delighted to be able to pass unrecognised in the throng.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The management made an important move early in the tour as well, announcing the team to play Rosario early enough to let all the players know where they stand. There was thus no pussy-footing around the issue of who would make the Test team and, thank heaven, no provincial nonsense from speculating journalists. They were able to watch the Test team practise days before it was officially announced, so no pathetic one-upmanship over who has the coach's ear has been indulged in either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The manager, too, has benefitted from the breath of fresh air provided by Argentina. On Tuesday while Gary Teichmann led the Test team through a game of touch rugby at Rosario's Jockey Club, Andre Markgraaff ran around on an adjoining field with the rest of his management team, trying in vain to lay a hand on Carel du Plessis, and to develop a sidestep that also eluded him as a player, laughing all the while.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A certain humility pervades the camp at the moment and one wonders what previous Springbok coaches would have made of Markgraaff's decision to practise defensive patterns on turnover ball. The drill saw Kobus Wiese knock over a tackle bag, but lose the ball forward, whence the follow-up forwards were coached where to slot in, how to avoid being caught offside and how to make sure that the first subsequent tackle is made well behind the opposition advantage line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A simple enough exercise, but one can imagine a few of those previous coaches holding their heads in shame that the current incumbent could think so negatively as to expect a Springbok to lose the ball going forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday's first Test will tell us a little about how far this team has come since the All Black humiliation, and how far it can go before new faces are required. The best aspect of it is the back line where every position looks a cut above the Pumas. Re-uniting the back three of Andre Joubert, James Small and Jacques Olivier immediately gives the team balance and one is left wondering all over again how such minor talents as Justin Swart and Pieter Hendriks were allowed to play every Test they were available for this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olivier for one will look upon Saturday's game as a chance to re-invent his career. Three years ago in Buenos Aires he went down with flu on the eve of the first Test. A young man who was thought a political choice, not worth his place in the squad, took his chance and stepped into legend. That man was Chester Williams and while the Paarl pearl's star waxed, Olivier's waned, with injuries adding their insults to his illness. He may never get back the spring in his step taken by successive knee injuries, but he is a cerebral player par excellence and just to see him thinking on the ball is worth a lifetime of watching a lesser player sprint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olivier confirmed the mood in the camp while watching the dirt trackers beat Rosario 45-36 on Tuesday night. He said, &quot;This is the most relaxed tour we've ever been on. We're playing plenty of golf and trying not to take our rugby too seriously. Mind you, things might change if we lose a couple of games.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is the nub of the matter. It's easy to smile when you're winning, and even when Tuesday's game was almost turned on its head by Rosario's amateurs, Markgraaff had the grace and patience to deal with an interminable bilingual press conference afterwards. If the Test side should slip up against the Pumas we might see a less sanguine performance from the manager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In truth though, it is difficult to see a banana skin lying in wait on this section of the tour. The only real weakness for the Springboks is in the front row where Dawie Theron may struggle as badly against Roberto Grau as he did earlier in the year against Olo Brown. But Theron's performance may be irrelevent if Natal's Adrian Garvey confirms the rich promise that he has shown in the last two seasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garvey is not as big as some tightheads, but he has a habit of finishing a game stronger than even the most illustrious of opponents. He is also a wonderful ball handler with a sound temperament and, if Markgraaff was culpable for not picking Garvey in his original squad, he will be forgiven for getting it right in the end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Garvey makes the step up well on this tour, the prospect of seeing him and Os du Randt in the same side next year is mouth-watering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Players such as Garvey and Du Randt are crucial to the kind of game that Markgraaff and his assistants are trying to build. Basically it involves bringing the tight five to a level of fitness and vision that allows them to arrive first at the breakdown created by the loose forwards, thus creating quick second and third phase ball for the backs to run onto. If the theories work in practice we could be in for a thrilling few years of Springbok rugby.  It is such a refreshing thought that it is to be hoped the drawing-board will be allowed to gather dust for as long as possible.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - On Tuesday Wilf Paish - the highly respected British athletics coach who was brought to South Africa to prepare South Africa's athletes for the Olympic Games in Atlanta - returned home two months before his contract was due to expire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paish had tendered his resignation just days before the Olympic team departed for Atlanta in protest at the way the sport's governing body Athletics South Africa (ASA) reneged on agreements relating to the selection of the Olympic team and the general way in which the sport is administered with no regard for the athletes that ASA is supposed to serve</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before his departure Paish gave his view of the way athletics is administered in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AS far as sport is concerned, South Africa is a very proud nation. Its expectation levels are very high, and in sports such as cricket and rugby their achievement levels match their aspirations. Hence, it is extremely sad for me to recognise that track and field athletics, which is the &quot;centrepiece&quot; of any Olympic Games and Commonwealth Games, appears to be in such disarray.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hardly a week passes when we do not read in the press or hear over the radio of more administrative bungling within the sport. Natal is attempting a breakaway, Boland had to take Athletics South Africa to court, there are several pending court cases, and rumours of others - all involving the administrators of the association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In my discussions with many of the athletes, coaches and officials, from all &quot;avenues&quot; within the sport, I have only heard one woman say any kind things about the administration. In the light of all of this one must believe that there is probably something wrong within the sport. No matter what nation, which sport, a situation such as one must believe to exist, cannot be allowed to prevail for any length of time, since it is certain to encourage anarchy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the Olympic team coach I have been deeply involved in all aspects of track and field athletics. I have tried to convince myself, mainly for the well-being of the sport I love, that it is all part of a changing nation with diverse cultural differences, which time alone will correct. However, I am certain that the possibility of a change taking place is remote since the basic philosophy of the sport is wrong. Like all other sports, athletics has only one commodity: athletes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the sport is not &quot;athlete-centred&quot; then the sport is destined to fail.  I know that administrators have to seek a fine balance between the needs of the elite athletes and the need to organise a sport for the masses. It is a balance which all other elite sporting nations in the world have achieved by making the correct compromises, and one which other major sports within South Africa have also done so successfully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an informed outsider, I am convinced that there is no long-term strategy for the sport. It appears to lack an informed &quot;helmsman&quot; who could at least steer a central course. I have not met anyone within the structure of the sport with whom I would be happy to know that the sport has an informed diplomat/ambassador; a person who can discuss the sport in terms of anything other than political motives; one who could be placed on any platform in the world and confront an informed audience and emerge with honour and dignity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a person who has spent a lifetime at the sharp edge of his sport, I am sad to reflect that the sport lacks integrity, supported by a code of professional ethics; something that can only come through professional expertise, experience and qualifications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sport must realise that few, if any, athletes are &quot;politicians&quot;. They are mainly very young people, with high aspiration levels, who recognise that they only have a very limited time in which to demonstrate their skills. The lifespan of any sportsman, certainly at the elite level, is measurable in years rather than decades. Hence, to have vital years lost through administrative errors, as is the case of Phillip Spies, the nation's best javelin thrower, is little short of a disaster. They represent years that can never be recaptured. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. South Africa could almost certainly achieve a clean sweep of the medals for the throwing events at the next Commonwealth Games, yet I sense few if any of these athletes will be selected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There must be a radical change in both the philosophy of the sport and its &quot; politics&quot;. The sport must become &quot;athlete-centred&quot;. The athletes must be provided with the kind of support which the Operation Excellence wing of the National Olympic Committee of South Africa offered. They must be provided with coaches who are well-informed and well - trained. Such people exist here, but are not used. Likewise, they must have the support of all of the sport's science and medical fraternity. Again there is an abundance of such people here in South Africa waiting to be used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Selection for any team must only be based on merit. I am afraid athletes do not understand &quot;affirmative action&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True &quot;development&quot; must be the responsibility of the Department of Education. It must be in tandem with the training of motivated teachers.Of course this can be done in liaison with ASA which should make an input into the initial training of teachers and for their in- service training. However, any such partnership must be just that and not a dictatorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All that I can say as a final conclusion is that if this situation arose in the United Kingdom then the Sports Council - the government organisation responsible for sport - would have been forced into carrying out an independent inquiry. South Africa has some of the finest young athletes in the world. They have invested their future in ASA. They deserve the best possible support which their nation can provide.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - As magnificent as South Africa's form was in the Titan Cup, although they fell at the final hurdle, their success will linger only as long in the minds as a good dream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gary Kirsten said before the final that the team had created something that would be long-standing in the record books, something that they could always be proud of. The point is, as he readily admitted a moment later, books cannot be affected by form and fickle nature; memories can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Test cricket is what people remember ... we've played 29 one-day internationals since our last Test match and I'm not even sure that I can remember what happened in several of them.&quot; And here's a man who has scored six hundreds in the year!</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In three random test questions fired at four South African players, they were asked to recall their individual performances in certain &quot;selected&quot; one- day internationals over the last 36 months. The accuracy percentage of their responses levelled at around 70%, but some classic answers were: &quot;Was that the game where I made 80? ... no, it was just 30 ... no, did I make 50? In fact, did I play in that game?&quot; The best answer from the two bowlers was: &quot; The only good games are the ones where you don't get slogged. If I went for less than 40 then it was a good game ... how many did I go for, incidentally?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The players ought to remember, at least better than the fans. Although the unfortunate four South Africans in question were queried on several obscurities! But test yourself on these. How many one-dayers did South Africa play against India in 1993? What was the score in the series? Who made 100s?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And tougher still, what can you remember about the Hero Cup? How many teams competed? To whom did South Africa lose in the semi- finals? By how many runs? (It was very close, and a very good game!)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details of individual and team performances are likely to become even more quickly blurred after the Titan Cup for two reasons:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l The team has become the victim of its own success. There were only two (&quot; good&quot;) one- day matches during the preliminary stages, both involving India and Australia. The Hansie Cronje-Bob Woolmer combination meant the South African team were simply too good to be exciting - the very essence of why limited overs cricket is so limited. The first requirement for &quot;success&quot; is two teams equally matched ... or at least performing equally on the day. How can a game be killed as a spectacle because one team performs brilliantly?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How many times will cricket fans say &quot;What a terrible Test match ... it was so one- sided.&quot; The immediate reaction is to appreciate the brilliance of a majestic fast bowler, a dextrous spinner, a stubborn batsman. But nothing is as dull as a one- sided one-dayer ... and South Africa have become a very dull one-day team!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l A Test series follows immediately after the Titan Cup, and whatever may happen therein will be remembered far more clearly than the three-nation coloured clothing get- together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, the Test matches are where the glory and long-lasting memories lie. The current South African squad will never be remembered as the team that lost the Titan Cup: they will be remembered as the team that won a series in India, should they achieve the second- rarest feat in Test cricket. Only the West Indies yields less to visitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every South African player, and every Indian Test contender, is adamant that the Test series is all that really matters, so there is little point in repeating their assertions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The team that adjusts best will almost certainly come out on top,&quot; asserts Pat Symcox. &quot;Both teams have played so much one- day cricket recently that it's going to be very difficult to get the mind right. The idea of bowling two balls the same sounds ridiculous to me at the moment, let alone two overs! But I know that everything will have to change, I'll have to maintain pretty much the same pace, be patient, attack at the right time, defend at the right time, not be too upset when runs are scored!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's going to be a real test of character for this team, to see just how good we really are, how versatile we can be. There's no doubt in my mind that the first Test will set the tone for the series, actually the first morning.  Whoever wins the toss and bats first will have to do it very well because, as everyone knows, if you don't post a big total here in India then you're inevitably on the back foot for the rest of the match,&quot; says Symcox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And if you have to bowl first you have to keep it tight all the time. A loose hour, or an untidy session can see the other team escape to a big total.  We're up to the task, but it's going to take every bit of our skill and experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task of adaptation is as difficult for the batsmen. Says Kirsten: &quot;The idea of leaving balls alone outside off-stump is completely alien to me, weird. But like Pat, we are all going to have to adjust quickly. Leaving deliveries alone, building an innings, playing risk-free, chanceless cricket and making the bowler earn your wicket. All these things must return quickly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kirsten does not admit to harbouring personal desires or targets for the three- Test series, but clearly something is on his mind when he says: &quot;I wonder whether we will see the first double-century from a South African since we returned to international cricket ...?&quot; Kirsten is first in the queue, perhaps, having notched an unbeaten 200 against Durham on the national team's tour of England two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But physical and practical adaptations are just h</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lf the battle. Mental preparation, once again, falls under the finely tuned guidance of the coach Bob Woolmer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'I know he's got a few little surprises for us,&quot; says Allan Donald, a close friend as well as a &quot;student&quot;. Woolmer brought over 100 video casettes with him to India, some of which are rather poorly reproduced feature films to keep the team amused</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But many more contain hours and hours of Test match footage, filmed over the last 10 years. Every Indian dismissal from their recent series against England has been analysed by the coach and will be played many times to the squad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, with the help of two three-day first class games before the first Test, the squad will feel as though they have been playing Test cricket all year by the time they take to the field in Ahmedabad. Every evening the team, having exhausted their supply of American action movies, will watch Test cricket. They will see themselves leaving balls alone outside off-stump, they will see themselves taking wickets, bowling patiently, concentrating ...  everything that constitutes Test cricket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Indian team, of course, will attempt to do all the same things. But unless they have secretly updated their preparation techniques, they will find that, as in every other aspect of the game (one-day and five- day) they will take to the field with a significant disadvantage already in place.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - There is, so the talk goes, a job in professional golf that no one wants right now. It is the hole left by the departure of Brent Chalmers as the South African PGA tour commissioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public announcement of Chalmers's departure came at the annual general meeting of the PGA this week, and Chalmers insists that &quot;there is nothing sinister&quot; in the move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many ways, golf will be different without the brash Chalmers at the forefront. He has done much for the professional game in this country, taking a tour that was staggering towards extinction and getting First National Bank and the corporates to revive their interest.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has fought the twin spectres of declining gates and abridged TV coverage and managed to bring the tour through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The TV question remains a moot point. One side contends that Chalmers was far too demanding in what he wanted. The PGA's position was that coverage had been downgraded and that the game deserved better treatment. It is one of those Catch 22 arguments where the only real losers are the viewing public.  It is an issue which will have to be sorted out for the future, long- term good of the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest point at issue has been the wall-to-wall coverage accorded the European Tour-aligned tournaments as counterpoint to the normal FNB tour events, both those on the main tour and on the winter leg designed for the stay-at-home pros.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chalmers was the driving force behind South Africa getting a look-in on the European Tour - a move not roundly applauded by all - and bringing the vistas of courses like Houghton into the consciousness of the rest of the golfing world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For this he must be applauded and he will continue in a marketing capacity for the PGA he has helped take out of the red. In doing so though, Chalmers has not made a host of friends and, while this does not necessarily mean he has made enemies at every turn, his abrasive approach has been both his greatest strength and his signal weakness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chalmers admits to being a maverick, a loner who makes his own decisions without the hindrance of consultation with those around him. A former high- ranking officer in the citizen force, Chalmers has always been a gung-ho type of person, a full steam ahead and damn the torpedoes approach typifying his actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an organisation which depends on the OK of every professional player in the country, it has always had the look of a marriage of convenience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chalmers has trod his own path, bringing in the sponsorships and ensuring that the tour got off its knees and stood proud again. In doing so though, he has forced a path against some fairly hairy thickets of resentment and opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is more a general observation than a criticism of Chalmers. His record speaks for itself. But human nature being what it is, people do not like to be dictated to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is, admit sources close to the inner circle at the PGA, an attitude that has done much for the game in making the tour a viable arena for this country's professionals to make a living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But those same sources point to the problems that this kragdadigheid has caused in logistics and administration, both portfolios which Chalmers carried as commissioner on his own insistence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it is these areas - vital in the long- term success of any endeavour - that the sources claim the problems have begun to surface.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a matter though that the PGA will have to sort out for themselves.  They are certainly not going to air any linen - no matter how lily white it is - in public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But right now, the PGA will be run by its own executive, a board headed by no less a businessman than Johan Rupert. And Chalmers will be left to do what he does best, get out there and get the financial wheels turning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the job of tour commissioner that Chalmers has vacated? Doubtless someone will come forward from the pack to fill the high- profile position.  But right now, who wants to?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - National coach Clive Barker this week described Saturday's World Cup qualifying game against Zaire as the &quot;most important game of my life, and one that we can't lose under any circumstances&quot;. And most certainly this is the last chance that Barker and a few of his players will have of achieving their dream of playing in the World Cup finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defeat against an unpredictable Zaire will be a major blow to Bafana Bafana, who have never met the Central Africans before. However, it is expected that the visitors will bring most of their overseas contingent, based all over Europe, for this needle encounter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barker is well aware of the fact that only victory will be acceptable in each of South Africa's three home games, and that anything less will seriously dent, and maybe end, their chances of reaching the finals in France in 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A major cause for concern this week (and the future) is the form of captain and central defender, Neil Tovey, and whether the 34- year-old Kaizer Chiefs captain will last the pace until France. It definitely did not look that way when Chiefs were hammered 4-1 by Orlando Pirates in last week's Bob Save Superbowl semi- final, when Tovey was pulled all across the field by the Sea Robbers superman, Jerry Sikhosana. But there were not many defenders, or clubs that would have been able to control Sikhosana and Pirates on the day, and to single out Tovey would be a bit unfair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Tovey has warned that to write him off now would be foolhardy. &quot;All the criticism only makes me perform better, and I will prove them all wrong once again,&quot; he said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sikhosana's breathtaking peformances over the past week (he scored five goals in two games) has maybe secured his place in the starting line-up on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will also be interesting to see how Mark Fish copes after missing the Four Nations tournament. Though he is almost certain to be in the starting line-up, Fish has only played in the last three games for his Italian club Lazio, and his ability to last the pace for 90 minutes may be in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two players on whom a lot will hinge are midfielders Eric Tinkler and Linda Buthelezi, both of whom could play a major role against a Zairean side that is likely to employ robust tactics, in the same manner they did against Ghana in the quarterfinal of the Nations Cup, when their intention was clearly to kick the daylights out of the talented Ghanaians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This could well be the tactics they will adopt to unsettle the South Africans, but Barker has indicated that this is his strongest squad to date, and he will certainly be expecting them to produce their best.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Contrary to reports - including one in this paper last week - and information supplied by retrenched staff, Ravan Press is not closing its doors. Gerald de Villiers, executive chairman of Hodder &amp;Stoughton Educational and Ravan, writes:&quot;Yes, Ravan Press, in which Hodder has held a majority shareholding for several years, has recently been through a difficult period ... To stabilise the situation, we were left with no choice but to embark on a process of rationalisation. The fact that Ravan is now back on course is proof enough that our decision to act was the correct one.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ravan co-founder Peter Randall - and its first director, until he was banned in 1977 - also wrote to the Mail &amp;Guardian, contradicting the report of Ravan's demise and taking issue with some historical points made by Tony Morphet in his &quot;elegy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ravan, he says, was not a &quot;child of the Christian Institute&quot;, but &quot;an organic outgrowth of the Sprocas publishing programme&quot; and Randall &quot;declined foreign grants and donations during the fraught early years&quot;. He also says that the decision to publish JM Coetzee's Dusklands was not simply &quot;a moment of inspiration&quot;: &quot;My sober judgment was that this unsolicited manuscript by an unknown author, which had been rejected everywhere else, was the work of a writer of genius.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Randall writes that in his opinion Morphet's emphasis on the time during which Mike Kirkwood headed Ravan &quot;does rather trivialise Ravan's role Before Kirkwood and After Kirkwood. Before 1977 Ravan published seminal works and identified several significant new writers. After Kirkwood left ... it actively continued to contribute to South Africa's cultural and political life, and its titles won more awards than any other publisher in Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ravan recently published Jeremy Baskin's book on labour in South Africa, Against the Current, as well as a reissue of the Steve Biko collection, I Write What ILike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, as Randall points out, &quot;there is a list of forthcoming titles that includes familiar and distinguished names in South Africa's literary world.  Ravan will celebrate its 25th anniversary next September and a commemorative volume is being planned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So there's still some life in the old bird yet!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - LAST ORDERS by Graham Swift (Picador, R79,95)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It ain't like your regular sort of day.&quot; Not quite the opening line you expect from a Graham Swift novel, to date. But this new one, his sixth and this year's winner of the Booker Prize, ain't like your regular novel, Swift's or anyone else's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that the title, Last Orders, comes as a surprise. You wouldn't expect such a master of the terminal to opt for anything as upbeat as Opening Time.  His first novel ends with a dying widower waiting for his estranged daughter (The Sweet Shop Owner, 1980). His fifth concludes with another widower whose attempt to take his own life has recently failed (Ever After, 1992). You can understand a publisher choosing not to issue a new Graham Swift just in time for Christmas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is plenty of Swift's regular matter in Last Orders, that old- fashioned thing &quot;the family&quot;, its griefs and scars and vacancies. There is bereavement, remorse and guilt. Bombs and orphans. War in north Africa and on the North Sea. Photographs. A clock. A moron in a mental home. Some gallows humour. Plenty of full stops. Children are orphaned, adopted, abandoned, fugitive. Men are abashed at their own lack of manhood and envious of others.  And women? Quite a lot of question marks, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Orders reworks much of this matter in ingenious ways. Jack Dodds wants his ashes scattered off Margate pier, for instance, and we follow the route taken by four mourners, all men, from the Coach and Horses in Bermondsey.  Seventeen of the novel's 75 sections are headed with place names that flash up like road signs, or the stations of a more sacred progress. Old Kent Road.  New Cross. Blackheath. Dartford. And so on. Behind this journey there are secret histories and motives which it would spoil the fun to reveal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are two main features of Last Orders which mark this as a new venture for Swift. There is the social topography for a start, the jobs, the pubs, the jokes, the memories, a &quot;south London&quot; not like anything he has done before. The Bermondsey of Last Orders is a wonderfully dense little world, an extended family home made up of the things its inhabitants remember or cannot forget, from a mundane object like a clock above the bar to a wartime visit to a whorehouse in Cairo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not all the memories are equally shared or confided. The reader has to listen carefully for the sound of pieces falling together. Swift is good at this sort of suspense: Shuttlecock (1981) is, in its way, a small masterpiece.  Yet the only place in his fiction where you could find anything comparable to the tribal milieu of Last Orders, would be in the fens of Waterland (1983), that extraordinary compaction of historical, geological, social and economic elements on which the mere personal stories of Tom, Dick, Harry and Mary seem to float.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Waterland also had a here-and-now Greenwich, from which the ageing Tom Crick looked back with longing and remorse. The new thing about Last Orders is that, for the first time, Swift provides no escape from the old home, no eminence supported by class or money or education, however precarious or equivocal. Neither for his main characters nor, overtly at least, for his reader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other distinctive feature is that Swift has found new freedoms for the spoken voice. Spare a thought for the translators standing by to turn this into the &quot;more than 20 languages&quot; boasted by the dust jacket. This will be a bleeding sight more trouble than the others. Not that the shortest section should be a problem, consisting as it does of the mere exclamation - entirely dramatic in context - &quot;Old buggers&quot;. I imagine this passes easily enough into more than 20 languages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there are colloquial rhythms and rhymes that will fox and elude. The wry little pleasures his characters take in speaking or thinking of &quot;beef and grief&quot;, &quot;pork and talk&quot;, &quot;Neville the devil&quot;, &quot;Gunner Tate, middleweight.  Always pissed, always late&quot;. Or the poetry hidden in the name (and nature) of Ray, the novel's leading character, which quietly erupts, just once, with exquisite timing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So much of Swift's previous writing has seemed so, well, written. What a relief to find here such sprightly dialogue, clipped and laconic and humorous.  It grows from a real sense of these characters knowing each other, and growing old together. The internal monologues, too, sound less irretrievably split off from the realm of live speech than in the previous novels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That severance had come to seem Swift's favoured formal position: the guiltily brooding, ageing male, endlessly confessing his solitary need to be loved, the impossibility of speaking out and being heard, though once upon a time ... How refreshing at last to find him opening a new bag of tricks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The telling of Last Orders is shared by no less than seven voices, five male and two female, six alive and one dead. The most prominent belongs to little Ray Johnson, insurance clerk, gambler and jockey manqu_. The next most frequently heard is that of Vince the motor-dealer. You could say that these two share the role of the fraught male figure on whom Swift's novels have always been centred, the failed son who is even more of a failing father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jack's widow Amy is given a large chance to be heard. This is particularly welcome, given that Amy's is the role of the desirable wife-and-mother around whom the men all revolve. In Swift's other novels this figure has seemed intractably paralysed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ever After, the narrator imagining his remote Victorian kinsman reflects: &quot;I give to Matthew's life that very quality of benign design that he had already glimpsed might be lacking from the universe.&quot; Like all good novelists, Swift at once yearns for benign design and mistrusts it. For Last Orders he has invented an ingenious design that seems, for once, to make itself happen.  This is a rare kind of craft.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - There are two sides to any story and it is easy to criticise, but when sitting in film producer Chris Roland's office listening to him wax eloquent about &quot;the project&quot;; you are drawn by his enthusiasm, his passion about rave (blanket concept, no sub-genres) and the collective consciousness's role in healing the planet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roland is the producer of Critical Mass, the movie which will be shot in Cape Town in March next year. It's financed with Canadian money and co- produced by C-Films (the company that produced Kalahari Harry); as well as an organiser of the upcoming Critical Mass rave &quot;starring&quot; Sid Shanti.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critical Mass is the story of Chase Ryan ,who is disillusioned by the rave scene and sets off on a vision quest to bring together a bunch of people &quot;in a trance dance free of commercialism and drugs&quot;. But Critical Mass is more than just a movie, it is a commercial venture that has a philosophy behind it.  Roland believes the message - unity and eco-friendliness - needs to be spread in order for us to reach &quot;critical mass&quot;. In his terms, when we can finally come together and work toward creating a better planet. The Critical Mass venture also includes plans for a record label and franchisable internet cafes, which may sound a bit like a case of hugging your dolphin and eating it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Roland met up with Wayne Lehrer, the writer/director of Critical Mass in Los Angeles and the idea first surfaced, Lehrer was determined to produce it outside Hollywood as he felt studio influence would compromise the message of the picture. It was then that Roland, working in South Africa at that time, suggested they produce it here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roland is determined this film will help destroy some of the stereotypes associated with raves - for instance that people just go out, take drugs and dance. He talks of the new way this generation has of communicating, not through words and concepts, but through music and celebration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dirk de Villiers, while pouring me a whisky (&quot;the kind of spirits I'm an expert on&quot;), comments on an insert aired on The Works about the Desert Storm rave, &quot;When I have a couple of whiskies I may slur a bit, but those guys, hell they talk a lot of nonsense&quot;. De Villiers has been around and obviously recognises the potential of the project, stressing how much he believes in the film's spiritual message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it will be shot here, the name of the city it takes place in is never mentioned. This upsets most of us, the &quot;Sydney Poitier could never do justice to Nelson&quot; syndrome. But we must realise the script originates in America and its audience is there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This explains its tagline &quot;Generation X is about to get a voice&quot;. If I was a raver I'd be sceptical of any enterprise with a flyer insinuating I was a member of Generation X. That's like old guys in hush puppies who dig Winona Ryder. But it seems the term has become all-encompassing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are many blatant Americanisms in the film synopsis but perhaps throwing raves here prior to the filming will bring the project into context.  Then again, maybe not. Perhaps we should not demand this as it's the film- maker's dream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So why throw a rave before shooting the film? The Cape Town International Film Market runs from November 13 to 17 and the rave is on the 15th. Although financing is &quot;wrapped up&quot;, the producers remain anxious to broadcast their confidence in the picture. This is evidenced in the rave flyer which describes a company with some money to raise (no sin) and also one that is truly trying to maintain contact with it's target audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late one night I bump into one of the alleged organisers of the rave (when a rave looms in Cape Town everyone is involved in the organisation on some blurry level). I ask: &quot;What do you think of the script ?&quot; &quot;I haven't read it, I'm just helping organise the rave.&quot; Then I ask about the critical mass concept, uniting the collective consciousness, trying to make a difference? &quot; Fuck I don't know&quot; is the reply, &quot;that's got nothing to do with me. I just make sure everything works, it's going to be wicked, excellent lights man, and Sid Shanti and all, I can't wait.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday afternoon I overhear a conversation in a deli (when a rave looms everyone talks about it in Cape Town). &quot;All these organisers are the same man, like a paedophile waving candy to a baby.&quot; &quot;Yeah, it's like do they really expect us to take this Nostradamus, celestine prophecy stuff seriously, it's just another rave, we all know that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critical Mass defines Generation X as the rave generation, which may not be entirely true and claims it is about to give us a voice. I always felt that this generation, this rave generation was (just as they claim on the flyer), an extension of what was awakened in the Sixties. That part of its desire was not to have a voice. Not to become part of the establishment noise they fight against. To communicate through music and unity and celebrate life. This is what Chase Ryan in the movie does, celebrates unity in &quot;a trance dance free of commercialism and drugs&quot;, after which he probably grabs a dolphin-free tuna sandwich at any critical mass cyber cafe and listens to the latest critical mass records release.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - 'One must be absolutely mad to want to be on it. After all, this is the body people love to hate. With those sagacious words, Judge Albie Sachs ends what has become one of more sanguine features of post-apartheid South Africa: a press conference that - compared with the poker-faced briefings presided over by representatives of the previous government - is more like a cosy chat.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another feature of these fireside-type press sessions is the prevalence of feel-good terminology like &quot;transparency, accountability and democracy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have gathered in the judge's chambers to be briefed on the transparent, accountable and democratic processes involved in selecting members of the most powerful cultural body ever constituted in South Africa - the National Arts Council (NAC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the chairmanship of Sachs, a selection panel of representatives from different cultural sectors will interview the candidates for membership of this coveted (or accursed, if Sachs's words are to be taken seriously) council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From 33 names shortlisted from over 100, between 14 and 22 contenders will be forwarded to the Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, Lionel Mtshali. In addition, nine candidates will be submitted by provincial MECs for culture to the minister, for seats on the NAC, in order to ensure broad representation countrywide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Councillors will serve on this &quot;independent&quot; body on an honorary basis for a three-year term and will be eligible for re-appointment after a further three years have lapsed. The NAC will receive R10-million in its first year, R20-million in the second and R30- million in its third year. But while the council will meet only three times a year to arbitrate and channel funds, smaller advisory panels revolving around the different creative disciplines will meet regularly to thrash out ongoing cultural and funding issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Sachs suggests that the NAC selection procedure will be nothing short of a return to cultural Camelot - &quot;an impeccable, transparent example of democracy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equally imperative will be the kinds of questions put to the candidates.  These will determine whether the NAC hearings become something akin to a mad hatter's tea party, a modern-day inquisition or a cosy cabal of consensus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who exactly are these custodians of cultural correctitude? Sachs describes the selection panel as representing a broad cross-section of South Africans &quot; united in their love of and commitment to the cause of culture&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They include Darryl Accone, editor of The Star Tonight; artist and director for the Africus Institute of Contemporary Art (AICA) Bongi Dhlomo-Mautloa; Anton Hamersma from the Standard Bank Investment Corporation; Dr Nomani Magau who is both a poet and a member of the Centre For Policy and Information at the Development Bank of South Africa; vice- chancellor and rector of the University of the North, Professor Njabulo Ndebele and rector of the University of South Africa, Professor Marius Wiechers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The selection panel will be looking for NAC members who will not bring with them a conflict of interests,&quot; explains Sachs. &quot;They want people with cultural imagination, experience and vision.&quot; And, possibly, more than a hint of madness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Open hearings for National Arts Council candidates take place in Johannesburg this Friday and Monday at the Carlton Hotel</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The shutters hide the glory of the venue's past. The venue is the Eyethu cinema in Mofolo central, Soweto, and the death of the cinema represents the end of a movie-going era. This is the cinema where liberal film distributors in the 1970s held black premi...res of major Hollywood movies like The Wild Geese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's an era that was effectively killed by the multi-screen movie houses which, in the past, were not open to black people. Racially integrated entertainment spaces also marked the end of backroom township movie theatres, where an enterprising businessman could rent a 16mm film and show it in his garage.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nowadays the film-going experience has become quite loaded. No longer does it cost one 50c piece for a double feature before heading straight back home.  Now it is probably preceded by a meal and followed by a stop for coffee. More and more black people are converting to this new religion. When did the change happen? For Mpho Serobe of Ster Moribo - the only black-owned chain of local cinemas - the change started when people began realising that they have a choice as to what kind of movie experience is on offer. &quot;You can give people a crate to sit on and if they don't have an alternative they will take the crate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems that the old era is gone forever; Eyethu has given way to the shopping mall. For Serobe, however, this is just the beginning of the mission to Africanise movie-going: &quot;Cinemas should reflect the culture of the people that they serve.&quot; For him, one of the most unacceptable features about modern, Westernised cinema is the practice of reserving seats. &quot;While it has been taken as sophisticated to reserve seats, it is not in synch with the broader community whose culture doesn't require such practices.&quot; So there aren't any seat reservation facilities in any of seven cinemas owned by Ster Moribo.  Because of this, Serobe thinks that most people are more comfortable with using these cinemas than others in town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He thinks &quot;cinema should move towards an African experience&quot; - an experience that is not about entering a dark, cold cinema with people who want to be left alone, but &quot;where you feel comfortable to come with a group of friends, clap if you want to&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While one might realistically be able to offer that kind of experience, what matters, ultimately, is what kind of celluloid image you choose to flicker on that silver screen. Is it the usual, made-in-America fantasy or are other types of motion pictures shown at Ster Moribo - movies made in Africa for instance? &quot;African people have shown that they are tolerant of other cultures,&quot; says Serobe, adding that they are quite open to watching Hollywood movies, but believes they would, by the same measure, be equally open to watching movies like Senegalese film- maker Djibril Diop Mambety's art classic Hyenas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To get more people watching movies like these from Africa, Serobe believes that a process of education should be taking place: &quot;We will sample them in between the mainstream movies so that people can acquire that taste.&quot; It would indeed seem that this &quot;sampling&quot; will be part of a long, slow process because Hyenas did not do at all well during its run at Ster Moribo cinemas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If people are open to seeing African movies, why did they not go to one that received such vociferous critical acclaim? &quot;Hyenas is an art house movie from Africa, we would have to test that theory (that African movies inherently don't do well in South African cinemas) by comparing it to an African action film,&quot; says Serobe. &quot;We tried to show an art movie in an action cinema.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While people might be open to different African cinema experiences, those experiences might not be readily available. Precious few features emerge from Africa each year when compared to the West. &quot;In the absence of these movies, there is nothing wrong with using the experience of our black brothers and sisters from America.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ster Moribo cinemas are the ones where viewers will be able to see more black American-produced and starred-in movies than anywhere else. Movies like the gruesomely violent Hughes brothers production Dead Presidents have done extremely well in places like the Dobsonville Ster Moribo cinemas. And so has Waiting to Exhale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to experimenting with these movies, Ster Moribo's inner-city Johannesburg Carlton cinemas will be hosting this year's Gay and Lesbian Film Festival. But if Hyenas was a niche art house film, gay and lesbian films will more than likely prove to be even more so. This, for Serobe, is yet another way of introducing new tastes to his core audience. &quot;The gay and lesbian community is going to campaign around people who are gay and encourage sympathisers to come and see these movies. In this way we are going to be building another market,&quot; he says. &quot;That is a step in the right direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Former national team coach, Samuel &quot;Zoom&quot; Ndhlovu, has been hounded out of his coaching job with Botswana's Centre Chief's while the future of Fred Mwila as that country's Under-20 national team coach is said to be hanging in the balance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a Zambian journalist working on Botswana's The Mmegi , Sam Kapodza, Ndhlovu was forced to hand in his resignation a few weeks ago after club officials complained about his team's poor performance while the Botswana Football Association (BFA) is considering replacing Mwila with a German following a string of losses by the Young Zebras.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People here are very sensitive. They demand for the sacking of the coach immediately a team starts recording negative results,&quot; observed Kapodza in a telephone interview from Gaborone, Botswana, adding: &quot;For instance, it's not Mwila's fault that the team has been performing badly. He has been having difficulties in getting all the players at the same time.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwila's woes began last month after the Young Zebra's crushed 1-3 and 1-2 to Angola and South Africa respectively during international friendlies to mark Botswana's national day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But technical adviser to BFA, Ben Koufie, yesterday denied that there were plans to fire Mwila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's not correct. I have no intentions of firing Mwila. Yes, the team has performed badly but I have no intentions of firing him,&quot; Koufie said in a telephone interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On reports that the BFA intends to hire a German coach to take over the coaching of the Under-20 national team, Koufie replied: &quot;That is within the premises of the BFA. We have embarked on a three year development programme by hiring foreign coaches.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kapodza further disclosed that former national team defence pillar Dickson Makwaza, currently coaching premier division side, Botswana Meat Corporation (BMC) FC, could also lose his job following a decline on fortunes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;BMC did very well last season but because of poor performance this season, they are baying for his blood,&quot; Kapodza said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - A 19-man squad, comprising the very cream of Zambian soccer, left yesterday aboard a chartered Aero Zambia flight for the Congolese coastal city of Pointe-Noire, ahead of this Sunday's World Cup encounter against Congo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, according to soccer commentator Dennis Liwewe, who is with the team in Pointe-Noire, the squad has been accomodated in a third rate hotel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that it took five hours before the team was given rooms at the Hotel Noveau which only offers bed and breakfast. The only meal that the team had during the five hour wait were sandwiches.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liwewe also disclosed that national team coach, Roald Poulsen, and his assistants, Patrick Phiri and Benjamin Bwalya have been seperated from the rest of the team due to a shortage of rooms at Hotel Noveau and, as a result, missed training yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The humid and rather hot coastal weather is also said to be another matter of concern but, according to Liwewe, the morale in the squad is very high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to departure, Poulsen expressed confidence that he has the fire power to make the Congolese eat humble pie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With these players we have, we will do everything possible. What we need is a fighting spirit for this game,&quot; Poulsen said adding that he may consider changing the heavily criticised 3-5-2 formation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His deputy, Kalusha's elder brother, Benjamin, added: &quot;We have got good players who can do the job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team includes Zanaco protege, Dabwitso Nkhoma, Kenneth &quot;Bubble&quot; Malitoli, long-legged John Lungu, Zamsure lynchpin Andrew Tembo, professional Joel Bwalya and Emanuel Siwale. Hilary Makasa, who missed the Mozambique Africa Cup encounter returns to join towering Elijah Litana, Allan Kamwanga, Jones Mwewa and hardman Mordon Malitoli.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To finish up things is nimble footed Dennis Lota and Mwape Miti while Davies Phiri, Collins Mbulo and Stephen Zimba will alternate in minding the net.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - A slump in activity has been recorded on the Lusaka Stock Exchange and brokers are attributing it to the uncertainties caused by this month's presidential and parliamentary elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pangaea Partners managing director, Mebeelo Mutukwa, in an interview on Tuesday, disclosed that there had been reduced activity on the stock exchange as most people were holding back from trading until after elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Naturally at a time like this the people hold on to their funds,&quot; Mutukwa explained. &quot;They are reluctant to invest in securities and assets for now.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutukwa explained that despite the people's interest in investment most of them were waiting to see what would happen to the exchange rates after the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutukwa, however, said the situation was not as bad as people may have anticipated as there is still some considerable level of trades going on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week's LuSE Weekly Stock News recorded a total of 20 trades for five of the six listed companies, amounting to only K970,419.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the same category of companies a total of 64,729 shares were traded involving Chilanga Cement, Farmers House, Rothmans and Zambia Sugar Plc except for ZCCM which last traded on LuSE on May 13 this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other trades for the quoted companies on LuSE recorded 36 trades with a value of over K1.4 million, bringing the sum total of both groups trades to K2.4 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambia Sugar share price dropped K15 to K12 per share, making the current share price only K1 higher than the public offer price of K11 earlier in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But among shares on offer Bata Zambia Limited is offering a huge volume of 2 million shares at K10 per share while 20,000 of Zambia Sugar shares are on offer at K14 per share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other companies are Farmers House with 355,219 shares on offer at K240 per share and an additional 199,700 at K260 per share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And demand for cement both locally and in the regional markets has risen, enabling Chilanga Cement to operate its plants at full capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite the improved demand for cement, the Chilanga Cement share price has remained at K53, lower than the offer price of K54 when the company floated its shares.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - There was despair at Lusaka International Air port as over 91 Malian illegal immigrants were deported by the Zambian government yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The immigrants, some of whom have been remanded in custody at Lusaka Central and Kamwala Remand prisons, were yesterday bundled out of the country under heavy guard as their helpless wives and children, who couldn't travel with them, looked on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Immigration Department's spokesperson, Catherine Poso, the repatriation exercise was fully financed by the Malian government who had chartered a 300 seater Ethiopian Airlines' Boeing 767 aircraft to ferry the immigrants together with their Zambian spouses and children to Mali.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are repatriating about 91 Malian illegal immigrants, including those who have volunteered to travel back to Mali including their Zambian wives and children willing to travel,&quot; Poso said. &quot;The whole exercise is fully financed by the Malian government but the problem is that there is limited space on the plane.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The detained immigrants were not even given chance to say bye to their Zambian wives but were bundled away immediately to the departure lounge after they arrived at the airport in two police trucks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The development has, however, spelt doom for the families that have been left behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know what is going to happen me. The authorities have only allowed my husband and my two children to go and the problem is that I don't work and was fully dependant on my husband,&quot;moaned Catherine Siamuleya Jawala in an interview yesterday at Lusaka International airport yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Brenda Ngosa of Ndola said she would wait for her husband to return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All I can only do is just to wait for him and he has promised to return and look after us,&quot; said Brenda, a mother of one, in an interview yesterday as she sobbed away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the women, however, complained that the Malian government acted unfairly by giving them very little notice as most of them wanted to travel with their husbands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were only told about this two days ago and some of us leave outside town, by the time we came to register (for the repatriation) they had closed,&quot; Catherine carped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poso also disclosed that the Malian government took up the decision to finance the repatriation exercise after it was learnt that the country had the highest number of illegal immigrants remanded in Zambian jails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some illegal immigrants, who have found life rather difficult in Zambia, voluntarily gave themselves in for repatriation. But others were turned away due to the limited capacity of the chartered plane.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Regulation of the media in the coverage of the 1996 presidential and general elections has been criticised by the Zambia Independent Media Associati-on(ZIMA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZIMA chairman, David Simpson, in a press statement released in Lusaka yesterday said that &quot;The Electoral (Conduct) Regulations 1996 are a reasonable attempt to create the conditions for free and fair elections.  However, they appear to have been issued in a hurry, and without consultation with media organisations, and some issues therefore remain unclear.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simpson also said &quot;the question of fair and balanced reporting is open to individual interpretation by the courts&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Electoral Commission have emphasised on the media election rules which bar the press from speculating on the results of the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All media shall devise an election results programme which shall keep the electorate up to date with the progress of the vote-counting process and shall avoid unfounded speculations which may cause instability and shall broadcast confirmed election results as they become available,&quot; the statutory instrument reads in part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) yesterday criticised the producer of Open Fire, a ZNBC television programme, for unparalleled bias through censorship of their party member,Chuulu Kalima's comments on the status of the health system in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But ZNBC controller of programmes, Frank Mutubila, yesterday defended himself citing the electoral regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Electoral Commission has made the rules clear and I am not going to abandon ethics. There are regulations to political programmes and that programme is about issues,&quot; Mutubila said. &quot;From the time he arrived, Chuulu Kalima made it clear that he was there to politick and was not interested in the issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But ZDC general secretary, Derrick Chitala, described Mutubila as having been &quot;absolutely unprofessional&quot; in his role as moderator by heavily censoring Kalima's speech to the point where he &quot;looked like Mickey Mouse&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is an MMD cadre and it showed,&quot; Chitala charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chitala also condemned Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT) president, Alfred Zulu, for predicting the winner of elections as MMD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was against the electoral code of conduct,&quot; Chitala charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Zulu rebutted the accusations saying; &quot;We can give an opinion about the electoral process without being partisan. We are standing on the middle of the road and persuading the electoral commission to follow international norms. Elections are human rights issues and ZIMT as a civic human rights NGO has a mandate and responsibility to freely comment on the political democratic process of our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't do anything in contravention of the electoral code. We can state technicalities.We are not flouting anything ,&quot; Zulu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chitala, however, maintained his party will not cooperate with ZIMT in any way but hoped the code of conduct would ensure fair coverage of the opposition parties by the government media.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Tanzania Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA) has dismissed claims by the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) that 19,000 tonnes of its copper is held up on their rail-line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is not true,&quot;TAZARA marketing director Joseph Minsula said in an interview in Lusaka yesterday. &quot;What I know is that 10,000 tonnes of copper are en-route to Dar-es-Salaam from the Copperbelt and that tonnage is moving.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Minsula, the 10,000 tonnes of copper has taken about a month to reach the Zamcargo depot in Dar-es-Salaam, when it was supposed to take about seven days. He denied the possibility of the delay being caused by industrial unrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Workers' strikes occurred in April and have nothing to do with this. There is no way we could operate on 30 wagons,&quot; he said referring to information released by Musonda on Wednesday that only 30 wagons were being used to transport copper and these had now been increased to 60.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZCCM, in its Wednesday press statement, revealed that it was having cash flow problems because of 19,000 tonnes of held-up copper on the TAZARA line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZCCM public relations manager, Francis Musonda, yesterday clarified his position and said that 10, 384 tonnes were en-route to Dar-es-Salaam. He said 8,616 tonnes of copper &quot;is still marooned at different stations along the TAZARA line on the Zambian side waiting to be hauled to the border for entry into Tanzania&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International speculation is rife that ZCCM might be holding on to their stocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conglomerate announced that it had sold about 400,000 tonnes of copper in 1995 though some copper was still in transit to clients in the Far East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TAZARA admitted to having had operational problems but said these were &quot;now over&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We expect that over 90 per cent of the 10,000 tonnes will be delivered over the weekend. As from midnight last night to 11:00 hours this morning we will be delivering 75 wagons of copper into Dar-es-Salaam. The last train with 32 wagons is arriving at 11:00 hours,&quot; Minsula said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Commonwealth Boxing Council (CBC) has issued an ultimatum to the Commonwealth Light Welterweight champion, Andy Holligan, for him to face Zambian contender, Felix &quot;The Hammer&quot; Bwalya, or be stripped of his title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holligan was supposed to make a mandatory defence of his title against Bwalya on October 11 this year but weeks before the fight, the Briton claimed he had suffered an injury during training.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But CBC secretary, Simon Block, in a letter to Holligan's manager, Stephen Vaughan, and copied to the Zambia Professional Boxing Board of Control (ZPBBC) and Bwalya's manager, Yusuf Seedat, dated October 31, 1996 noted that &quot; Bwalya's people have been remarkably patient but I think the time has come now when he must be given the opportunity he has earned, as mandated by the Commonwealth Boxing Council&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Block also stressed that Holligan's camp gives him &quot;information about when Andy Holligan will be in a position to meet his Commonwealth Light Welterweight Championship obligation against Felix Bwalya&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would be grateful if you would advise me as a matter of urgency the current position,&quot; Block writes. &quot;I also hope Andy has fully recovered and will soon be in a position to box again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, many boxing analysts feel Holligan is ducking Bwalya because of his awesome record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a possibilty that Holligan's camp is trying not to endanger their boxer by facing a tough fighter like Felix,&quot; observed renowned boxing match maker, James, Mulenga, while another observer remarked: &quot;Holligan knows he doesn't stand a chance in hell against Bwalya hence the excuse of being injured.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview yesterday, Bwalya expressed frustration over the delay in facing Holligan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have been training for the last six months and it's becoming frustrating, &quot; Bwalya complained. &quot;I want to get it over and done with.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tunis - In an address to the Tunisian people on the occasion of the ninth anniversary of the Change of November 7, 1987, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali reaffirmed the importance Tunisia attaches in its overall development to the complementarity between its economic and social dimensions: &quot;Our development policies translate the Tunisian society's propensity for moderation and the sense of measure, so that we never favored one dimension to the detriment of another, or one group or region at the expense of another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have worked to achieve coherence and balance between the political, economic, and social reforms in the belief that developing any one of those aspects at the expense of the others is doomed to end in imbalance and lead to division and disparity&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ben Ali reviewed in his speech the economic and social results achieved in such areas as employment, health, and housing. He emphasized the importance of the current stage as a transition period between two development plans, one in which structural reforms were completed and a coming stage (1997-2001) which will prepare Tunisians for the next century. &quot; That is why we have integrated the Ninth Plan within a long-term approach by carrying out preliminary strategic studies that have covered the different sectors and dimensions related to the achievement of sustainable development,&quot; he said in his speech.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - Human Rights Watch/Africa today called upon the international community to guarantee protection to the refugees in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The human rights organization stated that to coerce them to return to unsafe situations in their home countries amounts to refoulement, which is a clear violation of international refugee law. &quot;The international community cannot solve the humanitarian crisis in eastern Zaire by sacrificing the basic rights of refugees to avoid being forcibly returned to countries where they have cause to fear persecution,&quot; according to Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch/Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the same time, those persons suspected of involvement in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda as well as those now engaged in armed attacks against Rwanda and Burundi must be excluded from the protection afforded to legitimate refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donor governments, the UNHCR, and some aid organizations hope that the current desperate conditions in Zaire will drive most refugees to return, thus ending the problem of the refugee camps. The camps have been a source of insecurity because the former Rwandan army and militia have used them as bases from which to launch armed incursions into Rwanda.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those responsible for the genocide continue to control the camps, spurring hopes for a return to Rwanda by force and using terror and intimidation to discourage voluntary repatriation. One of the strategies currently being proposed by the United States and the UNHCR is to provide food and medical services within the refugees' home countries so as to attract the refugees back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While repatriation is an appropriate option for some of the refugees, it must be a voluntary process. Although migrants can be forcibly returned to their home countries, international law prohibits forcibly returning genuine refugees. Many of those who fled Rwanda and Burundi have legitimate grounds to fear persecution, given the nonfunctioning judicial systems and continuing military attacks on civilians, as described below. Given this, and in the absence of screening procedures to determine which of the migrants formally qualify as refugees, the presumption must be that all are refugees -- that is, that no forcible return is permitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Positive steps by Rwanda and Burundi to improve respect for human rights and ensure that the killing of civilians stops and that those responsible for past and present killings of civilians are investigated, tried with full respect for due process, and punished would certainly persuade more refugees to return voluntarily. Assurances that the international community would provide long-term monitoring of their situations should they return would also increase the likelihood of substantial numbers of people returning of their own volition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those suspected of genocide and crimes against humanity, like those involved in military activity against the governments of the home countries, have no right to the status of refugee and should be excluded from such status. Despite the difficulties in identifying the killers, mechanisms must be put in place to screen out those suspected of genocide from genuine refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are thousands of legitimate refugees in Zaire and many of them fear returning to Rwanda or Burundi because of insecurity: assassinations, disappearances, and attacks by military or militia on civilians. Those slaughtered by the Burundian army and militia affiliated with it number in the thousands this year, while some 600 civilians have been killed this year by Rwandan soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In general, military authorities in Rwanda and Burundi refuse to acknowledge abuses on the part of their soldiers, often falsely asserting that the civilians were in fact infiltrators or their accomplices or that they were accidentally slain in an exchange of fire with infiltrators. In a rare and welcome departure from this policy, in late October a military officer in Burundi admitted that soldiers in the southern province of Bururi had massacred some fifty civilians and said that soldiers responsible would be punished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees also fear arbitrary arrest to be followed by an apparently limitless period of detention without trial -- as is the case in Rwanda, where 83,000 languish in inhumane conditions -- or by trial under conditions that fail to meet international standards of justice, as was recently the case in Burundi, where eighty-nine persons were sentenced to death and thirty- nine to life imprisonment without having had access to defense counsel.  Initially lacking both the money and the personnel needed to begin trials, the Rwandan government is now adequately supplied with the necessary resources to start proceedings. A law adopted on September 1 divides perpetrators of genocide into different categories and assigns punishments for each. The government is conducting an information campaign to inform prisoners of the details of the law and to give them opportunities to confess, in return for which some may receive reduced sentences. This procedure should finish by the end of the year and the Rwandan government should be ready to begin trials by early January at the latest. Implementing the genocide law in a manner that ensures trials or release for all detainees within a reasonable time is essential to avoid creating legitimate fears of arbitrary detention among refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to guard against arbitrary detention based on false or unsupported allegations of complicity in the genocide, the Rwandan government should establish prompt judicial review of all detentions. In addition, to assure that those detained face trial within the near future, the government should announce the date when the trials of those accused of genocide will begin, and provide concrete information about the proceedings and provisions being made for defense counsel. To address the refugees' fears of attacks by the Rwandan military once they return to their home communes, the government must acknowledge and condemn killings by the military and begin investigation and prosecution of those responsible. Since the military courts are functioning, these trials should begin immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Rwandan refugees also fear that they will have no home or no fields to plant if they return; they fear that if they find their property occupied and attempt to regain it, they may be imprisoned on false charges of genocide.  Soon after the establishment of the current government, it set up property commissions to resolve conflicts between returned refugees and squatters who had occupied their property, but such commissions have been unable to resolve most such disputes. The Rwandan government should increase the resources and authority of such commissions so that they are able to guarantee the rights of the returned refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To help assure the security of those who return, the international community must commit itself to engage in long-term monitoring of refugees in their home communes. The most appropriate mechanism available to conduct such monitoring would be the United Nations Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda, which has a mandate &quot;to monitor the ongoing human rights situation, and through their presence help redress existing problems and prevent possible human rights violations from occurring.&quot; Deploying the additional human rights officers needed to monitor the return of the refugees will require significant new resources, but this cost is far less than what would be needed to provide continuing assistance for people too fearful of persecution to return home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those legitimate refugees who choose to remain in Zaire, however, must not be deprived of the essentials of life in order to force them to repatriate; to engage in a program of selective feeding and offer them food only if they return to Rwanda would be the equivalent of refoulement, a practice prohibited by international refugee law. The international community did nothing to stop Burundi from forcibly returning some 80,000 refugees to Rwanda in July and August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those refugees have been generally well-received in Rwanda, but their relatively trouble-free return does not excuse the practice or make it acceptable as a model for the current situation. Nor does it eliminate grounds for fear among the refugees now in Zaire. In the absence of the establishment of the rule of law through a denunciation of arbitrary killing, the investigation and prosecution of those responsible, and the creation of a mechanism to avoid arbitrary detention, there is nothing to prevent the Rwandan authorities from persecuting returning refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In delivering assistance to those who decide to stay in Zaire, the UNHCR and aid organizations must exclude those suspected of genocide or crimes against humanity and those involved in military activity against their home governments. Despite the inherent difficulties in identifying the killers and conducting effective screening, the international community should seize the opportunity provided by the movement of large numbers of the refugees and the possibility that international troops might be deployed in the region to attempt to separate the killers from the general refugee population. Those indicted by international or national courts, and those who held command responsibility in either the civilian or military structures of the former Rwandan government or in the militia should not receive aid and they must not be able to take control again of refugee camps. At a minimum, arms should not be permitted in any camp where humanitarian aid is going to be provided. If new camps are established, they should be located a sufficient distance away from the international borders to prevent them posing a threat to neighboring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international community has thus far failed in its obligation to bring to justice persons charged with genocide. It was slow in providing the needed resources for the International Tribunal for Rwanda to begin its work. It has allowed Cameroon to delay for months in delivering Col. Theonest Bagosora, the most important leader indicted, to the custody of the Tribunal in Arusha.  It has done nothing about establishing an international tribunal to investigate and try cases of genocide and crimes against humanity in Burundi, although the United Nations Commission of Inquiry found that acts of genocide had been committed there. The international community, including neighboring states, must be reminded of the importance of cooperating with the Tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the UNHCR, donor governments, and aid organizations determine that an armed force is necessary to permit delivery of humanitarian assistance, such a force must include the protection of human rights in its mandate. At the very least, any such force must have the authority to locate and detain persons suspected of leading the genocide in order to deliver them to the International Tribunal or national courts. The lesson of UNPROFOR in Bosnia clearly demonstrates the futility of an international force with a mandate only to feed people but not to protect them from violence. Thus, if a force is deployed, it should be mandated and adequately equipped to protect and promote human rights within its zone, including protecting the civilians from attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international community has not taken seriously its efforts to control the flow of arms to this region. Although the UN established a commission to investigate allegations that arms were being delivered to the forces of the former Rwandan government in violation of a UN arms embargo, it has done nothing to act on the findings of the commission. In fact, the Security Council is currently deciding whether or not to release the commission's report, which deals with arms transfers as well as issues directly relating to the genocide and the current crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presence of former Rwandan soldiers and militia in eastern Zaire has exacerbated pre-existing hostility against Zairians ethnically related to the Tutsi of Rwanda and Burundi. Former Rwandan soldiers and militia reportedly joined in attacks on Zairian Tutsi in North Kivu six months ago as well as in more recent attacks on the Banyamulenge of South Kivu. The actions of the Zairian parliament in declaring that Tutsi should be removed from government employment, the statement of the Deputy Governor of South Kivu that all Tutsi must leave within one week or face attack, and the participation of Zairian military in attacks on Tutsi or their failure to stop such violence by civilians have created fears that the government will permit or itself engage in large-scale killings of Tutsi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bands of civilians, sometimes with official support, have already driven Tutsi from their homes and pillaged their property in Kinshasa as well as in eastern Zaire. Zairian political leaders and interest groups maintain that the people attacked are transplanted Rwandans, although they were born in Zaire and some of them descend from families that have lived there for centuries. The government of Zaire must recognize the right to nationality and must cease denationalizing Banyamulenge and other people ethnically related to Tutsi who qualify for Zairian citizenship. The government of Zaire is responsible for the safety of all civilians within its borders, regardless of their citizenship, and must take measures to ensure that military and civilian authorities provide such protection. Recommendations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Security Council, UNHCR, international donor countries and international aid agencies:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Guarantee the right of legitimate refugees to protection from forcible repatriation and ensure that humanitarian supplies are provided in Zaire for those legitimate refugees who decide not to return to their home countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Institute screening procedures in Zaire to exclude from refugee status those suspected of genocide or crimes against humanity and armed combatants.  At a minimum, prohibit arms from any camp where humanitarian assistance is being provided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Publish immediately the UN Commission of Inquiry's report on arms flows, and undertake to act on its conclusions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Put pressure on the governments of Rwanda and Burundi to ensure that returning refugees are protected from killing, arbitrary arrest, and harassment. Work with these governments to see that immediate steps are taken to encourage voluntary repatriation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Pressure the government of Rwanda to begin trials of those accused of genocide by the first of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Pressure the government of Burundi to institute immediate reforms of its judicial system to comply with international standards of due process and fairness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Pressure the governments of Rwanda and Burundi to bring to trial those soldiers responsible for serious human rights abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Ensure that if camps are re-opened, that they be situated a reasonable distance from the Rwandan and Burundian borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Zairian government:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The government of Zaire should officially restore the citizenship of the Banyamulenge and other persons said to be &quot;Tutsi&quot; who qualified for citizenship prior to the 1981 law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Zairian civilian and military authorities from the highest levels down must acknowledge and condemn all attacks against civilians. Zairian soldiers and civilians responsible for attacks and looting throughout Zaire, as well as all those responsible for attacks against Tutsi throughout the country, should be investigated and brought to justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Rwandan government:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The government should announce the date when the trials of those accused of genocide will begin, and provide concrete information about the proceedings and provisions being made for defense counsel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The government must acknowledge and condemn killings by the military and immediately begin investigation and prosecution of those responsible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The government should increase the resources and authority of property commissions so that they are able to guarantee the rights of the returned refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the Burundi government:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The government must acknowledge and condemn killings by the military and immediately begin investigation and prosecution of those responsible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The government should institute reforms of the judicial system to comply with international standards of due process and fairness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the United Nations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Publish immediately the report of the commission's reports on arms flows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Provide additional human and material resources for the UN Human Rights Field Operations in Rwanda and Burundi, so they are able to conduct long-term monitoring of the situation of returning refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Create an ad hoc tribunal to try genocide and crimes against humanity in Burundi, since it is highly unlikely that domestic courts would conduct fair trails for those individuals on both sides who have been responsible for gross human rights abuses. Because the continuing conflict in Burundi results in large part from mutual fear between the majority Hutu and the minority Tutsi, prosecutions are especially important as a way to eradicate impunity and end the cycles of violence that have plagued Burundi for so many years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington, DC - Statement by Bishop Daniel P. Reilly, Chairman, Committee on International Policy, United States Catholic Conference, in response to the crisis in the Great Lakes region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the start of the current cycle of violence in the Great Lakes region of Central Africa, political instability, war and violence have become endemic. The United States bishops are concerned that hundreds of thousands of men, women and children are being forced to live in sub-human social, economic, cultural and political conditions. We call on the international community to act quickly and decisively to assist in putting an end to the current violence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even the church is not immune from violence, as is evidenced by the large number of church officials that have fallen victim to violence in the region since 1993. It was with profound sadness that we learned of the tragic death of the most recent Church official to fall victim, Archbishop Christophe Munzihirwa Hwene Ngabo of Bukavu Zaire. 'The Catholic Bishops of the United States join with the suffering people in the Great Lakes Region in condemning this senseless act against a courageous defender of peace and spokesman against violence in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The maintenance, promotion and defense of human and political rights arc issues which concern all segments of a community, both nationally and internationally. Individuals community/grassroots groups and the Church all have a pivotal role to play in the protection of these rights. But, the greatest responsibility rests with the leadership of the region, who through their actions will determine the effectiveness of any future peace. We therefore implore the governments of Zaire, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi to avoid participation in violence and to discourage others from resort to force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We welcome the call from the leader of the rebel forces in eastern Zaire, Laurent Kabila, for a three-week unilateral cease-fire and the opening of talks in Rwanda by the Organization of African Unity, aimed at securing the safe passage of 1.1 million Rwandan refugees trapped in Zaire. We hope that these steps help to restore public trust, law and order, and that the regional leadership protect and guarantee the individual rights of all. Human rights are both the basis and the result of good government. There can be no peace in the Great Lakes region without respect for human rights, and human rights thrive best in the context of good governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We strongly urge the United States government to take the lead with the international community to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">bring all possible diplomatic pressures to bear on the governments of the region to end the violence and to restore order;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">urgently develop means to establish safe corridors and roads to facilitate the movement of people to safe areas;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">prepare for the airlift of food, shelter materials and other equipment, as needed, to avert mass starvation and disease among the refugee and local populations;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">reimpose the international arms embargo against Rwanda and impose an embargo against the other nations of the region that have used arms shipments to create regional instability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We believe that it is time for the leaders of the region to accept their responsibilities and begin the slow and painful process of social healing and reconciliation. Before this reconciliation can occur however, the governments of the region must have the capacity to address the numerous violations of human rights that have occurred so that reprisals may cease, and the tens of thousands of individuals languishing in prisons may have a fair hearing. As the Holy Father said in his statement to the Zairian church, &quot;We beg the Lord to touch human hearts so that the guns finally will be silenced and sentiments of hatred will disappear and give way to a search for peace and justice for all.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - The crisis in eastern Zaire confronts President Clinton with one of the gravest humanitarian emergencies in recent years. On the heels of his re-election, the President has a chance to galvanize the international community to save tens of thousands of civilian lives that will otherwise surely be lost in the days ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A million refugees are spreading across the Zaire countryside, having lost their UN lifeline to clean water and food. Already the weak are beginning to perish--infants, nursing mothers and the old.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deaths will almost certainly soon mount to the tens of thousands and will spiral higher than that, when cholera takes hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initial hope is gone that the cease-fire in eastern Rwanda might provide enough security for UN relief agencies and NGOs to open emergency assistance/repatriation corridors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is now clear that bringing in emergency aid to the refugees will require extraordinary actions by governments to immediately dispatch a security force to enable the resumption of life-sustaining aid and to repatriate those who wish to return to Rwanda. This will only happen with the direct involvement and leadership of the President, to build on the work already being done by senior Administration officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recommendations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The U.S. should take the lead in galvanizing the immediate deployment of an international force to provide life-sustaining emergency aid to the million lost refugees. The force need not be purely American, but it will require top-level American leadership to form and deploy. Quibbling about the modalities of such a force should end, and deployment of such a force must begin immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The President should give top priority to providing the best photos from satellite and other sources with complete transparency to enable the best emergency response from the UN and other relief agencies and to focus the international community on the need for urgent action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Clinton is faced with a major foreign policy issue which may well define his entire second term. The President has an opportunity to save tens of thousands of refugee civilians wandering the scrub of eastern Zaire. Only President Clinton can mobilize the international and U.S. resources necessary to address this crisis with the immediacy it requires.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - A caravan of an estimated 175,000 refugees who last week dispersed from Kahindo and Katale camps (total population 314,000) on the northern axis of Goma, fled westwards through lava fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A staff member of Medecins du Monde, trapped north of the Goma area until Wednesday, says that members of aid agencies joined the massive caravan carrying radios, but there has been no contact since the signal died last week. Medecins du Monde reported three or four different caravans of people who left the camps, but the smaller groups took different routes, avoiding the widest expanse of lava fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aid worker says that the refugees are dying on the lava fields, which emit dangerous gasses, have no water and no food. Other refugees avoided the widest expanse of lava and headed for bush and forest, and are reportedly heading for the Goma area. This aid worker and other eye witnesses also report a significant problem of internally displaced Zaireans. According to the trapped aid worker from Medecins du Monde, all small villages were completely empty on a 35 kilometer stretch of road between Rutshuru and Bunangana on the Ugandan border. There is &quot;a high state of tension&quot; reported between the Zairean displaced and the Rwandan Hutu refugees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees broke into food warehouses before leaving the Katale and Kahindo camps and took away what they were able to carry. All warehouses were emptied within four hours of Kahindo camp dispersing, including up to 3,000 tons of food from the largest WFP store in the area. Medecins du Monde report three or four different caravans of people who left the Katale and Kahindo camps.  He said &quot;we were amazed to see some of them climb up the mountains; we could see the camp fires at night&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aid worker ended up walking barefoot for 25 kilometres at the end of a terrifying odyssey in the conflict zone. He said competing armed groups of Zairean soldiers of various divisions, Interahamwe and refugees totally looted camps and villages; he was twice threatened with execution by a group of former Rwandan soldiers. The Zairean Camp Security Contingent - Zairean soldiers paid by UNHCR to guard the camps and relief operations - also fled.  Some were reported killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another eye-witness from ACT (Action for Churches Together) reports from a aerial survey this week that there is a high concentration of people in the jungle area between Hombo and Walikale, who have been surviving in the jungle for about three weeks and are described as being in &quot;very bad condition&quot;. The mass consists of both refugees and internally displaced people, who are in &quot;a state of high tension, robbing each other&quot;. ACT also reports empty villages, empty schools, empty markets and no work going on the fields. On a 200 kilometer stretch of road from Lubutu, only one car was seen, and all villages appeared empty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fleeing Zairean soldiers are retreating and looting their way towards Kisangani. Some reports say soldiers arriving in Kisangani are fighting with Zairean soldiers stationed in Kisangani. All aircraft in Kisangani have reportedly been flown out, leaving concentrated numbers of soldiers with no easy escape route. Flight observations say there are no visible concentration of refugees in the Masisi area, as previously speculated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The press have reported the recommendation of military intervention in a draft resolution presented to the Security Council, including the option of &quot; Chapter VII&quot; which allows for intervention without assent from the parties in conflict. Military intervention aims to establish protected zones and ensure the safe delivery of aid. The resolution recommends that a mission be limited to a period of two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement issued by the Special Meeting of European Union Development and Humanitarian Aid Ministers in Brussels yesterday (November 7 Thursday) expressed full support for the United Nations, regional leaders and the Organisation of African Unity to facilitate a resolution to the conflict, and underlined support for the regional heads of state Summit held in Nairobi on Tuesday November 5. The draft resolution given to the Security Council yesterday, prepared by France and also discussed by the Brussels meeting on Thursday, contains the proposals made by France and expresses deep concern at the humanitarian situation and the need to act quickly. Some countries - like Britian - reportedly emphasised the need for further consultations with Zaire, and stressed the needs of refugees and internally displaced people rather than focusing on military intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Security Council is expected to meet on the matter in the next two days.  Despite the scale of the emergency, some countries show reservations about military intervention because of past experiences, like Somalia, which drew much international criticism and ultimately failed, in the long term, to resolve conflict and meet humanitarian needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British-based charity Save the Children Fund issued a statement on Thursday evening opposing military intervention. The SCF statement said military intervention would take too long and &quot;may well compound the problems in the region&quot;. SCF said the priority was to restore stability in order to provide support for those in need of humanitarian assistance, and help with &quot;major and rapid voluntary repatriation&quot;. Oxfam International yesterday called on the UN Security Council to endorse deployment of a force. Refugees International urged US President Clinton to &quot;take a lead in galvanising the immediate deployment of an international force to provide life-sustaining emergency aid to the million lost refugees&quot; in a statement issued yesterday.  It also said the US should urgently provide &quot;the best photos from satellite and other sources with complete transparency to enable the best emergency response&quot;. UNHCR and other agencies have asked donors to supply satellite images to track the whereabouts of the refugees, but no hard data has yet emerged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special Mediator for UN, Ambassador Raymond Chretien, UN Humanitarian Coordinator for the Great Lakes Sergio de Mello and Assistant Coordinator Martin Griffiths are meeting today in Kigali, Rwanda. They are expected to discuss Chretien's talks with President Mobutu in Nice, who had requested Chretien to proceed to Kigali rather than Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - So who is making the most money on the Internet? Computer companies? Bookshops? Music vendors? Maybe, if your criteria is volume of sales. But if you're looking at return on investment, there is another industry smiling all the way to the cyberbank. In terms of ongoing investment in resources, web design outfits - often one man and a scanner - are the big early winners in web commerce.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the industry matures, many of the one- person operations and fly-by- nights will disappear, and quality outfits will rise above the throng. Only those design companies that consistently deliver quality web sites to corporate clients will be taken seriously, while numerous smaller operations that are able to bring in effective sites on small budgets will find themselves in fierce competition for business as well as profile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa has a number of web design operations that produce sites on a par with the best in the world. Those working at the cutting edge include hot designers at these cool sites:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* VWV Interactive (http://www.vwv.co.za/) is the undisputed market leader of the moment, following its triumph in the Cool Site of the Day awards for the Nando's ChickenWired site. Its Athletics South Africa site is an example of clever graphic design, while its South African Airways (SAA) site boasts good design even if it doesn't work for the user - that is SAA's fault - owing to the lack of interaction from the site owner, but also a classic South African example of a megabuck site that may win awards but serves little purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Of current players, Electric Ocean (http://www.electric.co.za/) is probably the main rival to VWV in the quality of design and technology. Aside from a way cool home page, check out its very slick, attractive and interactive Leisureplan travel search engine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Blades Media (http://kenya.icafe.co.za/blades/) also has a very cool (literally and figuratively) welcome page, and produces brilliant if incomprehensible sites for the likes of Benneton Fear-0-@Fabrica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* WebSenCe (http://www.websence co.za) boasts one of the coolest opening page graphics of any web designer anywhere, and brings its design suss to corporate sites like the classy Paarl Wine Route page and an unexpectedly cool page for Prestasi insurance brokers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Cyberway (http://cy.co.za/) is a small operation that has put together the local Global One page, an unusually cool corporate site that does not depend on gimmickry, as well as the acclaimed Botswana Focus site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Stones Internet (http://stones.co.za/) sites may not be at the cutting edge of design, but its Unit Trusts SA and Stones Interactive Restaurant Guide sites are beautiful examples of effective interactive sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The same applies to Neptune Web Services (www.neptune.co.za/ web.htm), which shows a quality approach to web databases with its Braby's on the web site.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Most readers who take umbrage against an article which appears in a newspaper will write one letter to the editor and leave it at that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But an unusual row has developed at Rapport between its editor, Izak de Villiers, and its former deputy editor, Professor Hein (HJ) Grosskopf.  Grosskopf has written a spate of letters to the editor, the manager, the managing director, the editorial staff and members of the board in protest against an article which appeared in Rapport on October 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The article suggested that Grosskopf's son Hein (an African National Congress activist who has an Afrikaner right-wing reward of R50 000 placed on his head) was in hiding at a secret address in England.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This lead story of Hein junior &quot;confirmed&quot; he was in hiding by stating that his address and telephone number did not appear in any of the British telephone directories. For his father, this article was one of the worst written about his son, and his vitriolic letters demanded De Villiers's resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first letter (in Afrikaans) was sent to Rapport's general manager, Fanie Jordaan, and began: &quot;Are you also nauseated by Izak's hypocrisy?&quot; According to Grosskopf, De Villiers's hypocrisy was clearly evident in his latest footnote which responded to a reader's letter of complaint at De Villiers's renewed attempts to sensationalise his campaign against Hein junior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His defence was that the misleading, trashy article was based on the fact that Hein did not make his address generally known - while the pitiful Izak himself hides behind a secret address and secret telephone number!&quot; writes Grosskopf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second letter, also addressed to Jordaan, called on De Villiers to resign and sarcastically suggests that he is the man Afrikaners have been waiting for to rescue their culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grosskopf writes that the need is so great among Afrikaners that they urgently want Rapport's management to pension off De Villiers so that he can begin this task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just think of the wonderful cultural leadership he had already provided, like the loan of R100 000 to the Wit Wolf so that he could tell his old story again why he killed so many kaffirs. And the breathless way he tells us exclusively that a third-rate actor has for the umpteenth time made an unmarried girl pregnant. That's culture!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grosskopf's next letter was addressed to the news editor and written as a news article. He suggests that it be used in the next edition with the headline &quot;Exclusive: Rapport's Izak located! The truth about his new face!  His luxury hideout exposed!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;article&quot; says De Villiers's fan club, mesmerised by his colourful use of language, looked in vain for his telephone number in the Rand directory.  His &quot;lackeys&quot; refusing to give them his address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It continues with details of De Villiers's cosmetic surgery to change his appearance in preparation for his new role as leader of the Afrikaners and his cruise around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Attempts to get comment from him failed constantly because his home and movements remain a secret,&quot; writes Grosskopf. &quot;It is naturally his right to keep his home a secret, but it creates opportunities for elements to gossip that there are shady reasons for this unusual situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his next letter to De Villiers, Grosskopf says he has written so lightheartedly because he wants to show De Villiers how he is making a fool of himself with his &quot;hoernalistiek&quot; about his son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will surprise you how many journalists phoned us to say this was the most synthetic sensationalism they have ever encountered.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now it has gotten serious, and this fax has only one aim: to persuade you to take the honourable route in the interests of Rapport.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grosskopf's next fax is addressed to the editorial staff of Rapport, after De Villiers failed to persuade him to stop his flow of letters. He says the &quot; smear article&quot; about his son was not whispered confidentially but &quot;blurted out&quot; to all the newspaper's readers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You did not answer my charge of hypocrisy: that you are hiding away at a secret address which is not generally advertised,&quot; writes Grosskopf. &quot;It is great that you are no longer going to place articles which have as its source a nameless gossiper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, I accept your apology for the pain your articles have caused myself and my wife. It is strange that a former priest's (De Villiers) sensitivity for how a father feels if his wife and child is defamed, can only develop when his own wife and children land up in the crossfire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last letter in the Mail &amp; Guardian's possession dated October 31 and ended with &quot;continues&quot;, is even more vitriolic than the previous ones.  Grosskopf's olive branch is withdrawn and he quotes Oliver Cromwell who told Parliament, &quot;Depart, I say, and let us have done with you. In the name of God, go!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His blood pressure seemingly rose again when he discovered the tactics Rapport had used to get its story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How do you feel about the fact that your agent is harassing a 78-year-old widow. That's not how your mother raised you. I believe you condemn this, but still, you remain the editor of a paper where such things happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grosskopf complains bitterly about the fact that a Rapport &quot;agent&quot; had camped for three days on a London pavement to get photographs of his five- year-old granddaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's obscene, and it's all happening while you are safely hiding away in your secret shelter. Can I tell you how your brave warriors found my son? &quot; His mother-in-law, a 78-year-old retired lecturer, was constantly pestered at her home by one of your agents, who also harassed her neighbours. &quot;If your hero, Adriaan Vlok, who ordered Khotso House's bombing, says Hein did this, that, or the other, the chase is then on for his mother-in-law and daughter.  Can you answer these questions, Izak?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I really think you should do the honourable thing for Nasionale Pers (Naspers) and resign, because you are becoming a burden to everyone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grosskopf refused to comment on the row, except to say he was &quot;very disappointed&quot; that Rapport had decided to do the story about his son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naspers chairman Ton Vosloo also said he had no comment on the &quot; confidential correspondence&quot;. De Villiers said the matter had been settled and, as a father, he would never attack another father by using his son. &quot;I don't understand why people are wanting me to retire. I myself wanted to do so last year already and was persuaded by the board to remain for another year. I am definitely going into retirement next year,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Eight new radio stations and a new television channel are some of the changes taking place in South Africa's media industry, writes IBA councillor John Matisonn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AROUND September next year, South Africa will have a newly licenced national television channel that will compete head-to-head with the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) for viewers and will be available without decoders, subscription or licence fees to most South Africans with television sets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between now and then - starting at hearings in Cape Town on November 12 for private radio stations - the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) will licence eight new private radio stations, besides the six that were privatised in September, starting with three in Cape Town, one in Durban and four in Gauteng.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the IBA is preparing for the next round of private radio licences, in the secondary markets, for the early part of next year. Anyone who wants the IBA to consider licencing a private radio station in areas outside of Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban, should get an &quot;Expression of Interest Form&quot; and fill it in by December 1.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on these expressions of interest, the IBA will publish a list of towns where the next round of radio licence hearings will be held. These could include Port Elizabeth, East London, Pretoria, Pietersburg, Bloemfontein and Pietermaritzburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This process costs you nothing and commits you to nothing. Neither does it commit the IBA. But it does give the IBA a base to determine where the next most urgent cases are for the next round of licencing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cost structure of radio allows for lighter regulation of programming because the listener will have considerable choice across the stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the interim, the IBA is ready to hold hearings to determine a new Capital Radio owner as soon as it receives applications. (It is understood that the IBA can licence Capital Radio despite reports that it will be closed down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulator is believed to be ready and willing to issue a licence to a successful applicant, but it depends on whether Capital Radio's owner, the Ministry of Telecommunications, decides if it is going to sell off the radio station's assets and consider the potential offers from interested parties.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So there will be much happening in broadcasting during the next 12 months.  Hot competition for the new television licence is expected to come from a number of consortia including strong local and/or overseas television experts, local business and black empowerment groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simply to prepare these applications will cost several millions of rands - 20-million to 30-million may not be unusual. The losers may get nothing, and the winners will get the right to run a large, potentially lucrative business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does that sound strange or unfair? Then welcome to the world of global communication. This is the system that was adopted in the United Kingdom, and many other countries with their first commercial or private licences, in order to ensure competition around quality instead of just price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As broadcasting markets have matured, they have moved more and more to auctioning off licences to the highest bidder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, to aid the early stages of developing a private broadcasting industry, South Africa, at the World Trade Centre where the IBA Act was written, chose not to go that route as it is committed to ensuring diversity in the broadcasting arena.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IBA had to make a choice which involved a trade-off - lots of little stations would only be viable covering a small area of the country and using mostly cheap programming. On the other hand, planning for a strong national coverage by a licence makes it possible to insist on substantial local programming that will express our culture and develop our programming industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viewers stand to benefit from the new television station as it will compete directly with SABC channels for audiences by providing a strong mix of news and current affairs during prime time, as well as local and overseas drama series, sitcoms and soaps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's some of the thinking so far. Now it's over to the public. The IBA has published the terms of the proposed licence. Comments must be in by February 28 1997. That will be followed by public hearings in March next year where people are invited to make their case. A final document will then be drafted and licence applications will close in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IBA drafted its plan for the new television station after extensive international comparative research - especially to determine how much South African-made news and drama the South African television advertising market can afford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Private TV Discussion Document is based on the assumption - accepted by financial experts - that the new station will not only draw an existing revenue now going to SABC stations, but also on new advertising revenue that will expand the television advertising cake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To ensure a fair competitive environment, the IBA will investigate M-Net's licence conditions, taking into account the SABC's obligations as well. That inquiry will look at M-Net's continued use of the two-hour window of open time, and the fact that M-Net is currently broadcasting on two channels in many of South Africa's towns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will also compare M-Net's advertising rules with subscription channels in other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IBA intends to settle the future terms for M-Net next year, so that the potential owners of the new channel know what the playing field will look like before they get on to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local content and programming regulations used by IBA counterparts in other Commonwealth countries, including Canada, Australia and Britain, were taken into account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rules for the new television station are different from the new private radio stations which the IBA has begun to licence. Television is limited by its costs and the number of frequencies available, so the new channel must cater to a wide range of tastes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has appointed a well-paid, full-time lobbyist at Parliament to protect its interests during negotiations on the parastatal's financial independence, among other things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tango Lamani, who has had two years work experience as a media liaison for the Constitutional Assembly, took up the post of SABC Parliamentary Liaison in July to monitor the legislative process and lobby parliamentarians on behalf of the SABC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The pace of development in Parliament is such that if you don't have a person close to the process, you can lose out on a great deal,&quot; said SABC's group manager of communications and marketing, Enoch Sithole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are a number of Bills to be passed which will affect the industry and it is important we monitor these developments closely.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sithole dismissed criticism by SABC's political staffers that Lamani's appointment could compromise the editorial independence of SABC news as well as interfere with news coverage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He argued that Lamani's job was a necessity as it would be ludicrous to use SABC reporters to do the work Lamani was doing, such as setting up meetings with politicians and liaising on legislation and appointment of the board members with the portfolio committee of communications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sithole said that the dates set for parliamentary hearings on legislation were often changed at the drop of a hat and the relevant people in the SABC head office in Johannesburg would hear of this too late, adding that Lamani's role was therefore vital in keeping up-to-date with happenings in and around Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lamani says his position is an inherited one as he follows on the heels of Pieter Cronje, the previous SABC parliamentary liaison who quit his job in 1992. However, the revival of the post after four years says much about the current vulnerability of the SABC, as well as a great deal about the accessibility of the parliamentary process to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lamani was appointed by Sithole after working for him at the Constitutional Assembly. (Sithole's department, with about 40 staff members, cost the SABC this year R24-million. However, he said this week that it was unlikely he would be allocated as much money again. Half his budget is spent on marketing and publicity projects, the other half on running costs, travelling expenses and salaries.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lamani, under Sithole's direction, is focusing particularly on negotiations relating to the financing of the public broadcaster by the government, and the manner in which it will be done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, the task team on government communications (Comtask) has, according to Lamani, proposed the setting up of a forum of all stakeholders which would meet twice a year to allocate money to SABC projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sithole is critical of such a model, saying he would prefer a BBC-style relationship with the government, where a pact is made with the nation and funds are provided by the government to fulfil the obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a few problems with the Comtask recommendation. If committees of stakeholders discuss budgetary issues, the discussion must be confined strictly to the budget. If this committee started to approve projects, we would feel nervous that the government could be interfering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The SABC will propose that we sign a pact with the government which would set out the SABC' s obligation to the nation. Then the government would fund us on the basis that we fulfil our mandate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lamani said he would also be focusing on the passage of legislation governing the public broadcaster, which will be debated next year, on the selection of the new SABC board which is currently under way, and the dispute between SABC and the IBA over rights to televise sporting events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l The SABC is to change its financial calender to suit the government's because of its future dependency on state coffers. Enoch Sithole said the corporation knew the government would give them money at the next budget allocation, but they still did not know how much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the SABC was preparing a budget for R2,1-billion for the next financial year and at a rough estimate, the SABC could probably provide about R1,5-billion of that on its own, leaving a shortfall of about R0,6- billion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government will decide what they want to pay for. For example, they might pay for all provincial broadcasting and all local content broadcasts.  We will have to see in March,&quot; he said. The money from the sale of the SABC six regional radio stations is also still in the government's hands and the SABC has to apply for the money, Sithole said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Rembrandt International group's tobacco arm, R&amp;R Tobacco has decided to pull more than one-million-rand's worth of advertising from The Star newspaper following an editorial written by editor Peter Sullivan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng Newspapers managing director Deon du Plessis said one of the reasons given by the tobacco company was that it &quot;did not want to embarrass the editor of The Star&quot; following his editorial which appeared two weeks ago on October 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The editorial, which was clearly anti-smoking, stated that the Minister of Health, Nkosazana Zuma, should be supported in her stand against tobacco companies who &quot;disregard the current advertising regulations&quot;. The editorial entitled &quot;Hard line on smoke ads&quot; was based largely on a report emanating from Harvard University in the United States and used information from the report to back-up an argument against tobacco advertisers who were flouting the rules.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the report's findings was that in 25 years time smoking will be the single biggest cause of death and disability worldwide. The editorial ended with the following: &quot;In the light of this, Zuma's threat of an outright ban is justified, especially against those companies which she claims are flouting the rules. Zuma's responsibility is to ensure our finite health budget is not squandered on cancer or respiratory and cardiovascular ailments which could be reduced simply by discouraging people from smoking&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, this week, Sullivan said he &quot;would be delighted'' to have Rembrandt's advertising and &quot;will not at all be embarrassed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe absolutely in the right of the newspaper to say what it wishes about smoking or any other matter without interference by the advertiser,&quot; he said adding that he also &quot;believes in the advertiser's right to advertise wherever they choose&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rembrandt Group Limited international company secretary, Jan Engelbrecht, said he was unaware of any tobacco withdrawals, but was not in a position to confirm or deny the allegations against the R&amp;R Tobacco group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite repeated efforts, R&amp;R Tobacco press officer Hans Knoetze did not respond to any of the Mail &amp; Guardian's queries other than to say that &quot; because of the sensitivities regarding this issue&quot; the company was unable to make any comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;R&amp;R Tobacco and The Star have exchanged views and there are mutual understanding and respect for each other's viewpoint,'' he said. But an insider at the group confirmed that the advertising has been pulled from The Star in direct response to Sullivan's editorial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sullivan added that it was &quot;very good news that the advertising slots vacated by the group had immediately been picked up by other clients who were extremely happy to have the prime positions on the front page&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President of the South African Chapter of the International Advertising Association, Bryan Butler, said he was surprised at Sullivan's editorial and &quot; equally surprised that tobacco advertising was withdrawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If this situation has drawn attention to how people play with words and exercise their freedom of expression, then maybe it has served a good purpose, &quot; he said, adding that it is &quot;strange that an editor who jealously guards a newspaper's and journalists' freedom of expression should be quite happy to recommend that someone else, in this case the tobacco companies, lose theirs''.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Transnet has fired executive director Sipho Nyawo following an independent investigation into credit card abuse. The parastatal briefed Minister of Public Enterprises Stella Sigcau on Wednesday and had the decision ratified by Cabinet that night. His dismissal is effective immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyawo, who joined the board in July 1996 to head Portnet, was suspended last week as the investigation by retired judge John Trengrove drew to a close. A ministry representative says the investigation found Nyawo guilty of 15 of the 56 charges against him.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A previous internal investigation had drawn up 181 cases where Nyawo's use of his company credit card was suspect. These included fast food take-outs, medical bills for another party and first-class plane tickets. The cash involved was more than R100 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transnet said earlier this week that it had uncovered 121 cases of credit abuse among other management. The alleged offenders would appear before a disciplinary panels by the end of this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyawo's dismissal represents a major foul-up by Transnet and the ministry.  He was given the Portnet position even though the findings of the internal investigation were known. Appointments to the Transnet board are made on Sigcau's recommendation, and ratified by the Cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transnet has tried and failed to keep the credit card scandal in check. It was pushed into acting only after allegations about Nyawo were leaked to the press by other Transnet staff earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much of the bad blood stems from Transnet's embrace of affirmative action - a policy which has led to an exodus of top white management, and dark mutterings from white unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main criticism is that Transnet's only criterion for recruiting to top positions is skin colour. Six new black executives have joined the Transnet executive board in the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, professional recruitment agencies canvassed by the Mail &amp; Guardian this week gave a unanimous thumbs-up for the new board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They surveyed the curricula vitae of four of the new directors - Saki Macozoma, Gloria Serobe, Joe Ndhlela and Zukile Nomvete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agencies were asked to compare the directors' experience with the requirements they would want if they were looking to fill the Transnet positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only weak link was seen to be Macozoma, whose experience is more as a politician than a businessman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agencies, by nature secretive organisations, declined in most cases to be named. One, however, was quite willing to stand up behind the new Transnet board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With Serobe in particular I was very impressed,&quot; says Alistair Hubbard of an independent Johannesburg agency Hubbard &amp; Associates. &quot;She is very marketable with a good professional and financial background.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One agency owner says he would be &quot;more than happy&quot; to take Serobe and Ndhlela on to his books. &quot;Their experience means I could easily place them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another agency says it is unable to detect what Macozoma actually does for Transnet. &quot;He's got an excellent academic background and he's obviously a good politician,&quot; one headhunter says. &quot;But I can't see his portfolio, because he has no functional background.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transnet was unable to provide a curriculum vitae for Nyawo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAKI MACOZOMA - managing director</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 39-year old MP was appointed to his current position in September. His main business experience stems from a stint as business development manager at South African Breweries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Macozoma was involved in organising the South African students' movement in the mid- Seventies. He spent six years on Robben Island and on his release became a prominent member of the United Democratic Front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is a member of the African National Congress's National Executive, and chairman of the parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Communications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within Transnet he is responsible for marketing policy and strategy.  Macozoma also acts as the parliamentary liaison for the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agency verdict: Experienced politician but weak business background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GLORIA TOMATOE SEROBE - executive director</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Serobe joined the executive in May, taking responsibility for financial policy and strategy, the pension fund and information technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is also executive director of Women Investment Portfolio, which she helped found, and director of the Airports Company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armed with a BComm and Masters in Business Administration from Rutgers University in the United States, Serobe worked at Exxon Corporation, Premier Group and Munich Reinsurance Company. She joined Transnet after four years at Standard Corporate and Merchant Bank, where she gained experience in areas such as mergers and acquisitions and privatisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agency verdict: An asset - probably the pick of the bunch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOE NDHLELA - executive director</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appointed in April, 41-year old Ndhlela's responsibilities include human resources, training and development, organisational transformation, alongside business divisions PX and Petronet. He also led the initial investigation into the Sipho Nyawo allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndhlela joined Transnet in 1989 as labour relations manager and made it to the board as non-executive director in November 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previous experience includes working for Josiah Parkes, MSD and South African Breweries. He is also managing director of Sentrachem's Mega Hitec company. Ndhlela is a member of the Black Management Forum and the Institute of Personnel Management. Agency verdict: Excellent credentials, particularly personnel experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZUKILE NOMVETE - executive director</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responsible for South African Airways (with total operating assets of R5,1- billion) and Transnet's property business, which includes the Point Waterfront in Durban and Cape Town's Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront. The 38- year-old was appointed in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also currently executive manager at Metrorail, Nomvete's experience includes a marketing directorship at Denel, and marketing with Thebe Investment. He sits on the board of Sun Air and the Airports Company, and did a course at Wits School of Business Administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nomvete has extensive experience in aviation, obtaining qualifications in Ethiopia and Ireland and flying 3 300 hours as a flight engineer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agency verdict: Sound mix of technical and marketing skills.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Linking up with Malaysian group Petronas and listing exploration arm Energy Africa have speeded up Engen's drive into Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief executive Rob Angel told a recent media briefing that Petronas's 30% stake in Engen gave the South African company the financial muscle at a time of squeezed margins to venture into downstream operations in Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Engen has invested R100-million in a state- of-the-art oil terminal in Dar es Salaam as well as several inland depots which will &quot;open up the whole hinterland&quot;. It also has the option on two service station networks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Engen has been keen to get into Africa for some time and has been &quot;putting volumes into Africa since 1990, but now for the first time there is a substantial evidence of serious investment going in there&quot;, Angel says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Energy Africa, meanwhile, has been successful in the N'kossa and Alba oil fields in the Congo, and wells have been drilled in the Moho field. In Angola's Block Two, oil has been discovered and another field is being tested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a number of other areas in Angola that we are looking at,&quot; Angel says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Namibia, a well was spudded some time ago in the Kudu gas field and tests are under way with high hopes that it will be commercial. Energy Africa owns 10% of the Kudu field with Shell Exploration and Production Namibia owning the balance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also involved in Soekor's Oribi oil field off Mossel Bay, which is expected to start production in early 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angel says that, overall, Energy Africa &quot;has acreage in the right areas&quot; where world oil industry players are increasingly focusing their attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are also a partner of choice ... because we are African,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite these successes, Angel believes Energy Africa's share price is undervalued &quot;because it is not understood&quot; despite the fact that it is a straight rand hedge share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company has &quot;just blossomed&quot; over the last few years. Many major oil companies are streaming into Africa, but &quot;relative to our size we are at least up there with them if not a bit ahead&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Energy Africa is currently looking at possibilities in Algeria &quot;that would have taken longer without the Petronas connection&quot;. The company is also &quot; sniffing&quot; around Libya, Angel says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The introduction of continuous operations at Johannesburg Consolidated Investment's HJ Joel gold mine played a major part in pulling the Free State operation back from the brink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human resources director Andre Geldenhuys says Fulco has led to a 20% jump in employees on core operations - an additional 400 jobs - improved productivity and higher output.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 7% fall in unit costs is directly linked to Fulco, Geldenhuys says. The workers' reward is a 15% premium on their wages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assumption that Fulco means more work is wrong, he adds. &quot;The mines work continuously, the people do not.&quot; Workers have fewer, though longer, consecutive shifts because the staff complement has grown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The life of the mine can be extended, depending on the physical structure and capacity of the mine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joel is a relatively new operation, but has struggled since it started to make a profit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its shareholders have been called on several times to bail the operation out. Its latest recapitalisation has been sold on the basis that the mine has a revised development plan, far greater working efficiency, and that it will sell forward years of its output to ensure a revenue stream while it develops new ore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mine reported its second consecutive profitable quarter in the three months to September, as costs fell to R36,805/kg from R40,807/kg in the three months to June. It wants to cut costs to around R30,000/kg by next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geldenhuys says Fulco's use should not be limited to marginal mines. He too believes management and labour should hold a summit to revisit what Fulco should be all about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole concept needs a mind-set change. It shouldn't only be used when a mine is in trouble. It should be done much sooner.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Continuous mining operations, long mooted as a lifeline for the mining industry, have proved less successful than hoped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The principle that mines would move to seven-day operations - or full calendar operations (Fulco) - was finally agreed between management and unions last year, after years of negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Management had argued that fulco would lift output (a 25% jump was one figure bandied about), extend the life of mines, and narrow the gap between local mining costs and the far lower costs of mines abroad.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other observers were more sceptical. Such scepticism, at least for now, seems to have been vindicated. The take up by the mining industry has been limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far this year the government mining engineer has granted 15 mines exemptions under the Mine and Works Act to work on Sundays. Last year there were 20 approvals. &quot;These have been fewer than expected,&quot; one official says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those that have taken the plunge include shafts at Anglo American's Vaal Reefs and Freegold gold operations, Anglovaal's Loraine and Hartebeesfontein mines, Gold Fields of South Africa's Black Mountain and O'Okiep base metal mines, copper mine Palabora and Johannesburg Consolidated Investment's (JCI) resurgent gold mine HJ Joel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JCI is leading the push toward Fulco, also tabling the system at its Western Areas mine. Others are more cautious. Anglo introduced a new shift system at its Freegold mine earlier this year, after warning that 10 000 job were on the line. Most were saved, but much of the credit went to the rand's fall which lifted the gains from the dollar gold price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's definitely a tool to help us cope,&quot; representative James Duncan says.  &quot;It's not been a blanket success, but we never considered it a panacea for the industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gengold says it hasn't thrown Fulco out of the window, but it has no plans to introduce it (though the government mining engineer lists Gengold's developing mine Oryx as an applicant for Sunday working).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's just not delivering the output,&quot; says Peter Lewis, researcher for Industrial Health Research Group at University of Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many mine managers he has surveyed are returning to voluntary overtime work as an option over Fulco. Others are employing new management strategies to investigate lost productivity, such as tracking lost blasts (shifts worked with no blasting recorded).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many cases, workers have simply not climbed aboard the Fulco bus, often failing to arrive to work the additional shifts the system creates. &quot;The premiums are just not high enough to warrant the long hours,&quot; Lewis says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Union of Mineworkers secretary general Kgalema Motlanthe says the union wants a summit of all industry representatives to discuss the implications of Sunday working. &quot;It raises social questions; everything from church to soccer happens on Sunday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Lewis says fulco merely forms part of a fundamental change in working patterns. The industry is also making greater use of casual labour, and bonus payments - a major incentive to the workforce to work harder - are now common across the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Privately within the industry, and publicly for its analysts, the other argument has been that Fulco can never achieve its potential unless management is prepared to look at where it's gone wrong in labour relations.  This is clearly a more difficult demand than merely applying to the government mining engineer to blast on a Sunday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - First National Bank (FNB) has given ousted managing director Barry Swart a pay-off barely different to the salary he would have earned had he not been fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank, which released its year-end results this week, is refusing to disclose terms of the settlement which were agreed to in September when Swart left FNB amid allegations of nepotism.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But insiders say the package roughly equals what he would have received for the remaining three years of his contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank has also decided against disclosing the details of Swart's pay-off to shareholders, arguing that the terms of his &quot;early retirement&quot; should remain confidential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FNB's 1995 annual report shows the board's total remuneration stood at R2,4- million last year, with services as directors accounting for R800 000. As the bank's only executive director for that year, Swart's salary accounted for the lion's share. He is also thought to have close to a million FNB share options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swart was ousted after an internal investigation found he had handed his daughter's firm the contract to decorate FNB's Bank City headquarters in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigation began last November, and the FNB board censured Swart in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The censure was leaked to the media, damaging FNB's credibility. The board also discovered Swart had continued to give work to his daughter, despite its warning.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The series of transactions that have massively boosted black ownership of pay TV channel M-Net will inevitably prompt more black representation on its board, says chief executive Gerrie de Villiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M-Net will soon represent one of the largest black empowerment transactions to date.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revolution in the company, which started life as a white commercial channel, will be effected by the acquisition of controlling stakes in two key shareholders - Johnnic and Perskor by the National Empowerment Consortium (NEC) and Kagiso Trust Investments respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Johnnic deal will give the NEC control of Omni Media, which owns 24% of M-Net, with the Perskor/Kagiso holding amounting to 8%. Another 10% of M-Net already lies in black hands following the Phutuma share offer. This leaves the total effective black shareholding at 42%. Nasionale Pers has 19%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Independent Broadcasting Authority's rules, 15% is deemed to amount to control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Villiers says there will obviously be an increase in black board members, which already has two members and one alternate director from &quot;previously disadvantaged groups&quot;. On programming, he says he expects the new board members will take decisions that &quot;are right from the business point of view&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Anglo American Corporation is lifting its stake in Johannesburg Consolidated Investment's (JCI) gold mine Western Areas - a move which could ensure it remains the mine's largest shareholder after JCI's planned sale to black business. The corporation is refusing to comment on what it terms &quot;speculation&quot;, but market sources say Anglo has been snapping up stock in Western Areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anglo's 1996 annual report shows the corporation, together with investment arm Amgold, directly owns 15,2% of Western Areas. Anglo's 39,6% stake in JCI gives it, indirectly, another 13% of the mine.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western Areas is widely viewed as JCI's prize asset. It was the main profit producer for JCI's gold stable in the year to June, earning R216,3-million before capital expenditure. Western Areas' merger last year with the South Deep exploration project also created one of the world's largest mineable orebodies. &quot;It's the plum,&quot; one mining executive says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts say Anglo's decision to lift its stake may stem from Amgold's decision to switch its interest into bigger mines with a longer life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They add, however, that such activity will also affect the black empowerment plans for JCI. &quot;Anglo obviously wants to keep a meaningful stake,&quot; one says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anglo and associate De Beers own 47% of JCI. Two groups - Nthato Motlana's New Africa Investments Limited (Nail) and Mzi Khumalo's Capital Alliance - have emerged as front- runners to buy it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The race has accelerated following the conclusion last month of Anglo's sale of 35% of industrial group Johnnic to the National Empowerment Consortium, led by Nail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the sharp rise in JCI's share price - it has more than doubled in the past 17 months to R48 - has prompted fears on the JCI board that the black empowerment efforts could be stymied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Real Africa Investments, once the front- runner, has already dropped out of the race, claiming the price tag is now too high. The deal is expected to cover 35% of JCI - currently worth R2,3-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nail deputy executive chairman Cyril Ramaphosa was in London this week attempting to finalise finance, apparently with United States bank Merrill Lynch. Capital Alliance is thought to have already secured the backing it needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The general consensus is that Anglo will not be prepared to offer a substantial discount on JCI's share price - 5% is likely to be maximum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representative Michael Spicer says Nail and Capital Alliance made their initial pitches for JCI last Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says Anglo will not favour any proposal which includes stripping JCI of its assets. Its operations also include Consolidated Metallurgical Industries, Tavistock Colliery and a fledgling, but thriving African gold exploration business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts say JCI prefers Nail because of the political capital Ramaphosa can offer as JCI goes north of the Limpopo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JCI representative Marc Gonsalves says the group is already deriving benefits in Africa from speculation that Ramaphosa might be the next chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But concerns have been raised about Ramaphosa's ability to divide his attention between JCI and Johnnic, where he is already chairman. The prospect of Anglo allowing one group to dominate the JCI and Johnnic black empowerment deals is also in question. Many believe a partnership between Nail and Capital Alliance is likely.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Compared to last week's freefall, the rand enjoyed something approaching a settled week. The currency's downfall, while uppermost in the minds of the public, is one of several fundamental concerns over the economy.  Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals spent some time this week outlining his thoughts on these issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How has the rand's fall influenced the inflation rate and interest rates?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rand's fall had an immediate direct effect on the prices of imported goods, as reflected by their month-to-month changes of between 0,8 and 1,8 percentage points in the three months April to June 1996. This probably also contributed indirectly to the rise in the prices of domestically produced goods since April 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the effect of the depreciation on imported goods' prices was absorbed by foreign exporters as well as domestic producers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further increases in inflation should therefore still take place. This pressure has increased with the latest sharp depreciation of the rand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This clearly demands a restrictive monetary policy and was an important reason for the increase in bank rate to very high real levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Future monetary policy will depend on developments in domestic economic conditions, such as the growth in domestic expenditure, money supply and bank credit extension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where will the rand settle?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any person willing to predict the level at which the rand will stabilise under present circumstances would be very brave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When does the bank plan further relaxation of exchange controls and what form will it take?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister of finance is responsible for changes to the exchange control.  The bank can only advise the minister, but he takes the final decision. The government has indicated it intends to gradually reduce exchange controls as part of its macro- economic strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Considerable progress has already been made in removing exchange controls.  Non-residents are free to move funds in or out of the country. Current transactions are not subject to control, though qualitative limits are applied in a few cases to avoid a circumvention of the rulings applicable on capital transfers of residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Controls remain on outward capital investments of residents and the transfer of the capital assets of emigrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More lenient policies are followed in allowing direct investments abroad and concessions have been made on portfolio investments of domestic institutional investors in other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further steps would include more lenient rules on the foreign investments of institutional investors, which will broaden out to the relaxation of controls on the capital transfers of individuals. The free transfer of the capital assets of emigrants will probably only be implemented in the final stages of the abolition of exchange control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are you happy with the broad direction of the government's fiscal and macro- economic policy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank supports the government's macro- economic strategy for Growth, Employment and Redistribution (Gear) and believes the package of measures proposed should lead to higher sustainable economic growth, employment creation and greater financial stability, and create opportunities for a more equitable distribution of income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This plan also provides for structural adjustments in all the major macro- economic areas, which should alleviate the pressures on monetary policy to achieve and maintain price stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What role could or should the International Monetary Fund (IMF) play in policy formation?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A stand-by facility from the IMF will help in increasing the foreign reserves to a somewhat higher level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In furnishing this financial aid, the fund also normally requires a country to fulfil certain conditions which could require even greater monetary and fiscal discipline and could increase the confidence of non- resident investors in the South African economy. An acceptable role for the fund in this regard is normally negotiated between the government of the country and the fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of Finance Trevor Manuel is expecting a growth rate of 2,5% for 1997 (from an expected 3% this year). What is the bank's prediction and what interest rate are you assuming in anticipation of the slow- down in the economy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We agree with the minister's projected growth rate. We cannot reveal our predictions on interest rates because of the direct influence that the bank has on the determination of short-term interest rates. These rates are also influenced by sudden changes in the underlying conditions, such as the recent large outflows of short-term capital from South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How does the bank plan to lower real interest rates as proposed in the government's Gear document?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The level of real interest rates is dependent on the levels of nominal interest rates and the expected rate of inflation. The bank can influence nominal interest rates by changing bank rate. The inflation rate is the outcome of economic developments in South Africa and abroad as well as the broad macro-economic policy package pursued by the authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The level of real interest rates in the Gear document is based on the implementation of the macro-economic strategy, assumptions about developments in the domestic economy, such as normal agricultural conditions, and assumptions of developments in the economies of South Africa's major trading partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If all the proposals in the Gear document are implemented, real interest rates will decline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How long will it be before the current account deficit on the balance of payments starts to narrow?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trade statistics for the third quarter of 1996 indicate that the deficit on the current account narrowed sharply from the very high figure of the second quarter. Unfortunately, the latest depreciation of the rand could again produce leads and lags in imports and exports, which could delay the adjustment in this deficit. Normally with slower growth in production and expenditure the current account of the balance of payments adjusts relatively quickly. Under current conditions and taking the sharp depreciation of the rand into consideration, one could have expected a substantial and quick decrease in the current account deficit. This adjustment can, however, now be delayed if uncertainties continue to prevail in the foreign exchange market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conditions on the balance of payments are important in determining monetary and other macro-economic policies, because of the relatively low domestic savings of the country. If foreign reserves are also low, it places more pressure on monetary policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why, if economic indicators are pointing to a slow-down in the economy, is private credit extension still so buoyant?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Credit extension continued to be boosted by strong consumer and investor confidence, reflected in relatively high growth in real consumption expenditure and real fixed investment. Demand for working capital from small and medium-sized enterprises has also increased sharply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A switching from foreign to domestic financing of international transactions arising from the instability in the foreign exchange market this year also contributed to the steady credit demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On top of these shorter-term developments, important structural changes in the economy kept the demand for credit high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bank credit extension has continued to increase sharply as more and more younger people with a high propensity to consume are replacing workers in the age groups 50 to 65 years who are normally bigger savers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The explosive increase in the turnover on financial markets in recent years probably also contributed to high demand for credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the supply side, banks actively promoted the use of credit facilities, while a large number of retail outlets introduced in-house credit cards to encourage consumption expenditure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continued growth in credit extension is probably not a good indicator of the underlying strength of real economic activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank wants to withdraw from the forward cover market (one of the bank's main weapons to defend the rand). How has the rand's fall affected this policy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under present conditions the bank has no other choice than to remain an active participant in the forward currency market. The long-term objective is, however, to be involved in the forward market only on its own initiative when it deems it necessary to intervene in the market to prevent undue short- term fluctuations in the rand's exchange rate. The withdrawal will only be possible under more calm and stable conditions than those that we are experiencing currently.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - After months of exhaustive negotiations, three important South African trade agreements are firming up and could be concluded in the first half of 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although separate, the three are also closely linked and will affect each other in vital ways which will, hopefully, benefit not only South Africa but the region as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of Trade and Industry Alec Erwin told a media briefing at Parliament this week that &quot;exciting progress&quot; had been made in the negotiation of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and South African Customs Union (SACU) trade agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the government had &quot;finished our homework on the European Union mandate&quot; and would be discussing it with the parliamentary trade and industry committee and other interested parties over the next few weeks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SADC free trade agreement protocol, which he hoped would be in place in six months, &quot;will be an interesting one because it will be the first regional agreement since the Uruguay Round&quot;, Erwin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To the best of our knowledge it is the first substantial agreement between developing countries and less developed countries and that makes it an unusual agreement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it would have to be closely linked to the EU negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would make no sense whatsoever to improve EU access to our markets at a rate more rapid than the improved SADC access,&quot; he said. &quot;That would be detrimental to the regional development of this area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On SACU we have now essentially reached agreement. We just have to tie the bows and ring the bells on the revenue sharing formula. The basis of that agreement is that South Africa does not seek to gain further revenue from the formula but it is prepared to give stability to the SACU partners on their revenue share.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he warned that a problem &quot;looms&quot; for Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland because a free trade agreement in SADC and a probable reduction in tariffs for the EU would affect the revenue base. &quot;That is a matter that we will be talking to the EU about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erwin said South Africa's drive to improve trade and investment links with its neighbours was vital to future regional stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reason why we have moved so rapidly to try and establish better links on an investment and trade basis with Zimbabwe and Zambia is not just to be nice guys,&quot; he said. &quot;It fundamentally affects future stability of the area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, he said, the rapid increase in Zimbabwe's trade surplus in South Africa's favour &quot;cannot be accounted for by the Zimbabwean growth rate, even though it is quite healthy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not possible for the Zimbabwean growth rate to bring about the shift of 70 to 80%.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What was probably happening was that South African exporters were taking trade away from Zimbabwe's other trading partners, possibly in the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is one thing having a trade deficit with a whole lot of different countries, it is another having a trade deficit with your neighbour,&quot; Erwin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was why South Africa had upgraded its bilateral agreement with Zimbabwe and SACU members were negotiating assistance for Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement with Zambia would be &quot;structurally more complex ... than the one with Zimbabwe because it will be new&quot;, Erwin said. &quot;None of us ... want to open up a whole lot of bilateral trade agreements.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Zambia &quot;stood out like a sore thumb&quot; in the region because it had no preferential access to the South African market and the negotiations would be a precursor to the SADC free trade agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have agreed ... that we are prepared to make a special dispensation for Zambia and get it in line with the other major trading partners,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attention would also have to be paid to providing some assistance to Mauritius, who also did not have preferential access. One of the tricky issues to be tackled in the finalisation of the SADC free trade agreement is some agreement on controversial rules of origin specifics. &quot;If you have free trade between Malawi and South Africa and the product actually comes from China then you effectively have free trade between South Africa and China and that is a major problem ... so you have to devise rules,&quot; Erwin said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The rand's latest fall will push inflation higher, demanding the restrictive monetary policy which has previously forced up interest rates, Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals warns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an exclusive interview with the Mail &amp; Guardian, Stals also says it is anyone's guess where the embattled currency will settle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any person willing to predict at which level the rand will stabilise, under the present circumstances, would be very brave,&quot; he says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rand traded steadier to the dollar this week, trading at R4,71 as M&amp;G went to press on Thursday against R4,6885 at the start of the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stals says previous success in the battle with inflation has been the bank's greatest achievement since he took office in 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stals also warns that the latest currency turbulence may delay a hoped-for fall in the current account deficit, piling on the pressure on monetary policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A mooted loan from the International Monetary Fund could bolster the country's meagre foreign exchange reserves, he says. It could also lift foreign investor confidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">October's foreign reserve figures, due this week, were expected to have been hit by the bank's attempts to protect the rand by pumping dollars into forex markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Firmer trade figures and the successful Yankee-bond sale are expected to have cushioned the blow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week did see some positive economic news. The producer price index for September showed a moderate increase of 0,2% on August's figure. The figure surprised economists - many had expected a 1,2% rise, swollen by the rand's fall and higher oil prices. Fears remain that the figure is a statistical anomaly, with bigger rises still to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the South African Chamber of Business released October's business confidence index, showing confidence among its members has fallen to its lowest level in 14 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chamber is forecasting Christmas sales over the period November/December to hit R30-billion (current prices) from last year's R26,8- billion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Eskom is quietly replacing top staff at one of its largest divisions after an independent investigation uncovered rampant corruption and incompetence among senior management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parastatal declines to detail the shake- up at the Soweto division, saying its plans are still being discussed with management and unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigation, undertaken by Independent Mediation Services of South Africa (Imssa) earlier this year, has also been kept under wraps until now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Eskom has already shunted out Soweto division chief Ken Green, and transferred several of his underlings to other Eskom units.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imssa says senior heads should roll. Its three-month inquiry, prompted by union claims, found most of the 56 allegations it investigated to be true.  Its 200-page report is a damning indictment of the division's management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inquiry's findings include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Management handing lucrative contracts to firms owned by former Eskom staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Management failing to keep tabs on a disastrous R60-million meter contract last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Management accepting a night out at Sun City paid for by its contractors - Green's explanation was &quot;so improbable as to be untrue&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Eskom paying employment agencies R50 000 a month for effectively doing nothing - &quot;it is perfectly reasonable ... to draw the inference of kickbacks being given to management&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Managers helping themselves to Eskom property, and running their own businesses from Eskom offices during working hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report's other findings include management harassment of unions, apathetic performance by Eskom's internal investigators, and a breakdown in stock records which left the door wide open to theft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inquiry recommended disciplinary action against nine division managers.  Those named include Green, area managers Anton von Loggerenberg, Beaudine Symms, Mike Farmer, supervisors Sean Cooper, Ricky Dick and Frans Palm, and engineering department staff John Calvert and Jacques van der Brooke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are serious problems ... regarding the discipline of management, the inconsistent and unfair practices of management, the awarding of contracts, the huge benefits received by certain contractors who are owned and controlled by ex-Eskom employees, and racism,&quot; Imssa commissioner Bashier Vally says in the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the respective people are found to have breached Eskom's policy, dismissals should not be avoided.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report says several managers had tried to mislead the inquiry. Several were deemed grossly negligent, others were &quot;at best incompetent&quot;. The division has been vaunted as one of Eskom's success stories, particularly in cutting the levels of non-payment among users to less than 30% from 80% in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eskom's public relations office was initially unaware of the inquiry, but says the &quot;management problem&quot; is being handled internally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the issues raised have been resolved and appropriate action taken already,&quot; a representative says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many of the issues arose out of circumstances that were temporary in nature and subject to rapid change, hence decisions were taken which were not the norm at Eskom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report concentrates much of its fire on Eskom's contract allocations.  It calls for a full blown witch-hunt over the 1995 meter project in Soweto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The contract involved installing 117 000 meters into Soweto homes after Eskom took over electricity distribution in the township from the city council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inquiry found that more than 22 000 of the meters had already been installed, and so should not have formed part of the budget. The R60-million budget was spent anyway. Contractors were also paid regardless of performance (many meters were left in the streets - in one area, after a house exploded during installation). Much of the work was handed to Prominent Electrical, a company owned by a former Eskom employee. Work worth R4-million done by Eskom company Roshcon was so poor it had to be repeated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inquiry called for Green to be disciplined after he and 16 staff members accepted gifts from two Eskom contractors. They were flown to Sun City in Easter 1995 by Diemech, which services and repairs all Eskom vehicles.  Sipho Contractors, owned by former Eskom employee Ebon Pienaar, gave Green R3 000 to pay for the entertainment at the pleasure centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inquiry also heard how the division's security contractor Charlie Bravo was fired in September 1995 to make way for a company owned by a former Eskom employee, Albertus Muller. His firm, Icon, was registered six months before it won the R705 000 Soweto security contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eskom's use of employment agencies was open &quot;to enormous abuse and to the raising of suspicions and allegations of corruption which are not unduly wild&quot; , the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two agencies - Emmanuels and Executive Personnel - provided staff with the money- spinning work dished out to the agencies by one Eskom official. The agencies paid the employees 75% of what Eskom paid for the employees' services. The agencies pocketed the remainder, totalling R50 000 in December alone, as &quot;commission&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inquiry said the agencies were &quot;on to a good wicket&quot;. The staff they supplied Eskom, some since 1992, were just clerks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Minister of Defence Joe Modise takes a tough line on the 'arrogant mindset of the old SADF</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AT the time of our first ever democratic election, the thought in everyone's mind was whether the defence force would support change. The result thus far has been encouraging, bearing in mind that in defence, more than in any other state institution, the conflicting pressures of stability and transformation need to be sensitively managed. This is, by far, my ministry's greatest challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In any great venture, there will be obstacles and setbacks, but our achievements stand as testimony to the progress made in forging a new defence ethos and in maintaining the essential stability our country requires.  Whatever I do needs to be judged in terms of this equation. That being said, my ministry is committed to accelerating the transformation programme to strengthen and modernise defence for the 21st century.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first phase of transformation was amalgamating seven former antagonistic forces into a unified South African National Defence Force (SANDF). There has been no comparable transformation in any government department to date. Of the approximately 28 000 originally registered Umkhonto weSizwe (MK) and 6 000 Azanian People's Liberation Army (Apla) members, about 16 000 reported for integration and, of these, almost 4 000 chose to demobilise. Of those that integrated, almost 1 700 were appointed as officers - a remarkably high percentage - of which 150 are women. Of these officers, comprising about 10% of all regular force SANDF officers, 11 became generals, including the country's first black woman general. This group, together with the 500 officers from the former homelands' forces, is the strategic base from which to develop broad representivity of black officers at all levels of command.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunities (AAEO) programme will fast- track for promotion those with the greatest capability. But simple statistical parity is insufficient, and a comprehensive strategy is required.  Firstly, to ensure democratic control over the armed forces, a civilian defence secretariat was created. This secretariat, staffed with appointments reflective of a national liberation and gender background, has the responsibility to ensure policy is implemented. Additionally, the Integration Oversight Committee composed of members of Parliament, the secretariat and the SANDF, is a mechanism ensuring the overseeing of this programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Defence White Paper, the policy basis for transformation and the product of a thorough consultative process, was unanimously endorsed by Parliament last May. It provides the basis for our country's first ever National Defence Review. This review is determining the &quot;Three M's of Defence&quot; - money, machines and military personnel - at a time of socio-economic priorities and swingeing defence cuts. Defence requirements must flow from the White Paper, with the review providing options for a new force design, force levels, structures and equipment. This is a logical and transparent approach to appropriate funding, and the alternative to the emotional &quot;guns or butter&quot; debate. Public participation in the review process has been extensive. It is recognised as the most open and consultative defence review in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As important as our new equipment needs are for the 21st century, so too are appropriate attitudes and values, if we are to sustain an adequate defence force to protect our hard-won sovereignty. To create this new culture, I have established civic education, language and religion work groups together with the AAEO structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Important changes have also been made in the part-time forces. As one of my first actions, in July 1994, I ended the infamous apartheid conscription system. We now have an all-volunteer force which includes the part-time soldier - the &quot;citizen in uniform&quot; - as an integral part of our democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are in the process of establishing new structures, including the creation of new regiments to reflect the traditions of the struggle. Given that we are downsizing the SANDF, a Bill to facilitate the reintegration of demobilised combatants into civil society by providing for a demobilisation gratuity, has recently been introduced. I have created a Service Corps, dedicated to the training of ex-combatants in skills suitable to their reintegration into civilian life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My ministry has restored to veterans of the past - particularly of World War II - their dignity, for so long flouted by the previous government and we are in the process of setting up a Directorate of Veterans' Affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also initiated a National Conventional Arms Control Committee to ensure strict regulation of our arms industry. As early as October 1994 we stopped exporting land mines, and we support the United Nations move towards a worldwide ban on anti- personnel mines. Armscor is being restructured to ensure accountability and promote representivity with new appointments to the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reflecting our regional presence, we have become a member of the Inter- State Defence and Security Committee of the South African Development Community (SADC). We are expected to play a more active role in the region - with profound implications for defence capability - and I have initiated studies with regard to possible peace support operations in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The revision of the Defence Act is continuing, but must await the certification of the Constitution, and the results of the defence review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Halfway through my tenure of office is an appropriate point to ask: &quot;To what degree has the old order given way to the new?&quot; Certainly, dominant positions are still in the hands of former South African Defence Force (SADF) generals. Their jobs and pensions were, after all, guaranteed by Joe Slovo's so-called &quot;sunset clause&quot;. But change is underway, and I have made it clear that, in the interests of the SANDF, transformation must succeed and involve a change in the heart, mind and spirit of all who wish to serve. Those not prepared to change can take severance ahead of pending rationalisation, and I have recently signed 3 500 applications in this respect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I will simply not tolerate the mindset of the old SADF - which was so arrogantly displayed at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings in Bisho and Cape Town. But, I encourage and applaud all those, of whatever background, who are willing to participate in the great patriotic undertaking of building a defence force of national unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having established the framework for change, I aim to accelerate the process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - One of the curious aspects of the African National Congress in government is its paradoxical insistence on exercising its authority when it is not needed and failure to do so when it is. The paradox was on display again this week, with regard to Zaire and the leadership struggle in the Free State.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Terror Lekota similarly attempted to get rid of members of his cabinet in whom he had lost trust, the national leadership of the ANC not only told him he could not do it, but attempted to tie him to an &quot;agreement&quot; on how he behaved towards the rebels in future and eventually fired him for the breach of it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What, precisely, they believe they have gained by the exercise is difficult to fathom. Their interference in the affairs of the province has reinforced the national leadership's reputation for an overfondness for centralism.  Their plans to impose an &quot;interim&quot; administration on the province - and the gerrymandering they will have to do to make it legal - is a negation of democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Odds are that when the provincial congress is eventually held, Lekota will be re- elected premier and it will all be back to square one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would have been far better if the national leadership had given Lekota their unstinting support from the start and invited the rebels - whom he has accused of corruption and suchlike - to demonstrate their innocence of the charges in the courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If they had succeeded in doing so, Lekota's political career would have been snuffed out and the party in the province could have gone ahead to elect a new premier who, in turn, could have appointed a cabinet in whom he or she had confidence. If they had failed to do so, they themselves would have been consigned to political obscurity, leaving Lekota to run the province with the help of a supportive ministerial team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where Zaire is concerned, the behaviour of the ANC in government is the exact opposite. Countries in Africa and beyond are crying out for a lead from Pretoria. Daniel Arap Moi calls a summit in Kenya to discuss the crisis. Our government fails to send the president, or his deputy, or even the foreign minister. Instead it dispatches a &quot;special envoy&quot; to act as an observer, along with a bizarre message to African heads of state that South Africa will agree to anything they decide. There can hardly be a more startling demonstration of an abrogation of responsibility in the field of foreign affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course it is possible to explain this contradictory approach to the exercise of power. The ANC - as has been demonstrated by the Holomisa affair - is obsessed by a desire for party unity at all costs. This seemingly reflects its failure to make the transition from liberation movement to political party. It's intolerance of dissent smacks of a government at war.  Despite their massive majority, they are unable to act with the confidence demanded by peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lack of confidence similarly blights our foreign policy. There are, obviously, dangers in being caught up in foreign wars. But the feeble gestures we have been making towards the peace-keeping process -- and the equally feeble excuses we have been offering for avoiding material engagement - threatens to make us a laughing stock in Africa. When the Lekota controversy blew up in the Free State, the ANC dispatched a high-level crisis- management team south to Bloemfontein. They would have been of more service if they had gone north.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - The recent disclosure that a Malaysian company has secured logging rights in Zimbabwe's pristine forest reserves has set alarm bells ringing in Harare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move represents a further incursion by the Malaysians who have recently taken a large slice of the country's power utility, moved into the troubled telecoms sector, and are operating in the construction industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of a Malaysian company involved in a project to build 12 000 homes in Bulawayo, Dr Hassan Ali, also heads the Hasedat Corporation which recently signed a memorandum of understanding with Vice President Joshua Nkomo's Development Trust of Zimbabwe (DTZ) to undertake logging in various parts of the country. The Forestry Commission has also been approached to supply timber which Ali says will be used for the housing project.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 50 000ha of state and communal land is thought to be involved.  Ali visited Zimbabwe last week for talks which are expected to translate his agreement with the DTZ and the Forestry Commission into firm logging concessions involving mahogany, mopani, mukwa and teak. Nkomo's multi- tentacled DTZ has considerable leverage with rural district councils in Matabeleland in the south of the country, which control local woodlands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Malaysian connection has moved centre stage recently with President Robert Mugabe vigorously defending his government's decision to allow Malaysia's YTL Corporation a 51% share in the Hwange power station, Zimbabwe's largest thermal plant. A project to boost output at Hwange had originally been put out to tender, but Mugabe pre-empted the outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers believe Mugabe cut the R3-billion deal in private talks with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed and then instructed his ministers to sort out the details. When the board of Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (Zesa) protested, its members were promptly fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics of the agreement describe it as back-door privatisation and say it contradicts the government's oft-proclaimed goal of transferring ownership of the economy to indigenous Zimbabweans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Branding the deal &quot;Powergate&quot;, economist Eric Bloch has called for a parliamentary inquiry to see if anything &quot;sinister or untoward&quot; transpired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloch points out that YTL was the least qualified of those bidding for the Hwange tender which included prominent American and European power companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When four Western countries joined the chorus of protest, Mugabe told them to &quot;go to hell&quot;. But senior United States officials made it clear to the president at a recent regional investment conference in Harare that deals of this sort were unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such awards &quot;could cause irreparable damage to the leaders and countries concerned and to our efforts to promote United States business interests here due to the lack of transparency&quot;, said director general of the United States commercial service Laurie Fitz-Pegado as Mugabe sat expressionless just metres away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former United States diplomat Chester Crocker warned investors would lose confidence in the region if contracts were &quot;warped by political favouritism or improper dealings&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another controversial development, the Malaysian company Celcom has stolen a march on local black businessmen hoping to participate in the Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (PTC)'s new cellphone project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Celcom approached Mugabe directly for permission to set up a joint venture offering management and technical support to the PTC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Black Zimbabweans should have no illusions now about indigenisation,&quot; said one bitter entrepreneur who was sidelined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahathir's son is also thought to be involved in both the YTL/Zesa and Celcom/PTC deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, environmental organisations are deeply worried by the prospect of logging concessions in Zimbabwe's forestry estates, given the record of Malaysian logging companies elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prominent conservationist Dick Pitman said he was &quot;horrified&quot; by the news. &quot; What will be the extraction rate?&quot; he asked. &quot;Who benefits, what monitoring mechanisms will be put in place?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These questions appear to be of little concern to those busy cutting deals - and cutting down trees. Affirmative Action Group president Philip Chiyangwa, however, is in no doubt as to who will benefit. Describing the Malaysians as new colonialists, he said they invariably took advantage of their partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have always been suspicious of the Malaysians. All deals involving them are suspicious,&quot; he warned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Zambian government has sworn it will prosecute former president Kenneth Kaunda in the face of upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections on November 18. Kaunda has been holding rallies around the country in the last week, asking people to turn their voters' registration cards over to his party, so as to effect a mass voter boycott.  He has already collected over 300000 cards.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Kaunda was initially in the running for a presidential comeback in the elections, he was forced to withdraw after the government amended the Constitution earlier this year, disallowing anyone with foreign parents - including Kaunda - from running for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda plans to collect at least 1,8-million of the 2,2-million voters' cards issued, to petition the Zambian Supreme Court to have the election results declared null and void on grounds of low voter turn-out, and to force fresh elections, hopefully following another constitutional amendment which would allow him to contest the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Home Affairs Minister Chitalu Sampa said this week that the government would prosecute Kaunda. &quot;Wrongfully inducing a boycott of elections is an offence under section 92 of the Penal Code punishable by six months' imprisonment without an option of a fine,&quot; Sampa said. &quot;Government's patience with Kaunda's antics has run out. It's not a question of if. We are going to arrest him, charge and prosecute him for attempting to disrupt elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police spokesman Francis Musonda said 10 officials working for Kaunda's United National Independence Party (Unip) have been arrested so far, and will appear in court next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Kaunda said at a press conference earlier this week he would not be cowed by threats of prosecution, and that the police should arrest him rather than his workers. &quot;Don't arrest Unip members. Come and arrest me, the party president, who issued the instructions for people to surrender their voters' cards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Sampa was adamant that Kaunda's prosecution is imminent, the Law Association of Zambia has said there is nothing illegal about the collection of the cards. The association's chairman, Sakwiba Sikota, said this week: &quot;It is a perfectly legitimate way of expression of disapproval. There is nothing illegal about urging people to surrender their cards and boycott the impending polls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some election monitoring groups, among them Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZMIT), have similarly said charges against Kaunda would not stick. ZMIT chairman Alfred Zulu said: &quot;What Kaunda and Unip are doing is a civic right, which is vital in a democracy. I doubt whether the charge will hold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To undercut Kaunda's scheme, the elections office has appealed to people who have given away their cards to apply for temporary ones. Election office press liaison officer Joel Sikazwe said: &quot;We can supply those at short notice, even days before the polls date.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some opposition parties who have decided not to boycott the polls have castigated Kaunda's move as conterproductive. Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) general secretary Azwell Banda said: &quot;Kaunda's actions are cowardly and foolish. Why should we all boycott the elections just because his party is boycotting? If he is not interested in the polls, he must keep off.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paris - International efforts to get a reluctant Mobutu Sese Seko to return to Zaire from his Riviera villa increased this week when he was asked to co- operate with French plans for a multi-national force to protect refugees in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Jacques Chirac is trying to persuade Zaire's president, convalescing after surgery for prostate cancer, that he must go home to take advantage of a three- week truce by the Tutsi rebels in eastern Zaire and set up protected corridors to enable supplies to reach refugees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But hopes that Mobutu would take a lead in settling the crisis received a setback right away: Zaire refused to attend a special meeting of African states in Nairobi on Tuesday to discuss the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without Zaire's participation, the meeting's call for urgent deployment of a neutral force in eastern Zaire was weakened. The United States ambassador in Rwanda, Robert Gribbin, has also described military intervention as &quot; useless&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda - which backs the Tutsi rebels in eastern Zaire - also opposes foreign intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu was apparently given a French visa on the understanding he would retake control of domestic affairs, but he has told officials that he needs a long recovery.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goma - Mobutu Sese Seko has paid only one visit to his palatial holiday home on Lake Kivu. That was six years ago and he will not be going back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Zaire's president recuperates in his villa on the French Riviera from a cancer operation, looters pick away at the bones of his sprawling mansion on the edge of Goma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan-backed rebels took the provincial capital in eastern Zaire at the weekend. By then, hundreds of bodies littered the streets. Red Cross workers said they had already buried more than 400, most of them civilians, in mass graves.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the city's residents fled with the army. Some of those who remained said government soldiers gave civilians their weapons, told them to carry on fighting and ran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few people were so stupid. Some hid. Others went looting. President Mobutu's holiday home was an early target, perhaps as much out of spite as for its pickings. Few people are so hated in the region as Zaire's leader.  Perhaps that is why he has only ever been once.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The front of the main house - badly modelled on a French chateau - offers spectacular lake views. At the back and around the corner the views are of dozens of families crammed into half-finished buildings and living in grinding poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The car park is home to the only two ambulances in the province, spotlessly awaiting the president who never comes. Goma's main hospital less than a mile down the road has no anaesthetics. Beside the ambulances are five gleaming black Mercedes. Behind them is a Land Rover with carpeted steps up the back to carry the president grandly through Goma. It has the number plate &quot;P&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The looters did not touch the cars. They concentrated on the practical by cleaning out the wine collection - which took up an entire room - the bedding, the televisions and the light fittings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They turned their noses up at the plastic Romanesque plinths, the giant fake Ming vases and the imitation marble tables which cluttered the living and dining rooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu might not have been there in six years but his holiday home was kept ready should the fancy take him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the looters' best efforts elsewhere in the house, the his and hers bathrooms remain immaculate. His is done out in sky blue with stereo speakers built into the ceiling. The centrepiece is a large whirlpool bath decorated around the edges with big bottles of aftershave and bath salts. Hers is fitted in pink and burgundy, with giant bottles of Chanel perfume and a gold- coloured pillow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu and his wife have separate bedrooms. Beside her bed is an album with photos of herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The palace guards obviously did not defend it for very long, if at all. A machine gun stands abandoned by the entrance. Unopened boxes of ammunition are stored in back rooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In place of the absent guards are young men who the Rwandans say are nothing to do with them. But many of the rebels on the streets of Goma this week were speaking Rwanda's native tongue, and some who grew up as Tutsi exiles in Uganda even shouted in English.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A couple of the rebels wandered around the house. They touched nothing, perhaps as astonished as the looters at Mobutu's taste. But it seems doubtful the Mercedes will sit unused for long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebels had done their own plundering in other parts of the city; expropriated United Nations vehicles are the most common means of transport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu was not the only target of the rampage. The centre of Goma, never an alluring town, was ripped apart. Shops along the main street had been plundered of their pathetic contents. Outside a clinic, packets of condoms were strewn everywhere. Apparently no one in Goma has any use for them. Money was discarded in the streets, so devalued that no one bothered to pick it up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even this week, with rebels everywhere, the temptation to loot was not resisted. Two Zaireans pulled a fridge past Mobutu's palace on a wheelbarrow.  They got away. Others were not so lucky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five young men sat on the ground with their heads bowed between their knees.  A rebel soldier walked by and beat each across the back with a piece of metal. Then they were piled into a commandeered United Nations car and driven off.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The South African-born British Labour Party MP Peter Hain is to ask the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate whether South African security police framed him on bank theft charges in London in 1975.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hain, who was a driving force behind the sports boycott of South Africa during the apartheid era, is in the country as the guest of the African National Congress to take part in a parliamentary workshop for ANC whips.  While here he will approach the commission, armed with new evidence of South African security police involvement in his arrest and trial, which he reveals in his forthcoming book, Sing, the Beloved Country: The Struggle for the New South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will be asking the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to examine the relevant records and call as witnesses the officials in charge at the time and those who would have been involved. Someone, somewhere, knows all about it,&quot; Hain told the Mail &amp; Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case involved the theft of about Pounds 490 from Barclays Bank near his home in Putney. Hain was acquitted after a two-week trial on grounds of &quot; mistaken identity&quot;, but evidence has mounted over the years that he was framed by the South African secret service, then known as the Bureau for State Security (Boss), apparently working in collaboration with British intelligence agents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hain said he was implicated in a call made to Scotland Yard which emanated from British intelligence operatives. Former Boss operative Gordon Winter referred to South African involvement in his 1981 expos', Inside Boss - &quot;but at the time he was not seen as credible&quot;, Hain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet former British intelligence agent Peter Wright later described in his book, Spycatcher, a right-wing faction within MI5 at the time which was collaborating with the South African security apparatus. And a former Northern Ireland British intelligence agent, Colin Wallace, told Hain independently the Scotland Yard tip-off had come from British intelligence. &quot; This gave it credibility,&quot; Hain said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He understood that the commission was overburdened with work. &quot;This is partly why I have never pressed it before. However, the case does open the book on illegal dirty tricks the old South Africa played abroad and in which many South Africans suffered and lost their lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Active in the Anti-Apartheid Movement from 1967, Hain became Labour MP for Neath, South Wales, in 1991 and is presently a Labour shadow employment minister.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - An immigration consultancy is making preparations to bring 55 000 Chinese families into South Africa next year from Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Gauteng-based company, Exec-Immigration, confirmed this week that they had landed a contract to handle the massive influx with the developers of the Dragon City Project adjoining Potchefstroom, the linked Lion's Estate Project in Randburg and China Village outside Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A document from the office of North-West Premier Popo Molefe indicates the Dragon City developers are bracing themselves for a public outcry over the arrival of thousands of Chinese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dragon City is a grandiose scheme which aims to build a Chinese mini-city on more than 4 000 hectares of land. The developers claim that within six years it will comprise 550 000 housing units, about 500 factories, warehouses, shopping centres, schools, cr_ches, a hospital, a hotel and casino, a cultural centre, sporting and training facilities and clubs, an exhibition centre, a floating waterfront and a railway station.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief executive of Exec-Immigration, Isak van der Merwe, said they were handling immigration applications for Dragon City Project (Pty) Ltd and Tai Ross Investments, which is handling the China Village Development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Full details of the Dragon City project are expected to be announced on November 12. But a memorandum of understanding signed by the North-West government and the project directors - Larry Botes and Celina Zheng - says the city will be built with private finance and is backed by all the premiers of China's 15 provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zheng, a businesswoman, claims the Chinese provincial premiers are all her &quot; intimate friends&quot; and &quot;have given their blessing&quot; to the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document says: &quot;We anticipate a major public debate once the news breaks ... and the project will need the assistance of the provincial government in dealing with each of these as it crops up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botes, a property developer, says in the document that they expect opposition to the project to come from Cosatu, opposition parties, vested business interests, conservative Potchefstroom townsfolk and members of the public complaining about the importation of so many Chinese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already there have been reports of Potchefstroom dominees preaching against the &quot;yellow peril&quot; from their pulpits. Yet Dominee Jurie Wessels of the Dutch Reformed Moederkerk in Potchefstroom told the Mail &amp; Guardian that the church had not taken a position against the Chinese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would change Potchefstroom but economically speaking I would be very glad they came, provided they would make an input and not just extract. There is a division of opinion in the town but it's the people's opinions, not the church's.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botes did not respond to requests by the M&amp;G for an interview. According to the document, however, he has been compiling responses and rebuttals in anticipation of the objections to give to Molefe &quot;as the news breaks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the document says 90% of the Chinese families would return to China after two-year contracts, the directors are anticipating problems with the Department of Home Affairs and asking for Molefe's help to fast-track applications for work permits and visas. They suggest Molefe set up a one- stop Home Affairs office in Dragon City to facilitate paper work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a glossy pamphlet presenting the Dragon City Project, Botes claims: &quot;The Minister of Home Affairs, Dr (Mangosuthu) Buthelezi, has given his assurance that an office would be established in Beijing and one in Johannesburg, to handle only Dragon City applications for visas, work permits and permanent residence for the carriers of both private and business passports, thus ensuring that all applications would be dealt with speedily and efficiently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pamphlet also promises every assistance from local and provincial governments, and tax benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Merwe said that Home Affairs would approve the families' applications for work permits or permanent residence permits because each family would be bringing &quot;at least R1,5-million&quot; for investment in South Africa. A large number of the families would be working on a contract basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exec-Immigration, which claims to have a 98% success rate in getting people through immigration, charges US$4 000 per family if they apply to Home Affairs from outside the country, and R5 000 if they make their application through Exec-Immigration from inside South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Merwe is a private businessman. His company employs former Home Affairs Department officials. He denied that he would be a millionaire by the time he had finished processing all the Chinese applications. His company was just trying to help people through the difficult process of immigration, he said. He had got the idea for starting the company from his brother- in-law who heads the South African Police Services aliens unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gerhard du Preez, of Tai Ross Investments, confirmed he intended trying to bring 3 800 Chinese families to settle in China Village north-east of Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the project would include a golf course, hotel and factories. He said building the development would create 6 000 jobs and maintaining it another 6 000 jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of the Chinese Association of South Africa, Eric Yensson, told the M&amp;G that his organisation had not been consulted about the projects and he was sceptical about them. The Taiwanese embassy and Chinese representatives in South Africa said they had no knowledge of the projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year Business Day newspaper reported that China had promised an US$18- billion investment in Dragon City. This was equivalent to eight times South Africa's total gold and foreign exchange reserves and was &quot; particularly breathtaking&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durban - Minister of Land Affairs Derek Hanekom went to KwaZulu-Natal to give away land, but it turned out to be no easy task, as this week's guest writer discovered:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE are shooting north up the mountain pass to the dusty outpost of Jozini, which overlooks the shimmering plains of the Makathini Flats stretching east and north. A cool, sunglassed bodyguard from the VIP Protection Unit drives the 4x4 as fast as the traffic-blind goats and cattle will allow. His colleague, next to him, rests an R5 rifle gently against his knee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the top of the mountain pass, down towards the Pongola Dam, the fourth- largest in the country, east towards the flats where hardly anyone has running water, goes the new government in its hired car. Derek Hanekom, the minister of agriculture and land affairs, is easy but intent in his open- necked shirt. He is here today to give land away, or at least to discuss how it should be done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not simple. In communities dominated by traditional leaders, who have - traditionally - allocated land, whom do you give the land to? Those who live on it? Those who work it? Or those who parcel it out?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maputaland, which includes the stretch of the Makathini Flats, is one of the few areas of KwaZulu-Natal not owned by the Zulu king. Vast tracts - mainly along the Pongola floodplain - are good land, arable land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No title deed means it's hard for black farmers to get credit. So often the problem presents itself as money. Everyone asks Hanekom for money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here he is at the Mgindi experimental farm, a project, run mainly by white extension officers from KwaZulu-Natal, that services farmers in the dry southern part of the Makathini Flats. He asks a young black woman, Maria Hlabisa, the community liaison officer: &quot;If we want to transform this area into a new paradise, what are the main things that need to be done?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can say it's money. We've got land here, but the main problem is money.  They don't have instruments to plough. They don't have money to buy things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't have to do anything as far as land ownership is concerned?&quot; asks Hanekom. &quot;People don't want to own their land?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maria Hlabisa smiles, then laughs &quot;Yes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, they DO,&quot;confirms Hanekom, his point made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We drive further north along the dust track, parallelling the river's course, until it curves slowly towards us and the land becomes greener.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mboza is a village set in the middle of the floodplain, near one of the pans which fills to the brim and spills over on to the bright couch grass during the rainy season. It has been the preserve of a few key rural development workers from the anti- apartheid organisations of old. One such is blond, balding, ponytailed Clive Poultney, who helped set up water committees here more than a decade ago. They negotiated with the Department of Water Affairs about when and how much water to release from the Pongola Dam every year. Before that, people's crops simply got flooded and their livestock sometimes drowned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poultney is well-established in the area. Years ago the chief gave him land on the edge of the Nsimbi Pan. Like everyone else here, he doesn't own it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The soil here is richer, richer than the southern sandforest. The prospects may be, too. Perhaps that is why the voices are stronger, the problem more clearly articulated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a small, sunny hall, peasant farmers, local health workers, water committee members fold themselves on to low schoolroom benches. &quot;We have 30 000 hectares of irrigable soil, there is a unique wetland that lends itself to productive fisheries as well as opportunities for ecotourism,&quot; says Poultney. &quot;People who use those resources have had difficulty in commercialising - or improving - the resource base to generate income. And largely this is a function of the fact that there is no land security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is echoed by everyone. Sipho Ngxonxo, a regional health director, is soft-spoken but adamant: &quot;The farmer can't develop his land. He can't even plant a tree because the land doesn't belong to him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In case this sounds too robust a nod to unfettered capitalism in the rural areas, Poultney is quick to qualify it: there can be different forms of land tenure. The cotton farmers in the south might want individual title, but those up near the Mozambican border in a settlement called Mbangweni may want communal tenure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Someone else asks Hanekom for money. He laughs: &quot;I don't usually walk around with a chequebook in my pocket. But I do walk around with land in my pockets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He doesn't want the land, he says. But HOW does he get rid of it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister is polite, affable as always, but he's clearly impatient.  Firstly, he's hungry. The meeting has dragged well past the lunch hour.  Secondly, this is his third meeting in this little hall, and he wants to start seeing changes: &quot;Let me be quite frank. As minister of quite a difficult portfolio, I want to succeed. But I need you, and largely you need me in order to succeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Effectively it means that if there are some people who really stand in the way, first we try to take them with us, but then we must go ahead boldly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He exhorts them to draw up a list of what they want: &quot;It might be a long list. You might want a soccer field, you might want a swimming pool. You might want a ROCKET - I don't know - even a golf course - but clearly if you want land tenure and ownership of the land, the next meeting you organise must be with Ben Ngubane, my friend and counterpart in the provincial government. He was invited today and he couldn't make it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a late lunch - a feast of meat and pap at Poultney's homestead - a large, smiling, gap-toothed man corners Hanekom. He is Mzimgeli Masuku of the Makathini Farmers Association. If, he asks uNgqonqoshe - the minister - he's doing well growing sugar cane on his five hectares, and his neigbour isn't, why shouldn't he be able to buy up his neighbour's plot? All this takes a long time to say, particularly as he says it in Zulu and it has to be translated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally Hanekom replies: &quot;If we were to start afresh, we give everybody the chance to buy five hectares, for the sake of equity. If there aren't enough applicants then others can buy more. But we take more people with us. And then that natural process that my good comrade is talking about - and that I completely agree with - the person who does well should be able to consolidate. But give people a chance to begin with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further north still, there is no talk of buying land, although, as always, there is of money. By now, we have abandoned the 4x4 to the bodyguards, still cool in the dust and heat, and flown by helicopter from the Ndumo Gane Reserve east along the Mozambican border fence, hovering over the Mbangweni Corridor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbangweni is deep in the sand forest, a remote settlement in a web of endless sand tracks that continue a spidery trail to the flimsy border fence and beyond. Home to about 150 families, the scattered huts are sandwiched between the two game reserves, Ndumo and Tembe, which the conservation authorities have wanted for years to consolidate. The elephants in Tembe can't get to the water that flows in abundance through Ndumo. But neither can the people of Mbangweni. They once lived where Ndumo is now, near the confluence of the Pongola and Usuthu rivers, but were moved to make way for the game park in the 1940s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For years, the villagers resisted removal from this corridor. They were backed by rural development workers, such as Poultney. It was an intensely political battle, accentuated by the suspicion that Tembe was used as a training camp for Renamo soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now things have changed. Poultney has been key in workshopping a new deal for Mbangweni, whereby the two game parks will consolidate, the villagers will stay in the corridor, but move further south, and in return they will regain access to a corner of Ndumo where the Pongola River flows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Change is what Hanekom has come to speak about. But change, for this community, has always been cruel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hanekom stands before them under a tree. The villagers are seated behind a dilapidated barbed-wire fence, in the dust. The induna, Plankkop Tembe, tells him they have big hopes. It is the first time a minister has been here. They want to tell him things, like: &quot;We were chased out like dogs from our old floodplain not knowing what wrong did we do.&quot; Or, as a youth said: &quot;Look at me. I am thin, uncommonly thin. And we never finished school. The reason is that the land was taken from our fathers and forefathers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or that women have to go through a fence to a nearby pan in Ndumo to fetch water. This year alone, five women have been taken by crocodiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Someone asks whether they will be removed from their land. And anyway, whose land is it? Someone else asks the minister for money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hanekom laughs, but there are few jokes in this meeting. The absence of Hanekom's Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) provincial counterpart is more keenly felt. Some wonder whether it's deliberate or an oversight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you are sitting here today,&quot; says Hanekom, &quot;you did not necessarily vote for this government. Maybe you voted for another party ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other party is not with him. But he wants to talk about change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has three questions. Do you want change? What kind of change do we want? And are we ready for that change?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You asked whether you will be removed from your land. The answer is no.  Maybe some people have plans but they may as well bury their plans because this is not allowed. The question is, though, do you want to stay here forever? The answer is largely up to yourselves.&quot; Then on to the question of ownership: &quot;The induna (headman) may say this is all my land. Maybe there's an inkosi (chief) somewhere who says 'uh, uh, this is all MY land'. Maybe the government says, so where's your title deed? Officially this land on which you live, graze your cattle, belongs to the government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd begins to bristle. A woman says that even if they didn't vote for him on paper, deep down in their hearts they did. She says it's like they have no government now. No water, no clinics, no schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A firebrand group sitting on the front row of chairs where only important people like the minister and the induna sit exhort the minister to cut the fence into the game reserve. Everyone thought the minister had come to tell them to go back to their old land. This group calls itself the Top Ten. They are not from Mbangweni, but from the nearby town of KaNgwanase, nicely situated on the tar road with a hospital and running water. They are a crowd- pleaser nonetheless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A cry goes up to cut the fence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hanekom holds his ground: &quot;No, I can't cut the fence. It's not mine to cut.&quot; He is looking for vision. Real options. &quot;I know your lives have been difficult. But think with a vision. Think big things, not small things, because then big things happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The game reserves are important, he says, to the region, and to the country.  There is a tribe that was moved out of the Kruger Park, who have put in a land claim, just as this community has, but instead of opting to go back, they've gone forward and set up a private game lodge in a joint venture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He tells the story of himself, a farmer who went to jail for the struggle.  He's not complaining. He tells of Nelson Mandela who went to jail for 27 years because he wanted change. He's not complaining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apartheid rode roughshod over countless black communities. But you can't go back. Do you want change? he asks again. And for the better?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Top Ten are not mollified. Where are the chiefs? Why were they not invited?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Top Tenner, Albert Fakude, who is a local IFP member, skirts the crowd.  He tells me: &quot;We are concerned that the amakhosi (chiefs) aren't here.  Without consultation with the amakhosi at a national level, and even in our region, we cannot dicuss the land.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hanekom, though, plays a bad hand well: I respect the leaders. But the most important people are these people,&quot; he says, gesturing to the crowd seated cross-legged in the dust. &quot;A true leader recognises that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is easier for people to move ahead boldly on the land question when they can see the future, as the sugar cane farmer on the floodplain can. He doesn't care an iota what the chiefs think. When vision is clouded by hunger and thirst, as it is here, it's difficult to see far ahead. Only what once was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it does not help Hanekom that this is fuelled by chiefs, spoken for by the Top Ten, and, Poultney tells me later, a more sinister lobby: gun-runners for whom the Mbangweni Corridor presents better access from Mozambique than a well-fenced game park would.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today the guns, if not the runners, are there. For the first time, I see the minister's cool bodyguard a little ruffled. He walks - fast - towards me.  &quot;I must get the minister out of here,&quot; he says. &quot;Many people are armed. All those who've come in from the outside have R5s.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The helicopter throbs and whirls Hanekom away, over the land, his pockets of land, which he wants so badly to give away.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Democratic Party's decision to reposition itself does not mean the terrier will stop snapping at the heels of government. But instead of just leveling criticism, it will also be offering solutions to problems facing the country, DP leader Tony Leon said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its first offering - a strategy to deal with crime - will be revealed next week at a combined meeting of the party's national, provincial and local government caucuses in Durban. Leon has already canvassed the idea with President Nelson Mandela, whom, he said, welcomed the intervention.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We weren't sent to Parliament just to vent the outrage of those who elected us, although that's part of it,&quot; Leon said. &quot;Attacking the African National Congress on crime is like shooting fish in a barrel. You can win the debate, but it doesn't solve the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our crime strategy offers practical ways of dealing with problems like police corruption. It details practical steps that can be implemented now, that are cost- effective.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to reshape itself as a &quot;constructive opposition&quot; and abandon any notion of fighting the 1999 elections in alliance with other political parties was informed, to a large degree, by inputs from political analysts, businessmen and industrialists at a seminar the party held in August &quot;where we asked people to tell us where we should be positioned&quot;, Leon said. &quot;The overwhelming view was that other political parties as currently constituted are not compatible with our value system ... it was felt that we should go it alone for the moment, though there may be breaks and faults in the political landscape in the future.&quot; The DP would thus not be trading its credibility and independence in order to &quot;sanitise&quot; the National Party by joining forces with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NP leader FW De Klerk announced on February 2 this year his intention to forge a new political movement. He beat the same rhetorical drum this week, promising journalists at an end-of-session function a few surprises in 1997, but so far has nothing to show in terms of initiatives he claims will &quot;change the party political pattern in South Africa fundamentally and for the long term&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leon believes the NP has failed lamentably in its role as official opposition. But he is not discounting the possibility of co- operation at provincial level, particularly in the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal, and on specific issues. DP provincial structures had been asked to present proposals on alignments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will co-operate provincially and on specific issues provided this does not increase the hegemony of the ANC or constitute an ethnic ganging-up,&quot; Leon said. &quot;We have a responsibility to provide a counterweight to the ANC, but we need to be proactive and offer genuine solutions in our opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no way we are going to compromise on our opposition role, but in itself it's not going to be enough if we are going to remain relevant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of all the opposition parties in Parliament, the DP - with just seven MPs - is by far the most effective. Its bid to reposition itself as a niche party wielding influence out of all proportion to its size will depend, to a large extent, on it being able to match its performance outside Parliament to that within it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is too much reliance on our parliamentary performance and this must change,&quot; Leon said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Sakkie Van Niekerk had just spotted Willie, who had caused a bit of bother by hiding in a thick copse of trees on the farm near Pretoria, and was getting ready to fire a dart packed with powerful sedatives into his backside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, wouldn't you also hide away if you were going to have your horn cut off in public?&quot; asked Van Niekerk as he drank a cup of coffee with a group of journalists who had come to watch the early morning operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vet got into a chopper with his dart gun and a few minutes later Willie, a rogue white rhino bull who has taken to killing his own male offspring on the farm, was staggering through the bush with a train of scientists, photographers, conservationists and curious onlookers running behind him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Willie dropped haplessly on to his side, the vet used a large white bandage to blindfold him, the conservationists pushed the beast on to its knees so that his rib cage would not be crushed by the sheer weight of his torso and Van Niekerk took out his chainsaw. Five minutes later, with shavings of the dense keratin that rhino horn is made of lying around his massive face , Willie was without his horn and Sakkie's colleagues were cracking jokes about how sexy he was going to be in bed that night after inhaling all that aphrodisiac dust.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An antidote was administered to Willie's ear and within minutes the animal rose to his feet and trotted off to the copse of bushes. &quot;I could probably get $30 000 for this horn in the Far East. That's more than R130 000 and it will grow back in two years when I can cut it again,&quot; said Van Niekerk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe that the best way to conserve rhino is for the ban on trading in horn to be lifted so that we can farm with these animals just like any other form of livestock. Then there's big money to be made out of rhinos and farmers will increase the amount of land that they set aside for rhino.  That's the best way to save them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm going to put this horn in a bank and we members of the African Rhino Owners Association (AROA) are going to push for the trade in horn to be legalised. You know if you ban something you push it underground. If you legalise it you can control it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dehorning of Willie was, therefore, for two reasons: to prevent the rhino bull from goring young rivals to death and to demonstrate in public that it was possible to conserve rhinos by allowing farmers like Van Niekerk to treat them in much the same way as cattle or horses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea of farming with rhinos in this way is fast gaining ground among conservationists and private owners of these animals and, a few hours after the chain saw operation on Willie, delegates to AROA formally decided to push for an end to the ban imposed by the Convention on Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) on international sales of rhino horn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The two major causes for the decline in rhino numbers worldwide are the loss of habitat and direct human exploitation. There are documented uses for a whole range of rhino body parts including the skin, bones, fat, blood, heart, stomach, penis, horns, hooves, teeth, eyes, tail hairs and even dung and urine. The two main uses for the horn are medicinal and ornamental - and not for aphrodisiacs as is popularly believed,&quot; says Barry James, a conservation expert at the University of Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The horn is ground into a powder for the treatment of fever in the Far East and in the Middle East its major use is ornamental. Yemeni men wear traditional daggers called janbiyyas which have ornate handles carved from a variety of substances. The most sought after are those made from rhino horn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is such a fervent belief in the power of rhino horn in medicine and janbiyyas are so much part of Yemeni culture, that in spite of trade being illegal, it will always take place, no matter what the risks. The price will simply escalate,&quot; says James.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People often compare the trade in rhino horn to that in ivory. But the comparison is invalid. The consumption of ivory in Western countries virtually ceased because of a well-orchestrated media campaign against it and because ivory is viewed in those countries as a luxury. The use of rhino in Eastern countries is a firmly established cultural 'necessity' and will entail a complete change in culture. This is highly unlikely, either in the immediate or distant future ... So why not farm them for their horns?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Support for the lifting of Cites bans on trade in the products of elephants and rhino came from another source this week. About 100 delegates from villages along the western border of the Kruger National Park backed plans by Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe to lobby for elephants to be removed from the Cites trade ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The villagers proposed that they be allowed to stage controlled safaris for trophy hunters inside the park in order to generate revenues for their communities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The campaign against gangsterism and drugs will intensify in the next few weeks and Cape Town's Waterfront could see more protests, People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad) said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last weekend, Achmat Najjaar, the brother of a prominent Muslim scholar Sheikh Thafier Najjaar, was shot and killed during a clash with the police at the Waterfront.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tourism industry has reported cancellations for the festive season in Cape Town, and Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi said the government would enforce the Regulations of Gatherings Act which governs the conduct of protestors and allows police to disperse them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had a meeting with (Justice Minister) Dullah Omar and (Cape Attorney General) Frank Khan. Khan asked us to keep a low profile for a week or two, but we have decided we are stepping up the campaign,&quot; said an unidentified Pagad leader whose face was covered in a scarf at a press conference this week. &quot;We are going to intensify the campaign, whether it is at the Waterfront, Manenberg or Table Mountain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People keep asking why we went to the Waterfront to protest. Is it only open to people who come there with money to spend? We have a drug problem, we have the right to tell the world about our problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another Pagad leader, Aslam Toefy, said his supporters' communities were like prisons where people were forced to live behind bars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want tourists, we need them, we cannot do without their foreign currency. But why should they come and enjoy our seaside and mountains and have the run of the place when we cannot even have our children playing in the parks?&quot; Toefy asked. A Pagad leader known only as &quot;the Amir&quot; said the media had linked their campaign with the word &quot;jihad&quot; which was given a negative connotation. &quot;When people use it they usually translate it into holy war. Nowhere in Islamic text, in the Arabic language, is this word translated as holy war,&quot; the Amir said. &quot;Its meaning is to exert oneself to the utmost.  Jihad is incumbent on Muslims at all times. When a student studies medicine, he has to exert himself to the utmost in his studies, that is a form of jihad.  &quot;When we take up a campaign against gangsterism and drugs, we are going to exert ourselves to the utmost. Jihad is not just a holy war by bloodthirsty people.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The National Party has proposed a range of perks and privileges it believes the leader of the opposition should be entitled to and the taxpayer should foot the bill for - ranging from unlimited air travel in South Africa and abroad for himself and his spouse to framed photographs and thank-you cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a 40-page submission to the Steyn Commission on the remuneration of public representatives, the NP says the leader of the opposition when he leaves office should get a &quot;life-long golden pass&quot; entitling him to unlimited business-class domestic flights on South African Airways (SAA), as well as a number of flights a year, also business class, for his spouse or widow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to a core staff of nine, offices and furniture, the NP wants Parliament to carry the costs for:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* hotel bills during official trips in South Africa and abroad, including those of accompanying family members;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* business-class tickets for his spouse even if she is travelling alone;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* money spent abroad on tips, drivers, newspapers and magazines;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* fax machines and cell phones at official residences as well as the costs of telephones for his private secretary and assistant private secretary;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* thank-you letters, Christmas and visiting cards;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the taking and framing of photographs and paintings &quot;for official purposes&quot;; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* invitations to official functions, including those hosted by the leader's spouse.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other perks the NP wants include South African Air Force travel for official duties; payment of relocation costs for family, domestic workers, household goods, pets and vehicles between Cape Town and Pretoria; payment for domestic workers who don't accompany the household to Cape Town to travel to their homes; and the travel costs of children between school or university if not in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic Party leader Tony Leon accused the NP of being &quot;obsessed with status and perks&quot;. &quot;The NP wasn't the slightest bit concerned about the position when they were in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Van Zyl Slabbert was leader of the opposition he earned a few hundred extra rands a month. Now the Nats want everything from state homes, secretaries to thank-you cards and flowers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document was &quot;the most meticulous and detailed piece of research to have come from the NP&quot;, he said. &quot;It is longer than their submission to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and more comprehensive than anything they presented during constitutional negotiations. &quot;The DP will certainly not be supporting these proposals.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Harold Williams was shot dead while carrying three dead chickens to his squatter home near Durbanville, outside Cape Town. The chickens had been dumped by nearby chicken factories and were due to be burned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams, the father of two children aged 16 and 13, was shot as a trespasser while walking home across private farm land.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like other squatters he often supplemented his family's diet with chicken retrieved from the dump. Police have confirmed that the chickens carried by Williams had been thrown away and were not stolen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams's death last month occurred during a struggle between the people in the Zwelethu squatter camp who want to remain there and the local municipality and farmers who want them out. Three days before Williams was killed, the 200 families at Zwelethu were served eviction notices by the Tygerberg Municipality in terms of the Illegal Squatting Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most of the people who live here were retrenched at farms nearby like County Fair and others. They lose their homes on the farm when they lose their jobs and are forced to squat,&quot; said Zwelethu community leader Matanzima Mthwa. &quot;We had a meeting with the Cape Metropolitan Council (CMC) last year, which farmers attended as well. The farmers told us we had no right to live here because the black people's place is Khayelitsha and the farmers feared homeless people would steal their livestock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The CMC said they would try and get money for our accommodation, but warned this would take long. They told us not to erect structures until we hear from them. Because we had nowhere to go, we started erecting homes.&quot; Mthwa said shortly after they began building permanent structures, police arrested 12 people. A week later, police and council security guards returned and fired teargas at the squatters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 21, all the families were served with eviction notices and given two weeks to leave the settlement. The squatters marched to the municipal offices and burned the notices there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams's sister, Maria Adams, believes her brother's death is the latest salvo in the attempt to get rid of the squatters. &quot;What really hurts us is that he was killed for three chickens the farmers didn't want anymore. The chickens had been dumped and they're usually burned if the squatters don't get there first,&quot; Adams said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My brother was walking back across farm land when he was killed. He was trespassing, but the squatters usually use that field when they go and fetch dumped chickens. The woman who shot him hasn't been arrested yet. Is his life worth less than three chickens?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Legal Resources Centre is applying to the Cape Town Supreme Court for an interdict to halt the eviction of the squatters, on the grounds that the matter should be referred to the Constitutional Court. The Tygerberg Municipality has undertaken to halt the eviction for two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police spokesman Inspector Veirna Simon confirmed the woman who allegedly shot Williams had not yet been arrested. She said following negotiations between the woman, her attorneys and the chief prosecutor for Kuils River, the woman would appear in court next week. A charge of murder was being investigated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are signs that Cabinet will meet in the next few weeks to discuss the burgeoning controversy around the issue - and the joint SPU/SDU move is bound to increase pressure on President Nelson Mandela and the Cabinet to consider changing the amnesty law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials from Simunye - an organisation promoting co-operation among members of the paramilitary units who were once arch enemies in townships east of Johannesburg (Katorus, Katlehong, Thokoza and Vosloorus) - this week told the Mail &amp; Guardian that members of their rank-and-file were disgruntled because the current cut-off date prevented its members from applying for amnesty.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela and Justice Minister Dullah Omar have responded to requests mainly from right-wing organisations whose members carried out bomb attacks on civilians before the 1994 elections by saying they do not favour extending the date. They will now have to consider requests from the other end of the political spectrum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Truth commission legislation allows people who committed politically motivated crimes before the middle of December 1993 to apply for amnesty from the truth body, thus excluding people who participated in political violence during the immediate run- up to the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former SPU commander Wiseman Ndebele, now secretary for Simunye, said his members were unhappy because it appears they do not qualify for amnesty even though their violent street battles around election time were politically motivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The amnesty date has to be extended because it affects us severely,&quot; added Thabo Kwaza, former SDU commander and an organiser for Simunye. &quot;If this is not agreed it may well cause a distrust of the truth commission in our ranks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that many SDU members were afraid that without amnesty they could be prosecuted for violent acts committed during the civil war fought between the rival militias in Thokoza and surrounding townships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 2 000 people were killed in this area during a two-year period before the election. Simunye members, who asked not to be named, said militia fighters would be tempted to join renegade units that still run crime rings in the townships if they are not given the opportunity to obtain amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we do not get the chance to apply for amnesty, it will add to a feeling that there is no protection whatsoever for people who want to come forward and tell the truth about what they did,&quot; said Kwaza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members said the organisation's members were also concerned about the efficiency of the commission's witness protection programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A (human rights violation committee) hearing of the truth commission will be held in Thokoza soon. But this is still a place of conflict and there are no-go zones. It may happen that someone gives public evidence to the commission and then something happens to that person. We need to be sure that witnesses and their families will be protected,&quot; said a former commander.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patrick Kelly, regional manager for the Gauteng office of the truth commission, said it was likely the issue of extending the cut-off date would be discussed by cabinet in the next few weeks. &quot;The commission has applied for the cut-off date as well as the deadline (December this year) for submission of amnesty applications to be extended.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kelly added that public hearings of the human rights violation committee in Thokoza, due to have been held in early December, had been postponed to January next year because the organisation wanted time to ensure that the hearing in this &quot;important political flashpoint&quot; was properly organised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the commission had a limited witness protection programme and worked closely with the police during commission hearings. There had been no serious attacks on people who gave evidence to the commission during other public hearings at flashpoint venues - but the organisation could not provide cast-iron guarantees that this would not happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duma Nkosi, ANC parliamentarian from Thokoza, said his organisation is standing firm on the date because it did not want to create the impression that people could carry out violent acts and then push for the amnesty rules to accommodate them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it was important to balance community sentiments in the Katorus area against wider national interests, including the fact that extending the cut-off date would allow the killers of communist party leader Chris Hani to apply for amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the ANC branch in Katorus will discuss the issue and if it emerges that there is support from significant sections of these communities for this date to be changed then we will take it up with the national leadership,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thabani Dlamini, member of the provincial council of the IFP in Gauteng, said his organisation would give &quot;full support&quot; to Simunye's requests. If these were heeded, it would encourage Inkatha members to appear at various truth commission hearings, he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Accused serial killer Moses Sithole had set up an organisation to campaign against the abuse of women and children, the Pretoria Supreme Court was told this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man alleged to have slain 37 women and a toddler set himself up as a champion of the oppressed, using &quot;official-looking&quot; letters typed by a former work colleague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between May and August last year, only months before his arrest, Sithole asked Melody Stern, a typist at Afrox in Pretoria West, where he was a casual worker washing trucks, to type the documents.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stern told the court that Sithole said he was starting the organisation in Atteridgeville. &quot;He asked me to type forms which people could fill out at schools ... teachers or any person who knew about people who were abused,&quot; she said. She also typed membership recruitment forms and minutes of meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stern said the organisation's name resembled that of the police's child protection unit. When she pointed this out Sithole changed it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The husband of one of the murdered women said that a few days after her body was discovered he found an envelope in her belongings with the name &quot; Child Protection Community Organisation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A street address in Pretoria as well as the time and date of an appointment were written on the envelope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Lepule, a taxi driver, said Mildred, his wife of eight years and mother of their two children, was promised a clerical job with promotion to a social worker in three years by a man she called Pheri. She was to be interviewed on June 1 last year by a &quot;Professor Williams&quot;. Three days before this she received a call from Pheri who was &quot;setting up the interview&quot; with Williams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A jubilant Mildred told her husband that the interview had been brought forward by a day. Lepule next saw his wife a month later - in a mortuary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state spent this week seeking to prove that the murders were committed by the same person - in similar circumstances with the promise of a job, rape and then strangling them with their underwear or an item of their clothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their bodies were found in open fields with identification documents destroyed or hidden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One witness after the other told how their loved ones left home one morning - to get a job they had been promised - never to be seen alive again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A half-full court of relatives and friends of the victims occasionally murmured or shouted at Sithole who seldom raised his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he sat up and stared at witnesses during the testimony about the organisation against women and child abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A witness who reported one of the murders said he saw a man, whom he could not identify, and a woman trespassing in a field in Boksburg North. Absalom Sangweni said he warned the couple not to walk in the field but they ignored him. Some minutes later the man returned - looking in different directions and putting a &quot;shiny object&quot; into his trousers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Sangweni went to investigate he found the woman, Josephine Mlangeni (25), strangled with a piece of her clothing and without underwear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transvaal deputy attorney general Retha Meintjies is leading the prosecution which has gathered 350 witnesses in the bloodiest serial killing trial in South Africa's history.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A Johannesburg businessman who fled from his R205-million marathon fraud trial to Australia could become the second alleged foreign exchange fraudster this month to be reeled in from exile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Edward Dutton (38), former managing director of hardboard company Interboard, will appear in court in Sydney on November 18 to fight a South African extradition application after spending this year in jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His hearing will come only two weeks after a London court ordered the extradition of Oliver Hill who faces forex fraud charges worth about R100- million in South Africa. Both Hill - and Dutton, if the court rules against him - could postpone or avoid their return home by appealing to higher courts in their countries of exile.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February 1994, in the middle of his marathon fraud trial in the Rand Supreme Court, Dutton jumped bail and fled to Australia. Once in Sydney, Dutton changed his name to Michael Addison and, according to acquaintances, bought a house in one of the city's swankiest suburbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dutton's exile was disturbed in November 1995 when South African officials lodged an application for his extradition. He was then arrested and twice succeeded in having his hearing postponed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James de Villiers, prosecuting counsel in the case, , says Dutton has apparently missed the deadline given him to file a written reply to the extradition application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rumour has it that one of Dutton's likely defences will be that the crimes for which he is wanted in South Africa are only connected with exchange control regulations, the breach of which is not an extraditable offence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Dutton fled, his trial had been running for almost two years and had cost the state R8,4-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood officials from the South African Reserve Bank and the OSEO who are handling the case are quietly confident the Sydney Court will order his extradition. If it does, Dutton, like Hill, will have to decide whether to fight an expensive round of appeals while sitting in jail or face trial in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Villiers says if the South Africans succeed in bagging Dutton, the case will simply start up where it left off. However, this time the authorities will presumably be more wary of granting Dutton bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the trial, which cost the state R8,4-million, the prosecution claimed Dutton used forged invoices and contracts to obtain foreign currency from several banks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - As African leaders met in Nairobi this week to discuss the rapidly worsening crisis in the Great Lakes Region, South Africa's envoy, Welile Nhlapo, had to sit outside and wait.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit on Tuesday, attended by the presidents or prime ministers of Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, and by Organisation of African Unity secretary general Salim Salim, took an international lead by proposing a neutral peace force to give safe haven to an estimated million refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African call mirrored urgent discussions in Western capitals on the nature of an inevitable foreign intervention. Germany has called for an urgent session of the United Nations Security Council, which was expected to meet late this week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nhlapo's exclusion from the summit's main session, along with other &quot; observers&quot;, underscored South Africa's relatively passive role in Africa's latest crisis. Often pressed by Western powers to take a regional lead, South Africa was again standing on the sidelines, saying it would take its cue from others in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Aziz Pahad appeared to be aware of the pressure when he told a briefing in Pretoria: &quot;We are quite conscious that we are a very important country on the African continent and that we have a responsibility for the continent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said President Nelson Mandela was in constant contact with regional leaders, and that Deputy President Thabo Mbeki would discuss the crisis with leaders during his current European visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, as South African Institute of International Affairs chief Greg Mills pointed out, the one regional grouping directly affected by the crisis but yet to get involved in deliberations is the Southern African Development Community (SADC), currently chaired by Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think we're playing a leading role, and I don't think we're playing the role expected of the most prominent country in SADC and in the entire sub-Saharan Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mills said it was imperative for South Africa to become actively involved this time, as the &quot;Afro-pessimism&quot; that tended to result from African crises would affect South Africa as much as any other. South Africa also risked losing its &quot;African stature, irrespective of Mandela&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But opening the way to South Africa's possible greater involvement, Foreign Affairs announced this week that &quot;after high-level consultation with leaders in the Great Lakes region and reports of cross- border incursions by Rwandan armed forces&quot; the supply of South African arms to Rwanda was being suspended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coming less than six weeks after South Africa approved the sale of R87- million worth of light arms and armoured personnel carriers, it removes one of the main stumbling blocks to South Africa acting as a peace broker or contributing troops as it could help restore the country's image of neutrality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, leaked details from a still secret UN report, compiled by a commission looking into allegations of arms smuggling to the Great Lakes region, implicate South African citizens, along with nationals from a number of other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What remains to be seen is whether South Africa will take the final step of committing troops should the UN give the go- ahead for a multinational intervention. Mandela previously made it clear he would be wary of committing troops to African hotspots, because of the strains of transition on the South African National Defence Force (SANDF), and also because South Africa, seen as a regional bully in the apartheid era, could easily offend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Affairs liaison officer Marco Boni said there had now been a shift in the South African attitude, and although it was still felt there was a lack of military capacity, South Africa was more ready than earlier this year when it said it would not join a Burundi peace force. &quot;This is a different kettle of fish. We are definitely more aware and more prepared.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Judge President of South Africa's new Labour Court, Judge John Myburgh, has slammed the Judicial Services Commission (JSC) and has savaged the government for ineptitude in implementing the new Labour Relations Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accusing the JSC of treating a candidate for the bench like a &quot;skelm&quot; and ridiculing the Public Works Department - whose motto, he said, should be &quot;we do not serve; we sleep&quot; - the judge said the public service had failed the new Labour Court in every respect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing labour lawyers in Cape Town this week, Myburgh described his struggle to find a suitable venue for the seat of the Labour Court in Johannesburg as &quot;extremely painful&quot; and said between July and November nothing had been done to find a venue in Durban. A building had been found in Cape Town, but construction had come to a halt in early August for lack of a building contract between the builders and the government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have accused the Public Works Department of gross incompetence ... It's an open question as to whether they are incompetent or are being subversive,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myburgh said pamphlets explaining the workings of the new Labour Court which had been given to the government printers were not yet ready. Instead, Myburgh offered labour lawyers a photostat which he was distributing personally on an information tour around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myburgh's other complaints included a gripe that the government had taken 10 weeks to translate the rules of the court into Afrikaans. &quot;We thought the minister of justice had heard a fanfare when we had them ready on July 23. He didn't and it has taken until October 14 to have them published.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Myburgh also criticised the Labour Relations Act for making it so difficult to find suitable judges for the Labour Court and the Labour Appeal Court.  Disputes between the National Economic, Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) and the JSC, he said, had delayed appointments by 10 weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So it was not a disaster, but it was potentially a disaster ... the Act could not be implemented for 10 weeks, the candidates had to wait 10 weeks without knowing if they were to change their careers,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There appears to be no love lost between Myburgh and the JSC. He accused it of having ridden roughshod over Nedlac nominations for Labour Court judges and of being too adversarial in its approach to candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In one interview, the JSC interviewed a candidate as if he were a skelm and reduced him to tears. This was another problem. We are trying to meet with the new chief justice to discuss a modus vivendi for the JSC,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new Labour Court will serve alongside the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA), the lynchpin of the new Act which comes into effect on November 11. The CCMA, which will administer the mediation and arbitration of labour disputes, will be the first port of call for opposing parties, with the Labour Court there to serve opponents whose disputes cannot be solved through conciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CCMA, which will be headed by top mediator Charles Nupen, has also had some teething problems including a budget cut, but has had more luck setting up an infrastructure than the Labour Court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The new government's first privatisation deal - the successful sale of six SABC radio stations - took a severe blow this week when the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) conceded in court its decision on one of the sales was invalid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counsel representing the IBA, which is fighting claims by Naledi Media Investments that the authority's decision to sell Radio Jacaranda to a rival bidder was invalid, admitted the decision's invalidity just minutes after the Rand Supreme Court case had started. The reason, said Chris Loxton SC, was that only four of the five IBA councillors appointed at the time had presided over the decision - councillor William Lane, a lawyer, had been on holiday while the IBA had been making most of its landmark decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some media lawyers say that if the court ends up agreeing with the quorum concession, it could theoretically leave five of the six sales open to challenge as the IBA decided them without Lane. This would create the potential for havoc among the stations' new owners. Others say that of the other losers, only the &quot;odd chancer&quot; will seek to reopen other decisions, noting that nobody complained about the lack of a quorum at the time of the hearings themselves and that most of the decisions have been welcomed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from the status of the other sale decisions, commentators say the case, which is the first legal attack on the IBA, is crucial because any suggestion that the IBA acted improperly could provide ammunition to those in government keen to reduce its independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether or not the IBA did actually break the rules by taking the Radio Jacaranda decision without a quorum has yet to be decided by the court, the issue having been clouded by the drama that followed Judge Mahomed Navsa's favourable comments to Loxton on his rapid concession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Navsa's comments provided counsel Hiram Slomowitz, SC, who is representing rival winner Newshelf 71, the opportunity to demand the judge's recusal on the basis of the perception of bias. At the time of going to press the trial was proceeding with a new judge, P. Streicher. While Naledi is anxious for a new decision the New African Investments Limited-dominated Newshelf 71 is fighting for the decision to hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was not just the IBA's possible errors that were in the spotlight.  Before Navsa bowed out, he expressed amazement that government had failed for two years to appoint the three extra councillors the IBA needed to make up a full contingent of eight - if the extra councillors, who were appointed after the IBA's decisions on the six radio stations, had been in office Lane's decision to go on holiday would not have been as problematic. Commentators point out government's failure to act meant no councillor could be sick or on leave without rendering the council inoperative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naledi is also arguing that Nail's company should not have won in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In written argument filed with the court it says the winning company should have been disqualified because it had a foreign financial interest (from a French company) exceeding 20% - the IBA rules encourage the development of local players. It also argues the French company, Europe Development International (EDI), will effectively control the operation and that an IBA councillor had failed to disclose he had acquainted himself with EDI on a visit to France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The decision was arbitrary, capricious and demonstrates the persons who took the decision did not apply their minds in accordance with the requirements of the Act ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, the IBA denies in papers filed with the court that the French company had too high a stake in the winning operation. It said the consultancy services agreement struck between EDI and its South African partners did not boost its financial interest above the maximum 20% allowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also dismissed Naledi's suggestion that it had breached the rules regulating cross- media control by awarding the staion to the Nail-dominated operation. The IBA apparently granted an exemption from the rules because of the high competition in the Gauteng area. It also favoured the higher black ownership of the winner - 65% versus Naledi's 45% - and its access to the significant technical expertise of EDI.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Sebelitso Mokone-Matabane, the co-chair of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), tried to persuade the SABC to feature her in a television programme instead of her colleague John Matisonn, whom she said represented a &quot;small white constituency&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian learned this week of Mokone-Matabane's efforts to meddle with the public broadcaster over last Thursday night's Focus programme on the IBA. Her remarks about co-councillor Matisonn, who had been selected for the programme because of his wide experience in journalism and broadcasting, followed the SABC's initial reluctance to obey her and revamp its programme hours before going on air.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An internal report for SABC chief executive Zwelakhe Sisulu has been written on the episode, which was also discussed on Radio Metro's Bush Telegraph. Executive producer Vincent Mfundisi and Sarah Crowe, the head of SABC TV current affairs, wrote the report</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mokone-Matabane asked the programme's producers to feature her and said that if they failed to do so she would ask them to scrap prepared inserts in which she featured. She said in one heated conversation that Matisonn represented &quot;a small white constituency&quot;, according to the internal report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics have pointed out that IBA councillors are not elected, but were nominated by media and civil society interest groups. Mokone-Matabane hit out at some of the show's black producers, expressing disbelief that they, as blacks, could want Matisonn instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As deadline approached SABC staffers contacted Matisonn to ask whether he would mind the switch. Matisonn offered to withdraw and later said he was willing to appear in the programme at short notice when it emerged Mokone- Matabane would back down anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SABC contacted Matisonn who arrived at the studio about 10 minutes before the programme went on air. Matisonn in May let the parliamentary committee on broadcasting, post and telecommunications know that he will not be available for reappointment when his term of office expires in March 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood that Sisulu congratulated the programme's producers for sticking to their guns. SABC public relations general manager Enoch Sithole and SABC television head Joe Thloloe refused to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mokone-Matabane did not dispute the account except to reject the interpretation she had asked for Matisonn to be ditched. She said she had merely told the SABCshe failed to understand how they chose who should be on the programme. She was concerned about the tendency to interview her white male colleagues. She noted the SABChad interviewed co chair Peter de Klerk over the Radio Highveld hearings, although she had chaired them. &quot;My sense was that the SABCwas marginalising not only black councillors, but also black people.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Three prisoners awaiting trial for taxi violence escaped from prison near Durban on Sunday with inside help. The warders who allegedly helped the men get out of Westville Prison were also linked to the taxi industry, according to colleagues who, a month earlier, predicted the escape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Escapees Sandile Mpanza and Sydney Sithole, together with a warder and an unidentified man, died in a hail of bullets in a gun- battle with members of Durban's Murder and Robbery Unit near Inanda on Monday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Escaped prisoner Velaphi Madondo is still at large, and is believed to be hiding in Newcastle.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAPS KwaZulu-Natal spokesman Captain Bongani Nzimande said it appeared that the dead warder, Sipho Skhosana, had been driving the vehicle carrying the two escapees and the unidentified man when they opened fire on an approaching Murder and Robbery Unit vehicle. Nzimande said the unit approached the &quot; suspicious-looking vehicle&quot; and returned fire, killing three occupants and wounding Skhosana, who died later in hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two Police and Prison's Civil Rights Union (Popcru)-aligned prison warders who spoke to the Mail &amp; Guardian this week on condition of anonymity said the deaths, and the escape, could have been prevented if police investigators had heeded their warning that Mpanza - who had already escaped once this year - would attempt another escape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are a lot of cover-ups going on. We are trying to expose corruption at our workplace, but we are hitting brick walls,&quot; said the warders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The warders warned police investigators last month about Mpanza's escape potential in a 15-page dossier detailing alleged corruption among prison officials. Naming three of the four officials they accuse of assisting this week's escape in their submission related to Mpanza's previous escape, the warders said Mpanza's continued connection with a prison hospital official would pave the way for a second escape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KwaZulu-Natal Correctional Services spokesman Andy Anderson said Mpanza, Sithole and Madondo escaped on Sunday using a 9mm pistol in their possession.  A metallic-grey Jetta was waiting for them. He refused to speculate on whether prison officials had assisted the escape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Popcru warders said the three prisoners had been in and out of meetings with the prison officials in the office of one of them between Thursday and Sunday. Mpanza not only had a 9mm pistol, but also had the keys to the getaway car. After holding up the guard at reception, the prisoners went out the side entrance into the garage where they encountered the hospital official. They told him to move aside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was said to be taking another prisoner to the hospital, but there was no reason for him to be there because the normal procedure was to call an ambulance which was followed by a guard in a state vehicle, the warders alleged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The warders claimed the hospital official was a taxi owner with long- standing links to Mpanza and to the Inkatha Freedom Party: &quot;He kept Mpanza in the hospital section even though he wasn't sick. He keeps all the taxi and IFP-related prisoners there to provide easy access for IFP officials,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The warders said several IFP officials had visited prisoners there in the run-up to the July Truth and Reconciliation Commission Amnesty Committee hearings at the prison. While they claim IFP secretary general Ziba Jiyane and Correctional Services Minister Sipo Mzimela have both visited the prison once, they say &quot;the most regular visitor is former KwaZulu Police captain Langalakhe Hlengwa&quot;, who had attempted to persuade IFP members not to testify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hlengwa, a former member of the KwaZulu Bureau of Security and Intelligence (BSI), featured in the 1994 Transitional Executive Council report on hit- squads which alleged he had &quot;been implicated in attempts to conceal, secure the release of or pay certain (persons involved in hit-squads)&quot;, including the once feared hit man Jerry Mdanda, who died last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Popcru-aligned warders said the political atmosphere around the prison hospital was just the latest in a string of complaints involving the hospital official and several other prison officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The warders handed the dossier to national Special Investigations Unit Director Bushy Engelbrecht last month in an effort to force a probe into the prison hierarchy. Engelbrecht said he viewed the allegations as &quot;extremely serious&quot; and had handed the matter to his superiors who assigned the investigation to provincial police:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't know what has happened after that, except that I know the warders say they have become very frustrated with waiting for the investigation to get off the ground,&quot; he said. The warders say they were interviewed once by provincial police, but were told the investigation had been stopped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KwaZulu-Natal acting CID head Eric Nkabinde said he had received the dossier this Tuesday, after taking over from his superior who had gone on leave: &quot;I have appointed someone whom I trust to get to the bottom of this and I am waiting for a report from him,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Free State Premier Terror Lekota has been thrown a lifeline by the African National Congress national leadership's dramatic intervention in the faction-torn region - but to return as premier he will have to win a decisive victory at his party's provincial congress leadership elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision by the ANC's National Working Committee (NWC) - agreed to by all the players this week - that Lekota and his provincial executive stand down and that the 43 member provincial executive committee also resign in favour of a caretaker committee effectively defuses the power struggle between Lekota and a faction led by ANC Free State chair Pat Matosa. Their battle was threatening to paralyse the government in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the national ANC leadership has been criticised by opposition parties for meddling in provincial affairs, it clearly had little choice but to act in a situation where both sides conceded they had broken the terms of an agreement brokered by President Nelson Mandela earlier in a bid to resolve the impasse.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the NWC decision gives the crucial impression of a national leadership acting with an even hand, it in fact opens the way for Lekota's return to power as premier - this time with the vote of confidence he needs from party structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lekota's problem has been that while he commands popular support, chiefly in the southern part of the region, though also increasingly in the north as a result of his high-profile crusade against corruption, he has lacked control over the party machinery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deployed to the region by the national leadership, Lekota was seen by local ANC leaders as an outsider and a threat. In 1994 he lost the vote for leader of the ANC to Pat Matosa; subsequent bids by him to secure a place in the provincial executive failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While his rivals turned the party machinery against him, he also stands accused of using his position against his enemies - to the detriment of the ANC, the provincial government and the people of the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NWC's decision - to be ratified by the ANC's National Executive Committee (NEC) this weekend - helps Lekota in several ways. Disciplinary proceedings against him in the wake of comments he made attacking Free State ANC leaders on a radio broadcast have been halted, while investigations into allegations of fraud and corruption involving certain MECs will continue.  (Lekota is being sued for R300 000 damages by Godfrey Mayekiso, brother of sacked Housing MEC Vax Mayekiso, for allegedly defaming him during a radio broadcast.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An NWC task group will oversee an interim committee that will run the ANC in the province and prepare for the congress, which it is expected will be postponed from December until February. Special rules will be drawn up to help ensure the elections are substantially free and fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is hoped this will break the hold Lekota's rivals have on the party machinery. The expectations are that Lekota will be able to secure his election as provincial leader of the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will then be for congress delegates to decide whether or not the positions of party provincial chair and premier should be unified, as they are in most other ANC-held provinces. If so agreed, the caretaker premier would stand down in favour of Lekota who would then form a new executive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At national level people are trying to do what they can to help him while at the same time appearing to be even-handed,&quot; said a source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC membership in the region has plummeted, contrary to what one would expect in the run-up to a party conference. Lekota's supporters have accused the party leadership of withholding membership cards from new recruits so as to influence the outcome of the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC chair Jacob Zuma will lead a national leadership delegation to Welkom on Sunday to brief a Free State provincial general council meeting fully aware of the decision and its implications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting will be guided on who will be eligible for election to replace Lekota and members of his provincial executive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Lekota's supporters were this week optimistic Lekota would be able immediately to stand for the position, NWC sources told the Mail &amp; Guardian none of the players contaminated by the region's two-year power struggle would be eligible for the interim leadership positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The names of two national assembly MPs were this week being mooted as possible replacements for Lekota as caretaker premier. They are Sekhopi Malebo, who shares a United Democratic Front background with Lekota and was the first chairperson of the ANC in the Southern Free State region and Zingile Dingani, who took over from Gill Marcus as chair of Parliament's joint standing committee on finance, a former deputy chair of the southern Free State region. They would first have to become members of the provincial legislature but it is understood there are mechanisms to achieve this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was stressed, however, that a new premier and replacements for all or some of the 10 ANC members of Lekota's provincial executive would serve for an interim period only.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Key players were this week heeding an injunction by the NWC that they refrain from making press statements. Sources close to the Matosa faction were, however, insisting that Lekota was not as clean as he was projecting himself to be in his anti- corruption crusade.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - More heads than one will roll in the Eastern Cape, according to sources close to President Nelson Mandela. Premier Raymond Mhlaba has already been told that he is to be dismissed and once he steps down his cabinet and his two key civil servants - the director general of the Eastern Cape administration, Dr Thozamile Botha, and cabinet secretary Zam Titus - are also expected to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clean sweep will be in line with recommendations in a top-secret report on the Eastern Cape presented to Mandela and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki last week, in which they were advised that the administrative disaster besetting the province cannot be fixed until the political leadership is overhauled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the report does not identify personalities, its meaning is clear and it is ushering in one of the most painful chapters of African National Congress government - for the first time the party blames itself for weak leadership and poor management and is taking action against personalities it holds dear.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela is said to have broken the news to &quot;Oom Ray&quot; last Friday. The instructions are testing the friendship which dates back to their imprisonment together on Robben Island, particularly given the fact that Mhlaba is reluctant to go and that in his time he contributed enormously to the ANC's struggle against apartheid. It is said that Mbeki has been influential in his axing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not known if Botha or Titus have been officially informed of their fate. But since the public service director general, Dr Paseko Ncholo, took his crack team to Bisho to examine the problems, as reported by the Mail &amp; Guardian two weeks ago, the writing has been on the walls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As with Mhlaba, Botha and Titus made critical contributions to the struggle against apartheid and to the first round of constitutional negotiations.  Botha led the ANC through local government negotiations and Titus played a key role in the multi- party talks in Kempton Park as a legal drafter and representative of the ANC- supporting Transkei government. The ANC has much to thank them for and will probably find new jobs for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initial transparency about the report has, according to public service sources, been replaced by instructions that it not be given to anybody while the &quot;Cabinet at central government decides what the hell it can do about the problems in the Eastern Cape&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela's representative, Parks Mankahlana, has denied that the Cabinet discussed the Eastern Cape report this week, but senior officials have already confirmed that the ANC's treasurer general and chief whip, the Reverend Arnold Stofile, will be replacing Mhlaba. It is expected that Stofile will choose a new cabinet early next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mhlaba's authority is said to have slipped to such an extent that his cabinet ministers do not report back to him. MECs complain that they cannot control public servants, particularly those employed since 1994 as political appointments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ncholo's report also suggests curing problems by restructuring the Eastern Cape administration. It describes new organograms for the premier's and director general's offices. Possible changes include the linking of finances to projects, proper budgeting, setting goals for departments and training civil servants to do their jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Head of the University of the Witwatersrand School of Public Administration, Mark Swilling, said that one of the province's main problems was that &quot;it is a morass of competing policies and with a totally weak premier&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swilling said the pity was that the civil servants from the chief director level down were by far the most capable group of civil servants in the country, but their natural skills were being wasted by poor political management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, former ANC MP and Transkei's last military dictator, Bantu Holomisa, defended Mhlaba this week, saying that it was unfair to turf him out before his five years were up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC MPs in central government fear that the political overhaul in the Eastern Cape will provide rich pickings for the dissident Holomisa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa put such fears temporarily to rest this week, saying: &quot;I'm through with homeland and regional politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warned, however, that the Eastern Cape would be a &quot;political nightmare&quot; for the next five to 10 years unless the ANC acted fast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem is not Mhlaba, but a lack of policy from central government and a lack of advice as to how provinces should operate,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources say that the Eastern Cape Provincial Service Commission appealed for help early last year but was rejected by the National Public Service Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Ncholo is setting off for a similar inquiry into the Northern Province administration. He refused to discuss the report, saying only: &quot;The Eastern Cape has opened our eyes ...&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Seven of the eight charges brought against the South African Broadcasting Corporation's (SABC) general manager of television programme policy, planning and co-production, Melanie Chait, have been dropped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, an SABC spokesman said Chait had received a written warning in connection with the eighth charge, which was &quot;insubordination&quot;, and was upheld.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chait was taken before a disciplinary hearing by television head Jill Chisholm two weeks ago, for staying in London three days longer than anticipated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it is believed that Chisholm signed for Chait's five days leave although she initially wanted her to take only two days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charge of &quot;insubordination&quot; is apparently pegged to Chait's disagreement with Chisholm over these days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to insiders, Chait was on SABC business in London in a bid to forge relations with British producers, among other things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An SABC spokesman said Chait is appealing against the charge because she believes it would not have been possible to achieve what she had to in only two days abroad. &quot;It seems like everything except sexual harassment was thrown at Melanie,&quot; said one insider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also emerged that Chait was not approached and the allegations were not discussed prior to her appearing before the disciplinary hearing - which is not in line with the recommended labour relations procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Requests by Chait and her lawyers to have the disciplinary hearing panel members changed were denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Precedent at the SABC dictates that &quot;equals or seniors&quot; preside over disciplinary hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Chait's instance, there were some juniors presiding over the hearing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Paul Ekon, the flamboyant young millionaire who claims African National Congress leaders as friends, is being investigated by police for his possible involvement in a gold- smuggling racket which a Supreme Court affidavit says lost South Africa a quarter of a billion rands in a single year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi, replying to a question in Parliament from Democratic Party Member of Parliament Douglas Gibson on Wednesday, effectively confirmed Ekon was being investigated for the &quot;illegal possession of unwrought gold&quot; worth R4,8-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was a reference to a raid at Johannesburg International Airport in June last year, when police seized 129kg of gold. Police connected that consignment in a subsequent Rand Supreme Court battle to a syndicate which they said had smuggled more than five tons of gold to Europe and Britain in the preceding year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The total value of the 49 consignments which police documented in an affidavit was about US$52-million - more than R240-million at current value.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The affidavit was part of Mufamadi's defence, as Minister of Safety and Security, against Deon Kruger, pilot of the aircraft on which the gold was found. Kruger sued Mufamadi and the police for the return of the gold, but his case failed and he turned state witness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking from London this week Ekon (37), denied his involvement, saying he found the charge &quot;unbelievable&quot; and that Mufamadi &quot;has a lot to answer for now&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ekon's links to leaders in the ANC first became apparent in August when axed deputy minister Bantu Holomisa dragged him into his war of words with the party. Holomisa claimed casino magnate Sol Kerzner had funded Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's 50th birthday party in 1992, and that Ekon had been the &quot;middleman&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ekon, at whose Houghton, Johannesburg mansion the party was held, claimed in response that he, clothing industrialist Charles Priebatsch and &quot; ANC tailor&quot; Yusuf Surtee - both also close to ANC leaders - had solely funded the bash. Mbeki later confirmed this version, saying it had been a surprise party and that he had not been involved in the arrangements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian has established that Ekon had extensive contact with top ANC leaders after the organisation was unbanned in 1990, and that this continued at least until he resettled in London in late 1994 or early 1995.  The latest known contact was when Ekon was a guest at a function in honour of President Nelson Mandela during his state visit to London in July this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier social contacts included Ekon's presence as a prominent guest at late ANC leader Oliver Tambo's funeral, his attendance at a cocktail party for singer Paul Simon hosted by Mandela, and Mandela's attendance at Ekon's wedding about three years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insiders say he acted as a &quot;fixer&quot; for the ANC's Department of International Affairs, which Mbeki headed before the elections, and probably for other ANC departments. Said one: &quot;If they wanted to go to Zambia tonight, he'd organise it, because he had the contacts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other favours before the elections, Ekon is also known to have provided cellular phones to ANC officials in the party's Shell House headquarters, and to have handed out handguns to a number of them. The gift of guns, according to one former acquaintance of Ekon's, brought him into conflict with Mpumalanga Premier Mathews Phosa, then head of the ANC legal department in Shell House. Phosa would not take a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ekon was involved in an attempt to set up a Swedish-backed television station in South Africa - in which Dali Tambo, son of Oliver Tambo, would have played a leading role - and other failed foreign-backed &quot;black empowerment&quot;deals. Ekon has said that the Women's Development Bank, headed at the time by Mbeki's wife, Zanele, would have been a partner in one of these - the importation of a factory to produce cheap houses - while others would have empowered former ANC political prisoners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A partner in one of these deals said Ekon did not hesitate to try and use his political contacts: &quot;He'd take us to Shell House, and he just entered like it was his house ... He'd walk into any office - Cyril Ramaphosa or anybody at any level.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ekon also played a role in trying to bring the ANC together with Kerzner, who may still face charges for his alleged gambling rights bribery in the former Transkei.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ekon tried in about 1992 to set up a meeting between Kerzner and Holomisa, then still military leader of the Transkei. Holomisa has confirmed Ekon's attempt to set up a meeting, but told M&amp;G he refused to meet him - suggesting instead that Kerzner send his lawyers to the attorney general in Umtata.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This course was later also recommended to Kerzner by Mandela and Mbeki at a meeting before the 1994 elections. Holomisa has claimed that Kerzner, who contributed to a R2-million election donation to the ANC at the time, had wanted the ANC to prevent his prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa has told M&amp;G that Ekon himself has boasted to have &quot;financially helped the organisation&quot;. Ekon earlier told M&amp;G he could not understand the acrimony between Holomisa and Mbeki over the Kerzner affair: &quot;Sol, Holomisa and Thabo are all good buddies of mine ... I tried to broker something ... I told Holomisa, 'Don't hound the guy (Kerzner), he's your biggest source of income.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To what extent Kerzner and Ekon are still friends is not clear. Ekon dated Kerzner's ex-wife Anneline Kriel in the early 1990s, which is said to have angered Kerzner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from his contacts with Mandela and Mbeki, Ekon is said to have &quot; socialised&quot; with ANC national chairman Jacob Zuma and Winnie Madikizela- Mandela. But how much influence he had is a matter for debate. A former Shell House employee said the ANC was dependent on benefactors in the pre-election period. &quot;He wasn't really their friend. He was like a groupie. He gave people things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Mandela's spokesman Parks Mankahlana: &quot;It is very difficult for anyone who's in a position of responsibility to chase people away from them ... Many people come to them and they have to listen to them, rich or poor, dubious or straightforward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said neither Mandela nor Mbeki would &quot;chase (anyone) away from them&quot; until they had been proved to be involved in untoward activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside his political contacts, Ekon had a strange mixture of friends and associates. He was friends with the likes of later convicted fraudster Greg Blank, with Liberty Life chief Donny Gordon's son Jeremy Gordon, and with Clive Beck, son of multi- millionaire Graham Beck. His lawyers include Ishmail Ayob, who is a friend of top ANC leaders, and Kobus du Plessis of law firm David H Botha, Du Plessis &amp; Kruger, which is perhaps best known for its legal work for former Civil Co-operation Bureau (CCB) operatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mpumalanga farmer Willie Lotter appeared in court in September on charges relating to the same June 1995 gold raid, he was represented by Du Plessis and Klaus von Lieres, the former Witwatersrand attorney- general who represented some of the accused in the recent Malan trial shortly after taking early retirement for &quot;ill-health&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ekon has acknowledged to M&amp;G that he is a friend of Lotter's, who M&amp;G understands to have done undercover work for the previous government. At his September court appearance, charges were provisionally withdrawn against Lotter - pending a court case in Switzerland, from where police are trying to obtain sensitive documentation. (Mufamadi said in his parliamentary answer on Wednesday that the investigation against Ekon depended on Swiss documentation.  )</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acquaintances of Ekon have also confirmed that his path has crossed with convicted murderer and former CCB agent Ferdi Barnard and Barnard's one-time friend, military intelligence agent Eugene Reilly, who died under mysterious circumstances after he allegedly warned of Chris Hani's impending assassination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their names have both been mentioned in connection with a shooting incident at Ekon's house in about 1992 which police connected at the time to a number of attacks on members of the Transvaal horseracing fraternity, in which Ekon was active. Ekon has acknowledged peripheral contact with Reilly, but denied contact with Barnard.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Following is a transcript of questions and answers at the Pentagon's daily briefing by Captain Michael Doubleday on November 7, on the subject of sending U.S. troops to assist with the refugee crisis in Eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Do you have any guidance on what sort of warning orders are going out for American forces to participate in Central Africa in various contingencies?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: I think everyone has some appreciation for how the military works. You might imagine any time there is a situation any place in the world, there is a lot of prudent planning that goes on. I would say that at this point that's exactly what we have -- people at the European Command doing the kinds of planning -- evaluating. They're doing that kind of thing that would enable the policymakers to see what the options might be and to see whether they want to pursue any one of the courses of action that the European planners might develop. But at this point, I would characterize that as just kind of the first level of planning and estimating what goes on in any kind of a situation like this.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: I take it from that response you're not prepared to talk about the range of things that they are working on at this point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: That's correct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Were you talking about unilateral, or any such move to be part of a multilateral?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: At this point I'm not specifying. You know that the military people try and get an early start on these so that they can look at a full range of options. At this point, we're still looking at some diplomatic initiatives that I think you're aware of that are going on. Since no decisions have been made, I don't think that it's appropriate to kind of outrun and forecast what might occur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Perhaps you can describe for us the type of military team that is either being sent there or is already there?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: I'm not aware of a military team that has been there. Nor am I aware of any kind of a military team that is planned to go there. I do know that there has been a military participant in the meeting that occurred in Geneva yesterday, but I'm not aware of any kind of a deployment that has occurred.  But that is not to say that that sort of thing could not be done without us being aware of it, since if it were done by the theater commander, he wouldn't necessarily have to check with us before he did it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Yesterday, the State Department spokesman basically ruled out sending ground troops. He said there are a number of proposals under consideration, but we're not talking about ground troop units here. Those were his words. Is that your understanding of this as well?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: I think there is that general feeling. But again, the kind of estimating and planning that goes on is, as I say, underway, but there have been no decisions made at all at this point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Is there a timetable for decisions?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: I don't even know of a timetable. I think there's some urgency attached with the situation, given the current situation of the refugees down there.  They're out of their camps; the camps they were in initially. I know that the humanitarian organizations are working to try and reach those groups and do the best they can to feed and provide medical attention where necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: This is not a war situation, a war contingency. The thought process that is going in to try to assess these options is not classified or anything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: That's correct. It's not classified. As far as I know. I think there's probably a little bit of a concern any time you do one of these things as to possible security consequences given the fact that not everybody may be interested in having the kind of help that may ultimately be provided, so that kind of thing might happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Can you talk about sort of the range of contingencies, since it's not classified, it's a humanitarian operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: I think at some point it might be appropriate to talk about ranges, but at this point, first of all, I don't think ranges have been developed; and secondly, I think it's premature to do that since there really haven't been any decisions made yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q: Yesterday was the day the NATO Military Committee was scheduled to present its analysis of the options under consideration. Apparently there was a bit of a snag in that consideration process. NATO sources now say it may be next week before they take those up. Can you tell us about, at all, what some of the American objections were to the analysis and why things are...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: No, I can't. I do know that the North Atlantic Council was briefed yesterday on the status. The NAC did not immediately take action on them, and the Military Committee is continuing its work. I don't have any details for you on any of the discussions that went on during that meeting, which as I understand it, took place in Brussels.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations - Report on remarks by Sylvana Foa, Spokesman for the Secretary General, at the daily briefing on November 7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With respect to Western Sahara and the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO), Ms. Foa said the Secretary-General had submitted his latest report on that issue to the Security Council. In it, he says the positions of the Government of Morocco and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia el-Hamra and Rio de Oro (POLISARIO) regarding further identification of individuals for the proposed referendum remained irreconcilable.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, the Government of Morocco and POLISARIO had repeated their commitment to the settlement plan, she continued. They continued to respect the cease-fire and were hopeful that ways might be found to permit resumption of the identification process and full implementation of the plan. The Secretary-General also said that the release of 66 POLISARIO prisoners-of-war on 31 October by the Government of Morocco had been particularly welcomed and should help promote confidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In view of the recent indications that the parties are moving forward, and in order to allow time for further progress, the Secretary-General recommends that the Security Council extend MINURSO's mandate for a further period of six months, till 31 May 1997, while making it clear that the international community cannot be expected to support the extension of the mandate indefinitely unless there was tangible progress towards the settlement of the question of Western Sahara&quot;, Ms. Foa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current mandate of MINURSO was due to expire on 30 November, she said. &quot; As you know, we have considerably downsized that mission. Out of, for instance, the authorized 410 posts for the identification process, 240 have been withdrawn. We only have 170 people on the ground. There has also been a reduction in the civilian police component, from 91 officers to nine.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Secretary-General's Special Envoy to the Great Lakes Region, Ambassador Raymond Chretien (Canada), met with Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko in Nice, France, and then flew on to Nairobi, Ms. Foa said. From there, he would catch a flight to Kigali, thus, changing his original plan of going straight to Kinshasa. Mr. Chretien's talks with President Mobutu had been &quot;very, very positive&quot;, she said, adding that President Mobutu said he would do everything possible to maintain this period of calm, so the multinational force discussed in Nairobi might be able to help get food to the refugees rapidly and help them return to their home countries. &quot;So, that meeting was extremely positive.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports from the field in eastern Zaire were &quot;not that positive&quot;, Ms. Foa went on to say. Noting &quot;about 2,115 refugees out of the total of 1.1 million Rwandan refugees have gone back to Rwanda&quot;, she said Rwandan refugees arriving in Rwanda had reported that the refugees who abandoned the camps of Katale and Kahindo, near Goma, were beginning to die from lack of food and water. &quot;They are telling us also that one of the reasons that they have come back to Rwanda is that things are so bad out in the jungle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said reports had confirmed that about 27,000 Burundi refugees out of the 145,000 in eastern Zaire were now back in Burundi. Of those, around 11, 000 were in the Bujumbura area, with another 16,000 in the Cibitoke region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the non-governmental organizations got into Goma yesterday (Wednesday)&quot;, Ms. Foa told correspondents. &quot;They said that thousands of refugees were in Goma, searching for food. The hospital was full of the war- wounded, and there are no medical supplies. We are getting reports that there is a stench of decaying bodies, both in Goma and in the region between Uvira and the Burundi border. They say that Uvira is now in the control of fighters, some of them barely 12 years old, who are armed with Kalashnikovs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Bukavu, we're getting reports that looting is continuing&quot;, Ms. Foa said.  &quot;Expatriates were being allowed to leave, but they're being asked to leave all their belongings behind. Expatriates in Goma are also being told that they could leave, but they also have to leave all their possessions behind, including their shoes and socks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We also have reports of fighting near Mugunga camp, where we believe there are still about 200,000 refugees left, out of the 400,000 that were in the Mugunga-Lac Vert area&quot;, Ms. Foa went on to say. &quot;We have reports that explosions ripped through Sake, wounding about 30 people. Many of the refugees from Mugunga seemed to be moving west towards Sake, a town about five kilometres west of Mugunga. There were also reports of fighting in southern Kivu province, around Fizi, but nothing very firm yet. This was from Zairian refugees arriving in the Tanzanian town of Kigoma.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In numbers: 27,000 Burundians were back in Burundi; 13,561 refugees, mostly Zairian refugees, were in southern Uganda; about 2,115 Rwandan refugees had returned to Rwanda, plus 4,500 Zairian refugees&quot;, Ms. Foa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Tanzania, the number of refugees is now about 8,500. The airport of Bukavu, according to reports, as well as the road from Bukavu to Goma, appeared to be mined, so we are being warned to be very careful.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Heavy artillery fire west of Goma town has been reported by AFP this afternoon, with the road to Mugunga closed to civilians. Fighting started last night, with gunfire heard about 15 to 20 kilometres from the town. A rebel official was quoted as saying armed Hutu extremists were &quot; holding out&quot; and trying to attack Goma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This follows reports yesterday of rebels preparing an offensive against Mugunga camp. Reuters reported yesterday that armed Hutu extremists had seized more than a hundred Zairean children from a nearby village this week, and were holding them hostage at Mugunga camp to deter a rebel attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New fighting marks the end of a tenuous three week ceasefire unilaterally declared on November 4 (Monday) by the rebels. Rebels claimed to AFP however that the ceasefire still holds, as they were simply defending Goma against attacks from Mugunga.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new site of conflict emerged today in Nyakunde, 50 kilometres southwest of Bunia, on the Ugandan border. Mission Aviation Fellowship (MAF) have been evacuating aid workers today, and 300 Zairean refugees have crossed the border to Kasese as a result of the fighting. Zairean soldiers are reportedly regrouping in Bunia. This new site of rebellion is more than 250 kilometres north of the strip of border territory known to be held by the AFDL rebels.  Aid workers say they need to clarify whether fighters are from a different group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (AFDL) have been protesting that their movement is &quot;misunderstood&quot; by the international community, who describe it as a &quot;Tutsi-led&quot; rebellion.  According to the ADFL, it comprises different political and ethnic groups fighting to overthrow President Mobutu. Yesterday AFDL spokesman Laurent Kabila, in Bukavu, was reported by AFP as urging crowds to join the movement, saying young people would recieve weapons &quot;as soon as tomorrow&quot;. The rebels were also reported as attempting to set up an administration in the three main towns they occupy, and appointing &quot;political commissars&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday saw the third demonstration in a week in Kinshasa against prime minister Kengo wa Dondo. Thousands of protesters occupied the main parliament, despite a ban on demonstrations, and accused Kengo of &quot;high treason&quot;, associating his part-Tutsi background with the rebellion in eastern Zaire.  Troops did little to restrain protesters; Zaire's army chief of staff General Eluki Monga Aundu publicly protested against the government's handling of the crisis last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State-run Kenyan Broadcasting Corporation (KBC) said yesterday that President Moi had recieved an apology by Kengo wa Dondo, who said he could not attend regional talks on Tuesday because he was prevented by a parliamentary resolution demanding that all foreign troops withdraw from Zairean territory before any participation in talks. This was a reference to Rwandan troops, which journalists continue to report as present in rebel-held eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A British and French summit today discusses planned intervention. British Prime Minister John Major was quoted on BBC World Service saying that military intervention and the contribution of British troops was &quot;a possibility&quot;, but he said it was important to have consent from people in the region. He also said the force should have a large contingent of African troops. Britain has been described as acting as a brake on French enthusiasm to intervene, and there is division among member states over the use of Chapter VII - which allows intervention without consent of the parties involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BBC World Service talked of the difficulty of getting consensus for intervention from actors involved when there appeared to be &quot;no organised government&quot; in the area of conflict. The BBC also ran reports from Goma describing hungry local residents being beaten back by rebels as they tried to seize food in town warehouses. Concern focuses on the situation beyond the town, with new reports of dying refugees trapped behind the front line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Committee of the Red Cross called today for armed intervention. Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu today said Rwanda was opposed to French, Belgian and Rwandan participation in the intervention force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three Special Rapporteurs of the UN Human Rights Commission for Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire have expressed concern for the fate of Burundian refugees trying to return home from eastern Zaire. There have been reports of hundreds of people being killed while trying to return to their villages via the Gatumba transit point. In a statement issued in Geneva, the rapporteurs expressed concern that rebels in eastern Zaire and the Burundian army were conspiring to allow only women and children into the Gatumba transit camp, in an effort to push the men into Burundi's interior. Burundian refugees are primarily Hutus, and the refugee camps were regarded as bases for rebellion within Burundi. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Jose Ayala Lasso, said he was concerned that no human rights groups or humanitarian agencies were authorised to enter the &quot;no man's land&quot; transit zone to monitor the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No new returnees have been reported arriving at Gatumba over the last three days, and the total of arrivals remains 11,000. WFP reported about 3,000 arriving north of Gatumba yesterday, with a further 500 arriving today.  Returnees are being moved back to home communes, even in insecure provinces such as Cibitoke. An assessment mission to northwestern Burundi by UN agencies and NGOs today confirmed the arrival of at least 15,000 returnees in addition to the arrivals at Gatumba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Burundi government denied on Wednesday it was responsible for killings on the border. Refugees, aid workers, diplomats and human rights organisations say bodies washed up on the shores of the lake is evidence of the killings; but the Burundian government say the bodies are a result of anarchy in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New figures on refugee movements are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TANZANIA - there are now 10,080 registered refugees, with a futher 3,000 at the port - most of whom are said to be Zairean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UGANDA - new arrival points: Butagota 2,761, Ruenchane 500 (Zairean), Kisesi 300.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN DHA figures on UN humanitarian assistance to the Great Lakes reveal that $555 million has been made available for UN emergency operations in 1996 so far, which is approximately 80% of needs estimated before the new crisis. USA and the European Union are the largest contributors, providing 33% ($187m) and 14% ($79m) respectively. Church World Service issued a US$500,000 appeal yesterday, for &quot;massive relief programs in new camps&quot; in Zaire, including the resumpion of medical operations. Immediate needs are listed as distribution of medecines and medical services, food, clothing, health and sanitation kits, blankets and related shelter items, kitchen utensils and agricultural tools.  The appeal says refugees are emphatic they would &quot;rather die in Zaire than in Rwanda&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN Special Mediator Ambassador Raymond Chretien flew into Kigali today and held a meeting this afternoon with Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu. The newly appointed UN Humanitarian Coordinator for the Great Lakes, Sergio Vieira de Mello also attended. The officials, along with were Deputy Coordinator Martin Griffiths, held meetings with the donor community, UN agencies and the heads of NGOs. Four top officials from the European Union plan to visit the Great Lakes region tomorrow (Saturday) - European Commissioner Emma Bonino will travel with representatives from Ireland, Italy and Netherlands.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Zaire - Complex Emergency - Fact Sheet No. 1, FY 1997, U.S.  AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, BUREAU FOR HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE (BHR, OFFICE OF U.S. FOREIGN DISASTER ASSISTANCE (OFDA), November 8, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BACKGROUND:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamulenge and the Banyarwanda people, who are Tutsi of Rwandan origin, settled in the Mulenge hills of South Kivu, Zaire and the Masisi region of North Kivu, Zaire more than 200 years ago. Sporadic ethnic violence in the Masisi region has occurred since 1959, but it again escalated in the fall of 1995 as members of the former Rwandan army (the ex-FAR) and the Hutu militia (the Interahamwe) targeted Banyarwanda Tutsi in an apparent attempt to create an area of Hutu control in the region. In September 1996, the situation in the Uvira region of South Kivu, Zaire began to resemble that in the Masisi region. A rural development organization which had lobbied for recognition of Banyamulenge nationality rights was banned in August 1996, and in September indigenous Zairians organized strikes against the Banyamulenge and attacks against their homes and property. On October 8, 1996, the South Kivu Deputy Governor declared that Banyamulenge residents were to leave the area within seven days or be treated as rebels. On October 14, fighting broke out between the Banyamulenge rebels and the Zairian Army (FAZ) near Runingo refugee camp. From October 14 to November 4, the two-pronged fighting spread, moving up the eastern border of Zaire from Uvira, South Kivu to Bukavu, as well as south from Rutshuru, North Kivu to Goma.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fighting displaced up to one million Rwandan and Burundian refugees and Zairians. On November 4, the Banyamulenge rebels declared a unilateral three-week ceasefire to allow refugees to return home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CURRENT HUMANITARIAN SITUATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOMA:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 26, Kibumba camp north of Goma was shelled. This caused the camp's 195,000 Rwandan refugees to move south to Mugunga camp, thereby increasing its population to an estimated 420,000 people. On October 29, CARE Australia and the Zairian Red Cross distributed World Food Programme (WFP) food to 350,000 refugees at Mugunga camp and 50,000 refugees at Lac Vert camp.  Roughly 10,000 displaced Zairians were also assisted in the distribution.  Zairian staff of WFP distributed remaining foodstocks to Kahindo camp's 115, 000 refugees and Katale camp's 210,000 refugees on October 28.  As fighting intensified and the rebels gained control of the Goma airport and region, refugees emptied from the Katale, Kahindo, and Lac Vert camps, and Zairians fled Goma town. All expatriate humanitarian relief workers were evacuated from Goma on November 2; therefore, the international community does not have a good sense of where the refugees and displaced are moving. Most reports indicate that there currently is movement west of Goma in search of water.  Members of the local population in Goma reported on November 7 that disease is rampant and people are dying in large numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUKAVU:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 30, as the fighting between the FAZ and the Banyamulenge rebels spread north from Uvira, 40,000 refugees from the southern Bukavu camps and 20,000 Zairians from Bukavu town fled the area, moving west and north. The Banyamulenge now control the town and its airport. The rebels reported on November 5 that the city is calm and that thousands of Zairian residents have been returning each day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UVIRA:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By October 29, 220,000 refugees had fled the fighting around the Uvira camps. The camps are reported to be completely empty and most have been burned. Up to 80,000 refugees are thought to have moved north, while 400,000 refugees and internally displaced Zairians are believed to have moved south toward Fizi, Zaire. Uvira town was looted widely. The Banyamulenge rebels control Uvira town, its airport, and the area between it and Bukavu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NUMBERS AFFECTED:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As all roads and airports into eastern Zaire are closed, the international community has lost contact with the refugees and internally displaced Zairians. Up to one million Rwandan and Burundian refugees and internally displaced Zairians have been affected by the fighting. Current estimates of refugee and repatriation flows are as follows: 7,000 (mainly Zairian) refugees have fled to Kigoma, Tanzania; 10,800 Burundian returnees have arrived at Gatumba, Burundi; 12,000 persons have crossed into Cibitoke, Burundi; 5,300 Zairian refugees have fled to Burundi; 10,600 Zairian and Rwandan refugees have crossed into Kisoro and Ishasha ports in Uganda; 5,158 Zairian and Burundian refugees and Rwandan returnees have crossed into Gisenyi and Cyangugu, Rwanda. The Congo and Zambia have received roughly 1, 000 refugees each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USG ASSISTANCE:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 26, USAID/BHR/OFDA deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to Kigali, Rwanda. The DART's primary mission is to assess the current situation, supply informational updates, and provide funding to non- governmental organizations, U.N. agencies, and international organizations for programs to assist with repatriation efforts and readiness in Rwanda. On November 7, 1996, U.S. Ambassador Robert Gribbin declared a disaster in Rwanda, noting that the refugee crisis in eastern Zaire poses a humanitarian emergency for Rwanda.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations - The former Mozambican Minister of Education, Graca Machel, on Friday launched the United Nations Report on the Impact of Armed Conflict on Children. The Report offers a stark and uncompromising analysis of the suffering of children caught up in some 30 wars raging around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1994, UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali appointed Ms. Machel as his Expert to undertake a study on the impact of armed conflict on children in response to a call from the General Assembly.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement on Friday, Ms. Machel said whatever the causes of modern-day brutality towards children, the time has come to call a halt. &quot;It is unforgivable that children are assaulted, violated, murdered, and yet our conscience is not revolted nor our sense of dignity challenged,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the recommendations contained in the report were practical and achievable. &quot;We simply need to have the will to make them happen. The alternative, to do nothing, is unthinkable. For the sake of future peace, we must invest in the protection of children today,&quot; Ms. Machel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report attacks the global complacency and cynicism which had allowed 2 million children to die in armed conflicts in the past decade, and three times as many to be seriously injured or permanently disabled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It calls for a global campaign to stop the recruitment of children under the age of 18 into armed forces and to ensure that all forces demobilise those under 18 years of age immediately. The report urges all countries to support the speedy adoption of the draft optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, raising the minimum age of recruitment and participation in the armed forces to 18 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report calls for the appointment of a Special Representative of the Secretary-General to monitor progress on the recommendations and to keep the whole issue high on the international agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If its recommendations are adopted by the Member States, the Report would form the framework for future action to safeguard children caught up in conflicts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations - The following statement was issued today by the Spokesman for Secretary- General Boutros Boutros-Ghali:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Secretary-General has been profoundly disturbed and gravely concerned at the most serious humanitarian situation that has been evolving in eastern Zaire for the past few weeks. He wrote three letters to the President of the Security Council, on 14, 24 and 29 October, drawing the attention of the members of the Security Council to these alarming developments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 30 October, the Secretary-General appointed a Special Envoy to the Great Lakes Region, who is today in the region in an effort to establish the facts relating to the conflicts and develop urgent plans for defusing the tension and achieving a cease-fire, in order to allow for the negotiation process to begin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 6 November, the Secretary-General appointed a United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator for the Great Lakes Region, who is already in the region and will join the Special Envoy. The Secretary-General has also been in constant touch with the leaders of the region. He telephoned and wrote letters to the Presidents of Zaire, Uganda, Kenya, the United Republic of Tanzania, Cameroon, Burundi and Rwanda, as well as the Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, 7 November, the Secretary-General addressed another letter to the President of the Security Council, bringing out the dramatic deterioration of the situation in eastern Zaire in recent days and the very real threat to the lives of tens of thousands of men, women and children in the Zairian provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fighting in eastern Zaire has caused massive displacement of more than 1.2 million Burundian and Rwandan refugees, as well as tens of thousands of Zairians. About 400,000 refugees are now moving towards the north-western tip of Lake Kivu. More than 115,000 refugees who fled their camp last week are believed to be still on the move south. There is no information on 500,000 refugees in Bakavu and Uvira. At least 1 million Rwandan and Burundian refugees remain in Zaire west of Goma. It seems that the fleeing refugees are moving in search of water, rather than a planned displacement inside Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports of returnees to Rwanda indicate that people are dying of thirst.  Most of these victims of the armed conflict have been forced to abandon their camps and homes and move westwards towards some of the most inhospitable and inaccessible areas in Zaire, whereas many others have fled to the United Republic of Tanzania and Uganda. The United Nations and its humanitarian agencies, as well as relief non-governmental organizations, have for the past several months rendered invaluable service by distributing food and other necessities to the needy, often against heavy odds in extremely dangerous circumstances. To his regret, however, the Secretary-General was obliged to authorize the temporary relocation of the international staff to neighbouring countries for reasons of safety and security. These staff will return as soon as security conditions permit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation in eastern Zaire calls for determined, effective and immediate action by the international community. It is imperative to stabilize the situation and establish conditions for the safe delivery of humanitarian assistance to the refugees and displaced persons. In this regard, the Secretary-General welcomes the initiative of seven African Leaders to convene their first summit on the situation in eastern Zaire, which took place in Nairobi on 5 November. This summit, with which the Organization of African Unity was associated, has called for the immediate setting up of safe corridors and temporary sanctuaries inside Zaire to facilitate humanitarian assistance and the repatriation of refugees. For this purpose, airfields and border crossing points would have to be secured and logistics bases in eastern Zaire protected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nairobi summit has requested the Security Council to take urgent measures to deploy the required force to ensure these objectives. Under normal circumstances, the Secretary-General would obviously prefer that the Council should decide to deploy a United Nations peace-keeping force, under the control and command of the United Nations. However, in this situation, time is of the essence. Every passing day literally costs thousands of lives.  Consequently, in his letter of 7 November, the Secretary-General has conveyed to the Security Council his considered judgement that the best option available at this stage is for a group of Member States to decide to establish a multinational force under the authority of the Security Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Secretary-General has noted that the Security Council already has under active consideration a proposal whereby it would authorize Member States to make necessary arrangements to ensure the safe delivery of humanitarian assistance to the needy population. The momentum seems to exist for a concerted action by the international community. The Secretary-General strongly appeals to Member States which are in a position to do so to contribute to it in whatever way possible. Needless to say that any action mandated by the Security Council would be implemented in close consultation with the Organization of African Unity and the countries of the region.  Indeed, such consultation is ongoing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world has been watching on television screens the unimaginable sufferings to which the populations in eastern Zaire have been and continue to be subjected. The fact that a fairly large-scale movement of people from Zaire has taken place towards the United Republic of Tanzania, Uganda and Burundi emphasizes the regional dimension of the crisis. The Secretary- General is confident that the international community will not fail to discharge its moral obligation to rescue these most unfortunate populations, and to take immediate action to put an end to the hostilities in the region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PART II - DETAILS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. EAST AFRICA: REGIONAL OPERATION FOR BURUNDI, RWANDA, ZAIRE AND TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. EASTERN ZAIRE - most information as of 7 November</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 Readers are directed to the Emergency Updates on Eastern Zaire produced by the DHA Integrated Regional Information Network for detailed coverage of the crisis. Reports are available via e-mail: irin@dha.unon.org or fax: 254-2- 622129.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 Late news, 9 November: WFP is flying 100 metric tons of high energy biscuits to Entebbe for use in the region. As soon as access is possible, WFP anticipates that food commodities of this type will be urgently needed in the first few days of renewed operations. Belgian and Netherlands air force planes are being used for the airlift.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 General situation: except for the recent movement of returnees back to Burundi, relatively small numbers of refugees were recorded over the past week as fleeing from Eastern Zaire into Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzanian, Angola and Zambia. Refugees on the move in Eastern Zaire are faced not just with the fighting but also with hostile geographical terrain, in the form of mountains, volcanic ground and forests, and in addition often torrential rain. During the week little information was available from this part of Zaire due to inaccessibility caused by on-going insecurity and poor communications; only restricted contact with Goma possible and access to Uvira and Bukavu remained limited. A brief chronological summary of main events per location follows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 Regional - to 7 November 1996</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nov 3 - Calls by UNHCR for humanitarian aid corridors to be set up to enable refugees to return to Rwanda and Burundi. Nov 4 - Three-week cease- fire announced by the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) Nov 4 - Zairian government acknowledges that it is no longer in control of Goma and Bukavu in eastern Zaire. Nov 5 - Regional Summit held in Nairobi; resolutions include calls for neutral military intervention, the establishment of humanitarian corridors and temporary sanctuaries, and an immediate cease-fire. Zairian Government not present at the summit. Burundian Government not invited. Nov 5 - UN Security Council holds consultations on the humanitarian crisis. Nov 6 - UN names coordinator for the Eastern Zaire emergency, Mr. Sergio Vieira di Mello, Assistant High Commissioner for Refugees, to be assisted by Mr. Martin Griffiths, Director, Department of Humanitarian Affairs. (On 30 October the UN had announced the appointment of Mr.Raymond Chretien, Canadian Ambassador to Washington, as UN mediator for the region.) Nov 7 - European Union convenes a Special Development Council meeting in Brussels with senior UN relief officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.5 Goma</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nov 2 - Continued heavy fighting in and around Goma town obliged humanitarian agencies to evacuate all international UN and NGO staff (108 staff members). Evacuation takes place by road through Gisenyi to Kigali, then on to Nairobi by air. Nov 3 - Heavy fighting reported in Katale area, north of Goma. Refugees are reported moving north and west deeper into Zaire to seek safety. Nov 3 - rebels declare Bukavu and Goma are under their control. Nov 5 - Unconfirmed reports indicate that the population of Mugunga camp is moving west towards Sake (west of Goma on the north-west tip of Lake Kivu) in search of water. Nov 6 - Unconfirmed reports of mortar fire from Goma to Sake area, injuring 30 persons. Nov 7 - Situation in Goma town reported to be relatively calm but tense; conflicting reports on situation in Mugunga camp, still inaccessible due to insecurity on the western road. Road north to Katale and Kahindo also inaccessible. Growing shortage of food in Goma and Bukavu reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.6 Bukavu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nov 2 - Reports from Bukavu that situation calm and the town under control of Banyamulenge. Availability of basic commodities, including food, very critical. Nov 7 - Although the Bukavu town still reported calm, the surrounding refugee camps have emptied. Unconfirmed reports that the road between Bukavu and Goma, and possibly Bukavu airport, have been mined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.7 Uvira</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nov 2 - Reports reach WFP Cyangugu from a journalist who travels by road from Cyangugu to Uvira via Bugarama and Kamanyola, that the town of Uvira was calm and mostly controlled by Banyamulenge. The town had been seriously affected by looting. Some commercial activities resumed, and food available through local traders. The refugees camps around Uvira are reported totally empty. Nov 7 - Some 100,000 persons are reported around Uvira town. It is unclear if these people are refugees or nationals. Nov 8 - WFP makes contact with local WFP staff at the Uvira office. The staff report that WFP stocks of between 1,000 to 1,500 metric tons are intact in WFP warehouses and at port.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.8 Kinshasa and elsewhere in Zaire</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) From November 2 onwards, reports throughout the week of anti-government protests in Kinshasa, harassment of Tutsis and the looting of property belonging to Tutsis. Demonstrations in town frequently led to vandalism. UN and NGO vehicles have been systematically seized by armed people. The situation is reported quite tense in Lumumbashi and Kalemie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) By November 7, reports of serious situation in Kisangani, 500 km north- west of Bukavu and Goma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. BURUNDI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.1 By 4 November, about 10,500 Burundians from the refugee camps in the Uvira area had crossed the border from Zaire at Gatumba, where they were assisted at a transit site. Access to the border area was denied to humanitarian agencies until 6 November. As at 7 November the health and nutritional status of those who are arriving in Gatumba is described as alarming. One-week rations given to all returnees by WFP distribution team.  On their departure from the transit site, each person receives a three-month ration (31.5 kg).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.2 The Burundian Government intends to transfer the returnees from Gatumba to their homes as soon as possible. Despite insecurity in many areas, about 5, 000 had been transported. Although many returnees went back to homes in Bujumbura Ville and Bujumbura Rural, the majority originate from insecure areas in Cibitoke and Bubanza provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.3 WFP was able to undertake an assessment mission this week to Cibitoke, an area normally off-limits to UN personnel because of insecurity, under military escort, with other humanitarian agencies. The mission estimates that there are as many as 20,000 as yet unregistered returnees in and around Cibitoke. They have no food and are in a pathetic condition surviving on roots and leaves. WFP will attempt to undertake a distribution to them as soon as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.4 The north of Burundi experienced a dramatic deterioration of security, in Kayanza, Muramvya, and Gitega provinces in particular, which will increase the numbers of people in need of emergency food relief. Increased rebel activity seems to have been manifested by attacks on displaced sites, on the military, and on local authorities in several areas. Many casualties have been reported including a local off-duty staff member of UNICEF in Bujumbura Rural.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.5 208,800 litres of fuel was imported by WFP to Bujumbura from Rwanda during the week. The fuel will be distributed to the humanitarian agencies working in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.6 Following a decision by regional states to exempt humanitarian aid for Burundian displaced persons from the sanctions, WFP has requested permission to import 2,500 mt of food relief per month. Currently, 3,622 mt of different commodities are in the pipeline for the next three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.7 Needs assessment and subsequently distribution of emergency relief to 2, 491 beneficiaries possible in Kayanza province; further needs assessments were carried out in other communes following population movements due to increased insecurity in Kayanza province and in Ngozi province. CRS Gitega reported distributing WFP emergency relief rations to 12,346 beneficiaries in various locations in Gitega and Muramvya provinces over the past several weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.8 WFP Fokker 50 aircraft capable of carrying 50 passengers, started regular Nairobi-Bujumbura flights at the beginning of November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. RWANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.1 The security situation in Rwanda remained calm during the past week with the exception of Gisenyi and Cyangugu, where fighting took place across the borders of Zaire and Rwanda. In Cyangugu, the fighting intensified during the night of 29 October. In Gisenyi, the fighting intensified on 31 October and 1 November; WFP staff were temporarily relocated to Nkamira Transit Centre on 1 November. Other UN Agencies and NGOs sought refuge in Ruhengeri.  The situation is now calm and WFP activities in these prefectures have resumed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.2 A WFP Headquarters Mission to the sub-region, led by the Director of Transport and Logistics Division, visited Rwanda from 2 to 6 November to develop emergency response strategies in relation to the evolving humanitarian crisis in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.3 From 28 October to 4 November, a total of 2,886 returnees arrived from Eastern Zaire; 1,584 in Gisenyi and 1,302 in Cyangugu. In addition, 4,956 Zairian refugees arrived from Eastern Zaire; 4,876 in Gisenyi (which includes the influx on 27 October) and 80 in Cyangugu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.4 In Gisenyi, the Zairian refugees who were at Umubano camp (total 15,430) have been relocated to the local stadium for security reasons. They are currently in the process of being relocated to Kibuye. A total of 5,337 have already arrived and are temporarily accommodated in four different locations, mainly the transit centre in Kibuye and a vacated agricultural school. They will be relocated to an identified site in Mount Karonje as soon as preparations are finalised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.5 The Rwandan Red Cross, responsible for food distribution in the newly established refugee camp at Mudende University in Gisenyi, has temporarily left Gisenyi due to recent fighting. COOPI has been requested to carry out food distributions pending the return of the Rwandan Red Cross. A total of 4, 860 refugees are currently hosted in Mudende University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.1 As of 7 November the number of refugees escaping from the fighting in South Kivu who have arrived in Kigoma since the weekend of 2-3 November was at 4,611. Of these, some 3,800 are Zairians and the rest are Burundians, with a small number of Rwandans. Refugees are continuing to cross Lake Tanganyika by boat from Baraka. The Burundian refugees are being transferred to the refugee camps at Kasulu and the Zairians have been given shelter in an emergency compound within Kigoma town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. UGANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.1 As of 4 November, 10,000 people had crossed the border from Zaire into Uganda at Ishasha and 6,800 at Kisoro (the majority being Zairian nationals).  WFP provided CSB to people at both locations. On 4 November BBC reported that rebels had taken control of Ishasha border post. The rate of arrival of refugees into Uganda decreased over subsequent days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. LIBERIA AND SIERRA LEONE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. LIBERIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 Councilman Charles Taylor escaped an assassination attempt by unidentified gunmen on 31 October. The attack, which occurred at the Executive Mansion, killed three persons associated with Mr. Taylor. As a result of the attack, the ECOMOG Force Commander imposed an extended curfew from 1900 hours to 0600 hours. As of 8 November, the curfew is still in effect. Some international NGOs have reduced staff numbers in Liberia as a result. Overall situation in Monrovia is reported to be stable at the present time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 On 28 October, a mob of 1,500 to 2,000 displaced persons stormed the Phebe hospital premises, location of the WFP warehouse, and looted a total of 124 metric tons from the warehouse and loaded trucks. WFP and Lutheran World Federation/World Service staff were held hostage for nearly two hours and two relief staff were physically assaulted before unarmed police were able to contain the situation. Food loaded on trucks was waiting departure for distribution to 8 of the 18 displaced shelters between Cari and Gbarnga the same day. Distribution in the area has been postponed pending investigation and security guarantees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 From 30 October to 5 November, WFP delivered 35 metric tons commodities to Action Contre la Faim in support of 3,013 therapeutic and supplementary feeding patients in Gbarnga. WFP delivery of food to Save the Children UK for Vulnerable Group Feeding programmes in Upper Margibi interrupted for one-week due to the incident at Phebe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. SIERRA LEONE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.1 WFP Freetown cereal stocks have been depleted, with CSB and vegetable oil stocks at extremely low levels. Stock rupture will result in a delay in Freetown distributions until mid-November. November and December pipeline for Sierra Leone is also low. In addition, WFP Sierra Leone is in urgent need of vehicles for staff movement vital to the monitoring and implementing of operations throughout the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.2 Some 26 local militia kamajors were killed by government soldiers on 29 October in Njala (Moyamba district, some 45 km from Bo). Violence started when kamajors apprehended soldiers looting property from the Njala college campus. A truck carrying kamajors to Njala to carry out an investigation was ambushed, and fighting erupted in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.3 Airlift organized to evacuate 24 international relief workers, including 2 WFP staff, when the conflict spread to Bo on 30 October.  Casualties also reported in Bo but numbers are not yet confirmed. The situation has since stabilised, and humanitarian agencies have largely returned to Bo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.4 Around 2,000 people were liberated from RUF captivity by kamajors on 6 November off the main Bo-Freetown highway only 38 miles from Freetown. A rapid inter-agency assessment of their condition is currently under way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.5 WFP Sierra Leone reports that conditions of freed captives in Blama have improved through therapeutic feeding programmes. A total of 1,118 people have been liberated from the RUF rebels by the kamajors in Blama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.6 An inter-agency mission, including WFP, assessed the critical situation in Tonkolili district following rebel attacks which left at least 5,500 persons displaced. Some 35 persons were killed and 12 wounded in attacks.  With slightly improved security conditions at present, WFP is providing a one- time food distribution through the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.7 Newly displaced in Makeni district are thought to total 11,300, with a further 6,800 displaced in Magburaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.8 Reports from Segbewema (south-east Sierra Leone) indicate that hundreds of RUF fighters are surrendering in the area. Skirmishes are reported between RUF rebels and kamajors in the Pujehun district (south-west Sierra Leone).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. ANGOLA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 Quartering and Demobilisation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) The demobilisation process of UNITA rebels is seriously behind schedule.  The demobilisation of child soldiers was originally scheduled to start in June, but only began three months later. By the end of October, some 7,000 soldiers under the age of 18 had gathered at UN-supervised assembly camps and of these just 495 had been demobilised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) The quartering process of an estimated 62,500 UNITA soldiers began on 20 November 1995. Some 26,300 former UNITA soldiers are to be incorporated into the united Angolan Armed Forces, with the balance to be demobilised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">c) Due to the prolongation of quartering, originally planned for a maximum of 5 months, food resources earmarked for the WFP emergency operation are close to depletion. The expansion phase of the project calls for an additional 18,260 mt mixed commodities, to sustain a prolonged duration of quartering, provide a supplementary food ration to dependants living in the family areas of the QAs, and feed disabled soldiers, who will be quartered for a short period before demobilisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">d) Donors are requested to provide needed commodities on an urgent basis to ensure the smooth continuation of support by WFP to the quartering areas through January 1997, and the simultaneous demobilisation process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 WFP also appeals to donors for urgent pledges of 14,680 metric tons commodities (maize 11,000 metric tons; pulses 1,380 metric tons; and oil 2, 300 metric tons), required to continue projects under WFP Protracted Relief Operation 5602 to displaced and war affected people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwe and Jamaica on Thursday reached an agreement that will see the establishment of a joint commission tasked with strengthening and consolidating the existing political, economic and cultural relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement was signed by Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge and his Jamaican counterpart Benjamin Clare, in the presence of President Robert Mugabe and Jamaican Prime Minister Percival Patterson.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The joint commission would be empowered to set up ad hoc committees. The ad hoc committees would be constituted by experts of a specific field to carry out identified projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Realizing the critical role of the private sector in economic growth of any country, the commission would also have membership of private sector practitioners.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The Fighting and refugee crisis in eastern Zaire continues to attract the editorial attention of African newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kinshasa newspaper, Le Soft, described the war as &quot;a successful international plot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added that since &quot;the whole of Kivu&quot; was &quot;under Rwandan control&quot; nobody but the Gabonese president, Omar Bongo, had condemned &quot;the invasion of Zaire.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added: &quot;Instead, there are initiatives which tend to reinforce the fait accompli...to condone the forcible occupation of Zaire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said that &quot;the only concern&quot; of the international community was the fate of some 1.2 million Rwandan refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are the only ones worth taking care of, the only ones deserving solidarity,&quot; it said. &quot;Yet it is no thanks to them that death, desolation, as well as political and social instability have come to Zaire,&quot; it concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No matter how one might describe the insurrection, Kenya's oldest newspaper, the East African Standard, looked at the antecedent of the problem. Largely, it blamed the colonial disregard for Africa's ethnic reality and the division of a people for the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They divided and ruled Africa for nearly 70 years,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another 40 years later, it noted, the discontent created by artificial borders was being blamed for Africa's instability. Although this may be true, it said, Africa's independent governments had failed to accommodate this historical mistake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would have made political sense and less damage in the long run if countries that blame their border tensions on colonialism had translated the conflicts into a value for these communities through trade and cultural exchanges,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When governments become too rigid to the extent that a Tutsi in Rwanda needs a visa or a passport to visit folk across the border, it went on, people began to treat the boundaries a as a problem. &quot;Today Africa is being told that the border problem is getting out of hand between Zaire and Rwanda.  It has happened before in West Africa,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of Zaire today, it said, it was not the question of this war leading to a redrawing of borders or bringing peoples with a shared history together: It was simply a case of &quot;opportunists taking advantage of a power vacuum in Zaire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fate of a country should not be left in the hands of one man,&quot; it said.  &quot;It is no longer safe to wait for the ailing Mobutu Sese Seko to decide. The country must be protected with or without the strongman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It pointed at what it said was this mistake in many African countries where institutional capacity to run the affairs of state was being replaced by the power of the father figure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that the emperor is indisposed, the empire is in trouble. The Tutsi rebels have, and their allies are merely taking advantage of the power vacuum, &quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the re-election of Bill Clinton to a second presidential term in the United States, the Dakar privately-owned newspaper, Sud Quotidien, wondered how Africa would fare in the administration's policies over the next four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Already, the White House has adopted a timid attitude with regards the problem in the Great Lakes. It continues to agree with Paris on the need for an international conference on the problem,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the elections over, it added, the United States' opposition to a second term for Boutros Boutros-Ghali, as secretary-general of the United Nations, might weaken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Especially since Africa and the Arab League continue their support (for Boutros-Ghali),&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Some 800 nurses have been dismissed in Zimbabwe and an unspecified number of doctors will be fired Friday, as the government maintains its hardline position against striking health workers who have crippled the nation's hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acting labor and social welfare minister, Nathan Shamuyarira, told a news conference Friday that the government was determined to effect the dismissals and was seeking replacement staff locally and abroad.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The striking nurses and doctors are no longer part of our calculations in restoring health services,&quot; Shamuyarira said, adding that the dismissals would have immediate effect and that the affected employees should surrender government vehicles and accommodation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shamuyarira appealed to members of the public to be patient during the crisis saying it would take up to three months to restore health service to normal levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advertisements had been placed in South Africa, Britain and a number of African countries, he said, in response to a question, but denied that the government might have to pay expatriate staff more than the zimdollars 81,000 (8,100 US dollars) annual salary for junior doctors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nurses and doctors are demanding better pay and working conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shamuyarira also dismissed growing criticism from civic organizations and sections of the print media that the government was being insensitive in view of the many deaths attributable directly to the three-week old strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We regret the deaths,&quot; he said. &quot;The government is very sensitive to the problem. It's the doctors and nurses who are insensitive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shamuyarira began his statement by praising doctors and nurses who did not join the strike describing them as &quot;patriotic officers&quot; who should get recognition and awards for remaining at their posts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On whether the dismissed workers could re-apply, Shamuyarira said they could within 30 days but it would be on an entirely new basis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York (PANA) - Senator Paul Simon has urged the U.S. government to drop its &quot;embarrassing opposition&quot; to the re-election of the U.N. Secretary- General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, even as the Washington steps up its campaign to remove him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simon, a democrat from the state of Illinois, told a press conference in Washington D.C. on Thursday that with the U.S. elections over, the country should handle the situation with &quot;rational thinking&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are wrong (and it) is an embarrassment,&quot; Simon said, calling the U.S.  opposition to Boutros-Ghali, a seasoned Egyptian diplomat, a &quot;gross diplomatic blunder.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the U.S should be open to a compromise that would allow the secretary-general to remain at the helm of the world body after the expiration of his five-year term on Dec. 31, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The assumption is that we are prepared to veto the secretary-general -- the first secretary-general who would not be granted a second term -- either because of domestic political reasons or because he has on rare occasions shown independence from U.S wishes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Either reason is not worthy of a great power,&quot; he said. &quot;Greatness suggests something more than a crude use of power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simon, who is retiring from the Senate in 1996, said that the U.S. action, particularly when it is owing a 1.5-billion-dollar debt to the U.N., had offended many countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we were paying our dues to the U.N., and bearing our full share of other international burdens, our actions would not be welcomed, but they would not be reprehensible as they are now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, U.N. spokeswoman, Sylvana Foa, has denied a report that the secretary-general was meddling in U.S. politics by seeking support for his case in the Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foa told correspondents in New York that the secretary-general had a lot of friends in the U.S Congress and had received from them phone calls expressing solidarity with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think there is any law against taking phone calls from your friends,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She described the allegation that the U.N. chief, who will be 74 next week, was seeking support in the U.S Congress as part of &quot;smear stories and disinformation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foa said that although the secretary-general had made himself available for a second term should U.N. member states want him, he was not campaigning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The secretary-general is not campaigning. He is not electioneering,&quot; she said. &quot;This man does not have time for a decent breakfast. He does not have time to mess around with frivolous phone calls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. has vowed to bar Boutros-Ghali, using its veto if necessary, for not vigorously carrying out reforms at the U.N.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Security Council, upon whose recommendation the secretary-general is elected by the General Assembly, is expected to take up the issue next week, and a final vote is possible by the end of November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Organization of African Unity has endorsed the candidacy of Boutros- Ghali, the first African U.N. secretary-general, for a second term of office.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - A Nigerian Boeing 727 private airliner with 141 people on board has crashed in a lagoon, some 30 km (19 miles) east of Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All on board, including nine crew members, are feared dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wreckage of the plane was found Friday, after a massive search involving airforce helicopters, police and aviation personnel.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plane had been reported missing late Thursday, while on a scheduled domestic flight from the southeastern city of Port Harcourt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Aviation Development Company (ADC) Flight 086 lost contact with the control tower minutes before it was due to land in Lagos at 5 p.m. (1600 GMT).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause of the crash was not immediately clear. But the aviation ministry said details of the crash will be made public after an assessment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian Aviation Minister Air Commodore Ita Udo-Imeh was reported to have gone to the crash site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The offices of ADC and the aviation authorities at the local wing of the Murtala Muhammed international airport at Ikeja, Lagos, were besieged Friday by anxious relatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The airline has declined to release the manifest or passengers' list, further fuelling the anxiety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An official who asked not to be named described the matter as &quot;sensitive&quot;.  ADC is fully owned by Nigerian shareholders and is the only locally owned airline quoted on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. The Airline is considered efficient and has had a relatively good safety record, since it began operations in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The carrier operates domestic services and flies to some West African countries. One of its planes crashed in Liberia in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest accident is the third major air crash in Nigeria in 1996, and brings to 46 the total number of air mishaps in the country in the last 26 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January, a presidential HS-125 jet crashed in the northern city of Kano, killing 14 people, including Ibrahim Abacha, son of Nigerian head of state Gen. Sani Abacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another crash in the middle belt city of Jos, in June, killed a state military administrator (governor) and 10 others.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The Sierra Club today released a letter it sent to President Clinton that calls on the President to help the Ogoni people of Nigeria in their struggle against pollution caused by Shell's oil exploitation. The letter also calls on the President to again push American allies to adopt a series of Nigerian sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter was signed by Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope and by Dr.  Owens Wiwa, brother of the late Ken Saro-Wiwa, the writer and environmentalist whom the Nigerian government hanged last year along with eight other Ogoni leaders. Environmentalists believe that Saro-Wiwa was executed because of his effective grassroots organizing directed at the devastation from Shell's oil exploitation in the Ogoni region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today, another 19 Ogoni prisoners are being held on a politically- motivated murder charge for wanting social and environmental justice for the Ogoni people&quot; said Pope. &quot;They could also face a military appointed tribunal, an unfair trial and the same hangman's noose unless the Clinton administration and Shell intercede.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January of this year Shell admitted that it had imported firearms for the Nigerian police force. Last week the Managing Director of Shell Nigeria announced the company's sponsorship of a hospital in the Ogoni area of Nigeria. Dr. Wiwa noted the irony of Shell's influence in the Ogoni region. &quot; What a cynical gesture,&quot; said Dr. Wiwa, &quot;they open a hospital to treat the people wounded by their own guns. Shell's weapons were used against any Ogoni who dared speak out against the company's pollution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rather than restore the environment in Ogoni or pay reparations to the communities the company polluted, Shell has hired public relations firms to counter our calls for environmental justice,&quot; said Stephen Mills, Director of the Sierra Club's Human Rights and Environment Campaign. &quot;No amount of advertising can cover up the fact that Shell operated in Nigeria for some 38 years, made billions of dollars, and left the Ogoni with polluted farms and rivers and without electricity, running water, schools or hospitals,&quot; Mills continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions are high in the Ogoni region of Nigeria on this, the one year anniversary of the executions. A ban on all public meetings, rallies and other events remains in effect, and the military has increased their presence in the area, attempting to crush any attempt by the Ogoni to memorialize their leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nine days after the Ogoni were executed, the Sierra Club Board of Directors voted to support an embargo of Nigerian oil and a consumer boycott of Shell products until such time as the company has cleaned up the pollution it has caused in Nigeria, agreed to conform to U.S. standards while operating in Nigeria, and paid compensation to the peoples adversely affected by their activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since endorsing the boycott, local affiliates of the grassroots environmental group have held pickets, rallies and demonstrations. The Sierra Club has also distributed thousands of &quot;Boycott Shell&quot; bumper stickers via its internet web page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Shell must be worried,&quot; said Mills. &quot;Why else would the company have recently dispatched its top public relations chiefs from Houston and London to discourage some of our members in St. Louis from working on this campaign.  They were sent packing though, and told they must first negotiate with the environmental organization which was led by Ken Saro-Wiwa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saro-Wiwa was the leader of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People, MOSOP. Most of the group's leaders are now living in exile outside Nigeria for fear of reprisal from the Nigerian military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TEXT OF LETTER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Mr. President:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One year ago this Sunday, writer and environmentalist Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni activists were hanged in a Nigerian jail because of their vocal -- and effective -- efforts directed at cleaning up the devastation from Shell's oil exploitation in the Ogoni region. We are writing to urge you to help the Ogoni in their struggle against Shell for a clean and healthy environment, and to urge you to take further, significant actions to punish Nigeria's generals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specifically, we call on you to again press American allies to prohibit new investment in Nigeria, freeze the overseas assets of Nigeria's rulers and, most importantly, impose an oil embargo against the country. Nigeria derives 90% of it's foreign revenue from oil. Because of this dependence, oil sanctions would quickly and effectively remove the funding General Abacha's despotic regime uses to silence environmentalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also call on you to send a message to Shell, and other multinational corporations, that you expect companies that do business in the United States to abide by the same environmental and human rights standards abroad as they are held to in this country. The Sierra Club and many other organizations are urging Shell to begin the environmental restoration of Ogoni, to pay reparations to the communities it polluted, and to use its extraordinary influence in Nigeria to see that 19 Ogoni currently being held in jail are released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 19 Ogoni prisoners are being held on similar politically-motivated murder charges for advocating social and environmental justice for the Ogoni people. They could also face a military appointed tribunal, an unfair trial and the same hangman's noose. Efforts to get the &quot;Ogoni 19&quot; a fair trial have been postponed indefinitely by government officials and local courts. Lawyers acting on the defendants' behalf were detained by the State Intelligence and Investigation Bureau. Outrage and condemnation from citizens and world leaders alike, followed the Ogoni executions. British Prime Minister John Major called it &quot;judicial murder.&quot; While the international community contemplated tough sanctions, none were taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unelected General Sani Abacha remains in power, swiftly imprisoning anyone who speaks against him, including those Ogoni who dare to seek environmental justice. A ban on all public meetings, rallies and other events remains in effect in Nigeria's Ogoni region. The military has increased their presence in the area, attempting to crush any attempt by the Ogoni to memorialize their leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We were optimistic that your administration would lead world efforts to sanction Nigeria's brutal military dictatorship. However, no substantial sanctions have been imposed against the generals by the U.S. Incredibly, the U.S. appears to be moving in the opposite direction. Two weeks ago at the meeting of the World Conservation Union in Montreal, the U.S. actually led the efforts against a resolution condemning Nigeria's human rights and environmental offenses. This appears to directly contradict the commendable efforts of your Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, John Shattuck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. did take some steps after the executions. Unfortunately, these actions had little effect on the oil- dependent military junta. Mr. President, we appreciate the your administration's condemnation of the executions last year. We appreciate the temporary recall of U.S. Ambassador Walter Carrington, a ban on the sale of military goods and services, a ban on military visas, and a U.S.-sponsored U.N. resolution. We must conclude, however, that tougher sanctions are required in order to successfully end this dictatorship's brutality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April of this year Secretary of State Warren Christopher in a speech at Stanford University announced his intention to place environmental issues in the mainstream of American foreign policy. He noted that &quot;addressing natural resource issues is frequently critical to achieving political and economic stability, and pursuing our strategic goals around the world.&quot; The case of Nigeria offers you the perfect opportunity to make this new policy a reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We commend Secretary Christopher for announcing these new environmental initiatives and we look forward to assisting in their implementation. We urge, however, that the State Department's new initiatives extend additionally to individual citizens in their right to protect the environment, and their right to clean water and clean air. Mr. President, we believe that environmental rights are directly linked to human rights. We believe that everyone has a right to a clean and healthy environment, be they American or Nigerian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We look forward to your response.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali called yesterday (Friday) for a multinational force to &quot;stabilise the situation&quot; in eastern Zaire. He told the Security Council that &quot;many tens of thousands of human beings are going to die of hunger and disease&quot; unless effective action is taken urgently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boutros-Ghali said he hoped that the 15-member Security Council would adopt a resolution for rapid military intervention within twenty-four hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 2am New York time this morning the Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution, adapted from a French proposal, that included recommendations for a multinational force to be set up &quot;for humanitarian purposes in eastern Zaire&quot;. However, the resolution only adopted the idea of military intervention in principle and requested member states to draw up plans for the proposed force. The resolution calls on the Secretary-General, in consultation with Special Envoy Raymond Chretien and Humanitarian Coordinator Sergio de Mello, with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the Organisation of African Unity, the Special Envoy of the European Union Aldo Ajello and with all States concerned to &quot;draw up a concept of operations and framework for a humanitarian task force, with military assistance if necessary&quot;. The objectives were described as delivering short-term humanitarian assistance and shelter to refugees and displaced persons in Eastern Zaire. It also called urgently for an international conference for peace, security and development in the Great Lakes region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no explicit mention of the use of Chapter VII in the resolution, which allows intervention without consent from the parties in conflict, or the use of force. Boutros-Ghali said on Friday he expected soldiers to &quot;use force&quot; if necessary. He also said that the objective of ensuring repatriation of the mainly Rwandan refugees might have to come at a later stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan President Bizimungu said yesterday that there should be no French, Belgian or Rwandan involvement in military intervention. Rebel spokesman Laurent-Desire Kabila also rejects French involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mobutu has told French newspaper Liberation that he accepts a &quot;de facto ceasefire&quot;, but continues to insist that the conflict is a &quot;Rwandan-led attack&quot;. He denies that his cancer is spreading, but says he will not return to Zaire &quot;for several weeks&quot; (he was reported earlier this week as saying he would return &quot;in a few days&quot;). He said he would &quot;take things in hand&quot;. French President Jaques Chirac said this week that Mobutu was the best person to resolve the crisis in Zaire, although the international community generally sees Zaire as &quot;rudderless&quot; and the president seriously ailing - physically and politically. Aid agencies are already warning that refugees and displaced people must be dying from lack of food and water, and hundreds of war victims have been buried by the Federation of the Red Cross in rebel held towns in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting late on Friday in Goma reportedly killed at least one person in the suburbs of the town - although the fighting was described as being at least fifteen kilometers west of Goma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relief community in Burundi is concerned about the prospect of meeting the needs of a possible large-scale return of over 100,000 Burundian refugees, while sanctions still apply to Burundi. Even though the Regional Sanctions Coordinating Committee has now exempted a wide range of food and non-food supplies sufficient for 250,000 displaced people, contingency stocks are at a low level. The Burundian government has appealed to refugees to return home.  An interagency team made a rare visit to Cibitoke yesterday, and found around 20,000 returnees staying in transit camps in very poor conditions. Direct aid to Cibitoke has been suspended by all international agencies for months due to insecurity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The turmoil in Zaire has led to a rise in military operations and rebel attacks within Burundi. The DHA Humanitarian Coordinator in Burundi reports that the Burundian rebels have had their supply lines fractured by fighting in Zaire, and that the Burundian military appears to be attempting to prevent FDD rebels traversing the country and seeking to establish bases in Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN Special Envoy Raymond Chretien is in Kinshasa today with Sergio de Mello, UN Humanitarian Coordinator for the Great Lakes, for talks with the foreign and defence ministers, and Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo. Chretien was reported by the press as saying the Rwandan government had pledged to &quot;use their influence, their contacts, with armed parties&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Youth Radio was created a year ago (November 1995) to provide a forum for the expression of young talent and creativity in braodcasting. A year earlier a television channel, Channel 21, was created for the similar purpose of giving greater attention to Tunisia's young people and to their interests. A television channel devoted to youth is considered by many in the region to be a unique endeavour.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tunis -- November 9, 1996</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 6 million passengers transited through Tunisian airports this year (until September 30), according to a report of the Tunisian Airports Authority (Office des Ports Aeriens de Tunisie, OPAT).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tunis-Carthage airport, Tunisia's principal airport, claimed the bulk of the passenger movement with 2.8 million, followed by Monastir airport (East coast) with 2.23 million, and Djerba airport (South) with 1.62 million passengers. The airports of Sfax and Tozeur each registered just over 50,000 passengers while Tabarka airport in the northwest registered 38,000 passengers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brussels - CRISIS IN THE KIVU - APPEAL TOWARDS THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS MEMBER STATES -- European NGO's from all backgrounds call upon the European Union and its member states to take up their responsibility in view of the crisis which is deteriorating the region of the Great Lakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TO THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In first instance the EU should help to facilitate humanitarian aid to the hundreds of thousands of Rwandese, Zaorese en Burundese refugees who are the victims of this new armed conflict. At their regional summit in Nairobi on 5 November, the African Heads of State and government leaders requested the United Nations to deploy, in cooperation with the OAU, a neutral force in order to protect the refugees and to establish humanitarian corridors so that aid can be provided. The EU must use every means in its power to respond quickly to this demand. In this regard, France and Great Britain, permanent members of the Security Council, have a specific responsibility. We call upon every member state of the UN to mobilize all necessary resources to give this neutral force the necessary support so that it can operate from the moment the Security Council grants authority.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clear political signals in order to prevent a further escalation of the war</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the current crisis, the seeds of a regional war are already present. To prevent such a catastrophy, it is imperative for the EU and its member states to send clear political signals to all the parties involved in the conflict.  These NGO's ask the EU and its member states to take following measures:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- impose an arms embargo on all states in the region</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- demand that all states involved in the conflict respect humanitarian and international conventions concerning the protection of human rights, esp. the right of asylum for refugees and minority groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- to reaffirm the principal of territorial integrity and inviolability of frontiers in conformity with the the Charter of the OAU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tackle the causes of the conflict</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The purely humanitarian approach of the Rwandese refugee problem in Zaore which has been implemented up till now, has led to a stalemate. The EU has the means to develop a political strategy to tackle, in the medium to long term, the real causes of the conflicts which should facilitate the voluntary and gradual return of the refugees to their country. Such a strategy must have 4 objectives:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Security: The presence, close to the border of Rwanda, of the former Rwandan army and militia amongst the refugees, represents a real danger for this country. The camps must be demilitarised and relocated further from the border, and the intimidators and those responsible for the genocide must be separated from the rest of the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Justice: the impunity of those who are responsible for the genocide and he massacres of 1994 on one hand , and the non</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- functioning of the judicial system, the situation in the prisons and the human rights abuses in Rwanda on the other hand, hinder any real chances for reconciliation and a voluntary return of the refugees. Everything possible should be done to enable the International Tribunal to fulfill its mandate.  At the same time, the government of Rwanda should be pressed to fulfill its responsibilities in matters of justice and human rights. The same problem exists in Burundi where a similar solution must be found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Democratization: a sustainable solution to the conflicts in the region can only succeed when the politics of exclusion of large numbers of the population have come to an end. This obviously implies that the nationality question of minorities in Zaire needs to be resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Sustainable economic development which creates real prospects for all inhabitants of the region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The ANC National Eexecutive Committee met in Johannesburg over the weekend of 9-10 November. The NEC discussed reports and overview of the political and economic situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was noted that, despite a number of difficult challenges on the financial front, the real economy is beginning to perform well, including significant increases in productivity and growing fixed investments. We are on target with regard to the macro-economic framework.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NEC discussed, endorsed and developed a proposal from the National Working Committee (NWC) to handle the political situation in the Free State.  The main features of this process are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Free State PEC will resign and the NEC has appointed an Interim Committee to run the affairs of the province and to help prepare for the next provincial conference. The members of this committee are Tito Mboweni, Joe Nhlanhla, Frene Ginwala, Malusi Gigaba and Dimpho Hani. The Secretary General's office will oversee the National Organising Department in its work in the province. Organisers from other provinces will be redeployed full time in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Premier and the MEC's will also resign. The process of consultation leading up to the election of a new Premier by the provincial legislature has already begun. The new Premier will then constitute a new executive council.  This may entail the redeployment of MP's, MPL's and others from different areas of activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The internal disciplinary processes within the ANC arising out of disputes among members in the Free State will be discontinued;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* And the NEC affirmed its support for the investigations being conducted by the Auditor General into allegations of corruption against members of the provincial government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A delegation of the NEC led by National Chairperson Jacob Zuma will this afternoon be briefing the ANC Free State Provincial General Council of these decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NEC underlined the necessity for expeditious handling of this process to ensure certainty, effective governance and the management of ANC affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NEC mandated a delegation meeting with the leadership of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). Details of this mandate are contained in the statement attached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NEC further agreed to hold a substantial ANC NEC Lekgotla in mid- January 1997. The Lekgotla will be a forum in which the NEC will assess our performance inside and outside government with a view to developing a programme of action for the next two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NEC received recommendations on a major Anti-Crime Campaign and on the revitalisation of a people-driven Masakhane Campaign. The NEC endorsed these recommendations and the NEC called on all our structures to implement these programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Nelson Mandela on behalf of the NEC saluted the role of outgoing Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa in the service of the movement and the people of our country try and in particular the negotiations and constitution- making processes. Comrade Ramaphosa will remain an NEC member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NEC was of the common view that in the face of many difficulties 1996 has seen the steady consolidation of the democratisation process and the fulfillment of the ANC's full mandate in government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - ANC NEC STATEMENT ON AMNESTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The African National Congress is the initiator of the idea of the TRC (Truth And Reconciliation Commission) process. It respects the law and the Commission. It respects and will continue to uphold the independence of the Commission. We made submissions to the TRC. It is for the TRC to consider those and other submissions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Many ANC cadres, fighters and members paid the highest price for their participation in the freedom struggle. Many hundreds were arrested, brutally treated, held in detention without trial, were extracted from them through torture, tried and sentenced in apartheid courts. Those who were subjected to this process and served their sentences do not have to apply for amnesty. A number of others applied for indemnity in terms of the Indemnity Act and Further Indemnity Act, had their applications considered by Indemnity Councils, made such disclosures as were required, and received indemnity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Persons who so received indemnity also do not have to apply for amnesty.  Others who were pardoned also do not have to apply for amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Persons who committed crimes, save capital offences, more than 20 years ago, also do not have to apply for amnesty because of the operation of the principles of prescription.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Persons who served their sentences, were indemnified or pardoned and those involved in &quot;prescribed&quot; offences therefore will not apply for amnesty.  In fact it would be legally inappropriate to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. There is need to understand the different roles and functions of the three different committees: 1. Amnesty Committee, 2. Committee on Human Rights Violations, 3. Committee on Rehabilitation of Victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) The process in the Amnesty Committee is a legal process. It impacts on crimes, charges, trials and sentences. Each application for amnesty is treated and considered against the same criteria and i terms of the same procedure. Even-handed treatment is implicit in this process. Amnesty is granted in respect of crimes and wrongs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) Committee on Human Rights Violations. The processes envisaged are different from those of the Amnesty Committee. They do not have the same legal consequences as in the case of the Amnesty Committee. Even-handedness is not an issue on this committee. Fairness, justness, human rights values, standards and norms and morality are the guidelines. The issue of gross violations of human rights is relevant to the work of this committee. This committee has its eye on the future. It must record violations and identify causes and over all, consequences, unlike the findings of the Amnesty Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. It is in the above context that the ANC comments on issues of struggle, oppression, the freedom struggle, morality, etc. We do so in the knowledge that international law is relevant and that the international community, including the United Nations, Non-Aligned Movement, Organisation of African Unity, the Commonwealth and the World Council of Churches, have all articulated positions on all these issues. International human rights norms are relevant. We have the right to say no.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC STANDPOINT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is in the context of our understanding of the different roles and functions of the two committees that the ANC says to the Committee on Human Rights Violation, (a) Apartheid was a crime against humanity. In the work of this committee, reconciliation does not mean sanitising or legitimising apartheid. (b) Reconciliation does not mean reconciliation between good and evil, but between people. For the sake of the future, we must establish the moral basis of reconciliation. (Compare the world attitude to Nazism). (c) The freedom struggle was a just struggle, so recognised throughout the world.  Reconciliation does not require that we should deny or trample upon the moral legitimacy and validity of that struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. It is in line with the above that the ANC makes the submission as we are entitled to do that: (a) All apartheid governments, their personnel, their forces, functionaries and agents participated in a crime against humanity. In the context of a crime against humanity, many leaders, personnel, functionaries and agents of apartheid committed gross violations of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(b) In the case of the ANC, neither it (as a liberation movement) nor any of its members were every involved in any crime against humanity. On the contrary, the ANC was involved in a just and heroic struggle. However, where during the course of that struggle violations of human rights did occur, these must be acknowledged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AMNESTY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. In the light of the above, there are a number of ANC person who will in appropriate cases apply for amnesty. Many have already done so. THe ANC itself accepts responsibility for acts committed during the course of struggle and will assist individual members in their applications. In fact the ANC long ago already set up a special subcommittee of the NWC, as well as similar committees in each province to assist members to submit applications.  Inaccurate reporting in the media is not the fault of the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. In so far as the third committee, the Committee on Rehabilitation of Victims is concerned, the ANC considers this to be a very important committee.  Justice must be done to victims and their families and communities. This committee must make appropriate recommendations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - UN agencies have crossed the border into Eastern Zaire from Rwanda with limited medical and nutritional supplies around midday today. Two UN interagency assessment teams looking at security and the general humanitarian situation reached Bukavu and Goma. They are expected back in Rwanda tonight. If security permits, more thorough assessments will be made tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group of NGOs also crossed into Goma today, among them Concern, Save the Children Fund (SCF-UK), Trocaire, MSF International and Merlin. Other NGOs have been given permission to carry out cross-border missions by Rwanda, but have not yet secured a go ahead from the rebel Alliance for the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid representatives say the Rwandan Minister of Health, Dr Joseph Karemera is involved in mediating with Zairean rebels on behalf of the aid agencies.  Over the last two days, the Rwandan government has been calling for international representatives to hold talks with the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government of Rwanda have authorised a number of NGOs to work in Eastern Zaire from Rwanda. The government says it is anxious that missions into eastern Zaire preempt the arrival of any international military force; and that assistance to eastern Zaire should not be a feeding and maintenance programme which perpetuates the existence of the established (though mostly dispersed) refugee camps. A cabinet meeting was convened on Saturday (Nov 8) by President Bizimungu, which called for all those involved in humanitarian assistance to be facilitated with travel documents. President Bizimungu said on state-run Rwandan radio that the government was looking for ways to send food and medicine to the refugees inside Eastern Zaire, with the assistance of the UN Humanitarian Coordinator. Bizimungu called for talks with the rebels to allow access to the refugees, but he said that if the &quot;militia&quot; (Interhamwe) and former Rwandan forces resisted by arms then that would be the time for the international community to intervene militarily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rwandan government says French, Belgian and Rwandan troops should not participate in an international intervention force. State radio continues to report &quot;heavy fighting&quot; around the Mugunga refugee camp, attributing it to Hutu militia and former Rwandan troops resisting the advance of rebel troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spokesman for the rebel ADFL, Laurent-Desire Kabila, announced in Goma on Sunday that a humanitarian corridor should be opened to Mugunga camp. The site, west of Goma town, held about 350,000 refugees shortly before the conflict. He has called for an &quot;absolutely impartial&quot; international force - excluding French participation - and says humanitarian organisations must contact the ADFL for authorisation to enter the rebel-held zone. The BBC report the ADFL saying that no aid workers who have previously worked in Zaire will be allowed into eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 600 Rwandan refugees have managed to cross into Rwanda over the last two days, reported as being in a weak condition. Some of the refugees had wounds - including machete wounds from fights over food - and many have swollen legs from many days of walking. Refugees talk of the terrible plight of those left behind, but the international community still has no real information on the whereabouts and condition of refugees and internally displaced people in eastern Zaire. A UN official told IRIN that eventual access would &quot;unlock horrors&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN Coordinator Sergio de Mello, this morning was still negotiating for access from the Zairean government in Kinshasa. Unlike NGOs, the UN is tied by a mandate which normally needs governmental approval to operate on the territory of a member state. However, the UN Secretary-General has personally authorized today's cross-border assessment missions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some thirty foreign journalists were told to leave Goma this morning - although some are believed to remain in the town. They now wait with the aid agencies on the Rwandan side to go back into the town. Journalists said access at the border had grown more restricted over the weekend. Last week, journalists and some aid workers were given access to Goma town after the rebels unilaterally declared a ceasefire; but fighting between rebels and armed Hutu extremists some 15 kilometres west of the town re-started on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most aid missions attempting to get into Goma town on Sunday were turned away by the rebel ADFL, with the exception of two convoys from the German NGO Christoffel-Blindenmission, carrying some medical supplies. Two members of MSF went into Bukavu on Sunday, but AFP reports they failed to meet with rebel authorities to get authorisation to take in relief supplies from Rwanda today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New refugee figures are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UGANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5,000 Zairean refugees in Ishasha and Butagota, of an original 9,000, have spontaneously repatriated. 4,000 have been moved to a new site at Matanda. 4, 500 remain at the Kisoro area, and will be moved to Nyakabande.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BURUNDI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2,000 returnees have been counted by UNHCR at Gatumba, 370 newly arrived yesterday. 8,000 from Gatumba have so far been returned to their home areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR reports 2,000 new arrivals a day at Kigoma, mainly Zairean. There are now about 20,000 refugees at Kigoma since the Eastern Zaire conflict began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign ministers from 17 African countries will meet in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, today on the crisis in Eastern Zaire. The OAU - which participated in the regional summit in Nairobi (Tuesday November 5) that made a clear call for international intervention - has been called on by the UN Security Council to work with the UN and regional leaders to help &quot;draw up a concept of operations and framework for a humanitarian task force, with military assistance if necessary&quot; (Security Council resolution, November 11). The OAU is expected to discuss plans for a neutral force to set up humanitarian corridors and temporary safe havens. France has called for a 5,000-strong force made up from troops from Africa, Europe and the United States, but French involvement is rejected by those involved in the conflict, except Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France is seen as a long-term backer of several regimes in the region, and still expresses support for ailing President Mobutu of Zaire, now recuperating from cancer in France. AFP reports a top OAU official saying it is possible that intervention may only involve African forces. Several African countries, including Ethiopia, Senegal, Congo, Chad and Mali have said they will contribute troops, and South Africa is reported to be ready to offer assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sergio de Mello, UN Humanitarian Coordinator for the Great Lakes, is in Kinshasa today, hoping to convince the Zairean authorities to authorise cross- border humanitarian missions. UN Special Envoy, Raymond Chretien is in Kigali.  European Humanitarian Aid Commissioner Emma Bonino with ministers from Ireland, Italy and the Netherlands, accompanied by EU officials, came from Kinshasa yesterday to Kigali. BBC quoted Emma Bonino as criticising the United States for holding up other member states prepared to go ahead with international intervention.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Aid workers crossed from Rwanda into Goma and Bukavu today. Among the aid workers crossing the border today were two UN interagency assessment missions into Goma and Bukavu. UNICEF and WFP supplies (mainly medicines and biscuits) were some of the goods supplied to Goma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(IRIN Note: IRIN Update 16 wrongly reported that a UN mission had crossed into Bukavu around midday November 11. However, they did not cross until about 16:30 local time. We regret the error. IRIN's next information meeting in Nairobi will be held tomorrow, Tuesday 12 November at 9am at the IRIN offices on UN Avenue, Nairobi)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The convoy into Goma, according to a BBC correspondent in the group, was escorted by rebel soldiers and its reception in the town was &quot;orderly&quot;. After an initial hold-up, the rebel authorities allowed aid workers to take relief goods into Goma stadium. Some of the supplies, from UN agencies and NGOs, including food, will be used in Goma's hospital. One UN official told IRIN that although aid workers had hoped to get supplies to refugees, rebels indicated that they would be used for the local population, at least initially. This could be an indication of the seriousness of the stand-off between the rebels and armed Hutu extremists west of the town, at Mugunga camp; or the desire of the rebels to &quot;legitimize&quot; their authority with international agencies and local people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid workers are anxious that the political and physical needs of the rebels do not get in the way of getting urgent supplies to desperate refugees and internally displaced people. One aid worker told IRIN that the cross-border delivery of a token quantity of aid to Goma, directed by rebel forces was &quot;a stage-managed photo-op&quot;. At least 70 international journalists reportedly went across with the aid workers, and relief workers were not allowed free movement once inside Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zairean Information Minister, Boguo Makeli, said in Kinshasa today that aid agencies would be abetting &quot;treason&quot; if they dealt with rebel forces. He said that &quot;if international organisations support a rebel, that would be real treason&quot;. He said the Zairean government would could withdraw the right of foreign aid organisations to work inside Zaire if they struck deals with the rebels. He also said that the rebel army was &quot;not Zairean&quot;. Permission and access from Kinshasa is important for aid workers to legitimise operations and because many of the refugees and displaced people are believed to be behind rebel lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four airlifts carrying 60 metric tons of High Energy biscuits (HEB) flew to Kampala (Entebbe) on Saturday, by the Belgium Airforce for the World Food Programme. Another airlift with 40 metric tons of HEBs were delivered to Kampala (Entebbe) today (Monday). The flights were organized by DHA's Military and Civil Defence Unit in Geneva.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some aid representatives are concerned that little attention has been paid so far to Uvira, the first town to be taken by rebels in eastern Zaire. On Sunday, a UNHCR Burundi representative, Hitoshi Mise, said there were more than 100,000 Burundi refugees missing since fleeing camps around Uvira and Bukavu last month. Around 140,000 of the 220,000 refugees who fled the Uvira camps were Burundian Hutus. About 40,000 have been accounted for, many having to return to their homes - a policy that drew criticism from Medecins sans Frontieres because of security concerns inside Burundi. Some 75,000 Rwandan Hutus who fled the Uvira camps are also missing. There were 220,000 refugees in Uvira before the conflict, compared to some 717,000 in Goma, and 310,000 in Bukavu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guardian journalist, Chris McGreal, who went into Uvira when it was first seized by rebels writes of the brutal deaths of Banyamulenge (Zairean ethnic Tutsis). Finding bodies of murdered civilians, he writes &quot;..mobs of young men have beaten, stoned or carved up people who until recently were their neighbours&quot;. He also describes how thousands of Zairean soldiers were flown into the the area as the Banyamulenge took up arms. As the Zairean soldiers fled, they killed as they retreated - meaning that Banyamulenge civilians who had managed to escape into the hills, suffered a second round of killings.  Aid workers fear that many of the atrocities yet to be exposed are behind the front line or inaccessible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Kenya's Sunday Nation, a local newspaper published in the lake port town of Kigoma, Tanzania, claimed an estimated 400 Zaireans drowed when an overloaded boat from Uvira (150 kilometres away) capsized in Lake Tanganyika on Saturday. According to the paper, another boat from Uvira is also reported missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Burundi, state-run radio reports an upsurge in conflict in the northern province of Kayanza, with about 30 displaced people killed in the Matongo commune. The increase in violence in Burundi is believed to be related to the conflict in Eastern Zaire because groups of Burundi Hutu extremists are now cut off from supplies in the camps in Eastern Zaire. Violence and insecurity is reported in the communes of Gatara, Gahombo, Muhuta, Butaganzwa, Rango and Matongo. Burundi is still restrained by regional sanctions, and the government has protested at not being involved in regional talks on eastern Zaire. Many of the Burundian refugees in Zaire come from insecure areas of Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan state-run radio has reiterated rejection of Rwandan, French and Belgium troops in the deployment of an international intervention force, and points to Belgian interests in a Kenyan ammunitions factory. The Eldoret factory was reportedly set up in February 1996. Quoting a Flemish daily &quot;De Morgen&quot;, Rwandan radio said that a Belgian armaments group, an affiliate of the French group GIAT, is reportedly supplying ammunition from the Kenyan factory to the Interahamwe militia in Zaire. However, it is unclear whether the factory is really operational. The Rwandan embassy in Kenya was closed down this year after a Rwandan diplomat was arrested and deported following the shooting of a Rwandan opposition leader in Nairobi. Rwanda has accused Kenya, since 1994, of hosting thousands of fugitives from the genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A company of 120 French soldiers are reported as deployed today (Monday) in Congo near the border with Zaire, reports AFP. &quot;Reliable sources&quot; are quoted by AFP as saying the deployment was not linked to the refugee crisis in the east of the country, but a &quot;precautionary measure&quot; following the anti- government demonstrations in Kinshasa Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Organisation of African Unity today called for the speedy deployment of an international force in eastern Zaire, with a &quot;clear mandate&quot;. Zaire was not represented at the OAU's conflict prevention meeting, where officials from 17 countries gathered. The Secretary General of the OAU, Dr Salim Ahmed Salim said the crisis had arisen because of the failure to find a solution to the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide, particularly the inability to separate bona fide refugees from armed extremists. He pointed out that the Government of Zaire, with OAU support, had expressed its readiness to move all the armed elements - especially members of the former Rwandese army - and relocate them further inland. It was abandoned because the international community could not find the resources needed. He said &quot;one cannot but lament the failure to act more decisively when the opportunity had presented itself&quot;. He said the effect of inaction was that refugees had been prevented from returning home, that destablilizing activities by armed elements had continued on the border, with killings and counter killings, and an escalation of tension between Zaire and Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia expressed &quot;deep disappointment&quot; in an opening speech that the UN Security Council had fallen short of calling for a UN-led force as recommended by the Nairobi summit (November 5th). He said a multi-national force paid for by the participants and through voluntary contributions would make it particularly difficult for resource-poor African nations to participate in any meaningful manner. He said the OAU meeting should focus on how African states could join the international community in effectively dealing with the situation in eastern Zaire, and said Ethiopia was ready to contribute in accordance with the principles outlined in the Nairobi summit. A spokesman in the Kenyan Foreign Ministry was quoted in today's East African newspaper as saying &quot;If you look at it as an African force, you are saying leave Africans to themselves. Theirs is to die in Yugoslavia while others cannot die in Zaire&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OAU meeting is also expected to try and reach a compromise between Zaire and Rwanda. So far, Zaire insists that the conflict is Rwanda-led and has not given permission to humanitarian missions for cross-border access.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emma Bonino, European Commissioner for Humanitarian Affairs said today that the international response is already too late for many of the 1.2 million refugees trapped in Eastern Zaire. She blamed the US for preventing other willing countries to proceed with military intervention. A US State Department spokesman said today that the US is not willing to commit itself to involvement because &quot;there is no coherent plan&quot; for international intervention, reports AFP. The spokesman said there are &quot;four to five competing proposals&quot; for a multinational force. However, he is quoted as saying that the US &quot;believes there will be a need for a humanitarian international force to care for the refugees&quot;. Member states are split over the issue of Chapter VII, which allows intervention without consent from the parties involved; and hold differing perspectives on whether priority should be given to repatriating refugees or to the civil war situation in Eastern Zaire - which includes various armed groups, and internally displaced people, as well as refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political discontent in Kinshasa continues, with Zairean security forces evacuating today two university campuses, believed to have initiated anti- government protests. Kinshasa was described by a BBC correspondent as being &quot; at a standstill&quot; this morning when students erected barricades on the outskirts of the city. Many offices were shut, either in sympathy with the protest or inability to get past the road blocks - which were taken down by the afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">738 refugees, mostly ethnic Tutsis have arrived in Brazzaville, neighbouring Congo, from Kinshasa. AFP reports that the refugees have been transferred to a former military training camp, are being forced to pay $40 each to the militia controlling the port when they arrive.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Truth Commission chairman Desmond Tutu finally patched up his differences with the ANC moments before climbing on to a flight to America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tutu met with ANC general secretary Cheryl Carolus, justice minister Dullah Omar and other party leaders at Johannesburg airport.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carolus said the organisation would encourage its members to apply for amnesty before the December 14 cut-off date, because &quot;we respect the independence of the commission and we have assured them that nothing said by the ANC was meant to undermine its authority&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dispute began last week when senior ANC leaders such as Mpumalanga leader Mathews Phosa said that ANC members responsible for &quot;acts of war&quot; such as the Church Street bombing in Pretoria did not need to apply for amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tutu had in turn responded that the ANC could not determine the grounds of its own amnesty, bypassing the TRC.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - This is number 34 (3-10 Nov) in a series of weekly reports from IRIN on general developments in the Great Lakes region. Sources for the information below include UN agencies, NGOs, other international organisations and media reports. IRIN issues these reports for the benefit of the humanitarian community, but accepts no responsibility as to the accuracy of the original sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* OAU foreign ministers were to meet in Addis Ababa Monday to discuss the crisis in eastern Zaire. The meeting is expected to discuss plans for a neutral force to set up humanitarian corridors and temporary safe havens.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spokesman for the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) Laurent-Desire Kabila announced in Goma Sunday that a humanitarian corridor should be opened to Mugunga camp, west of Goma. The camp housed some 350,000 refugees before the evaucation of international aid staff last week. More than 600 Rwandan refugees crossed into Rwanda over the last two days, reportedly weak with some suffering from machete wounds.  Rwandan radio said they were met at Nkamira transit camp by UNHCR officials for onward transport to their home communes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Security Council early Saturday adopted a resolution including recommendations for setting up a multinational force &quot;for humanitarian purposes in eastern Zaire.&quot; This followed a call Friday by UN Secretary- General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for such a force to &quot;stabilise the situation&quot; in the area. On Tuesday, at a summit in Nairobi, regional leaders had also urged the UNSC to take urgent measures to deal with the situation. However the resolution only adopted the idea of military intervention in principle.  Other recommendations included delivering short-term humanitarian aid to refugees and a call for an international conference on the Great Lakes region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu said Friday there should be no French, Belgian or Rwandan military involvement, and French intervention was also rejected by Laurent-Desire Kabila. On Saturday, Bizimungu said his government was investigating ways of sending food and medicine to the refugees inside eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In France, Zairean President Mobutu, in an interview with the French newspaper Liberation, denied his cancer was spreading but said he would not return to Zaire for several weeks. Previously his spokesman had spoken of &quot; several days&quot;. Demonstrations continued Thursday against Zairean prime minister Kengo wa Dondo as thousands of protesters occupied parliament accusing him of &quot;high treason&quot; and siding with the Tutsi rebels. On Monday, the Zairean government acknowledged it was no longer in control of the Goma and Bukavu areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* World Vision International reported that at least 12,000 refugees were crammed in two transit centres in the Tanzanian town of Kigoma. By Monday, there appeared to be no let up to the exodus of Zairean refugees crossing Lake Tanganyika into Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The results of the Nairobi summit on Tuesday were seen as a regional consensus in favour of military intervention. The summit also expressed commitment to the inalienable rights of all people within internationally recognised territorial boundaries, which was interpreted specifically as the Banyamulenge's right to Zairean nationality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In Burundi, the relief community Friday expressed concern over meeting the needs of a possible 100,000 Burundi refugees returning home while the country was still under sanctions. The turmoil in eastern Zaire led to a rise in military operations within Burundi. The rebels are reported to have had their supply lines broken by the fighting in Zaire and were forced to flee Kivu into Burundi. Burundi armed forces were trying to prevent the rebels from crossing to Tanzania and setting up new bases there. Heavy fighting was reported in Kayanza province last week. On Wednesday the Burundian government denied responsibility for any killings, despite the fact that bodies were being washed up on the shores of Lake Tanganyika. It said the bodies were a result of the Zaire fighting. The government again denied it was helping Tutsi rebels in eastern Zaire. Some 10,000 Burundian refugees are said to have returned home from camps in Uvira through the Gatumba border point.  Eight thousand of them have been moved to their home areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Burundi army officer on Monday said over 64 people were killed in two clashes between soldiers and Hutu rebels. The first clash occurred on October 31 in the province of Muramvya after rebels killed 23 Tutsis in a displaced people's camp. Soldiers returned fire, killing &quot;about 20&quot; rebels, the officer said. In Gitega province, guerrillas attacked military positions with the loss of one soldier and more than 20 rebels, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Sources close to Burundi UN special envoy Marc Faguy said a new regional summit to review Burundi sanctions could be held on 14 November in Arusha, Tanzania, after a sanctions committee meeting scheduled for 12 November in Lusaka was scrapped, AFP reported on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* On Wednesday the trial of Rwandan genocide suspect Clement Kayishema was postponed until 20 February by the UN International Tribunal at the request of his lawyer who asked for more time for access to prosecution documents.  Also on Wednesday, the UN Special Rapporteur for Burundi, Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, urged a similar genocide tribunal for Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A UN report on Wednesday condemned continued overcrowding in Rwandan jails. According to the report, 82,000 people were in detention at the end of October, a rise of over 2,800 compared with August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A leaked report on a UN investigation into sanctions violations has concluded that Zaire is playing a &quot;central role&quot; in helping Rwandan and Burundian Hutu rebels rearm on its territory. Commission head Mahmoud Kassem said illegal arms trade was big business, especially in Africa. Amnesty International has warned of further atrocities unless the arms flow to Zaire, Burundi and Rwanda is stopped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Uganda denied a newspaper report that Entebbe airport was being used as a transit point for Iranian arms destined for Rwanda. President Museveni's office issued a statement describing the report as a &quot;fabrication of someone's fertile imagination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Ugandan Natural Resources Minister Gerald Ssendawula told a parliamentary committee on Wednesday that Uganda and Kenya had practically settled their differences over electricity tariffs. He said Kenya had agreed to a payment increase of over 200 percent, but the accord still had to be signed by both countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Tanzanian army on Saturday announced a week of military manoeuvres, according to the semi-official Daily News. The appointment of a finance minister was awaited in Tanzania to replace Prof. Simon Mbilinyi who resigned last week over corruption allegations. Minister of State for Planning Daniel Yona was appointed acting finance minister. Meanwhile, President Mkapa on Tuesday urged prospective investors to channel their resources towards Tanzania, assuring them of fiscal incentives and legal protection.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The London-based human rights group, Amnesty International and a Zimbabwean pressure group, Sangano Munhumutapa, condemned Tuesday the police beating and teargassing of more than 200 people who had gathered Monday in Harare in support of striking doctors and nurses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International said the police action showed the Zimbabwean government's inability to tolerate dissenting voices.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Human rights do not appear to be faring well in Zimbabwe when nurses, students and concerned citizens are teargassed and hit with batons simply for protesting against government policy,&quot; said the organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Union had its secretary-general, Morgan Tsvangirai, and three others briefly detained for spearheading the demonstration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sangano Munhumutapa president Warlord Chakaredza said the police displayed &quot; arrogance and brutality&quot; which only helped erode the image of Zimbabwe as a democratic nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a naked violation of human and constitutional rights...As we solidly support the striking nurses and doctors, we are calling upon the entire civic society to mobilize for a national strike,&quot; said Chakaredza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nurses and doctors have been on strike for 22 days, demanding higher pay and allowances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strike has paralysed operations at the country's four largest hospitals in the capital, Harare, and Zimbabwe's second city, Bulawayo, and other major hospitals have virtually been closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has since fired over 800 nurses and 100 junior doctors.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The government's invitation to foreign doctors and nurses to apply for positions left by dismissed striking junior doctors and nurses has had no takers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources in the ministry of health and child welfare, Parirenyatwa and Harare central hospitals told the Zimbabwe Inter-African News Agency on Tuesday that they had not received applications to replace nearly 2,000 nurses and 232 junior doctors who were fired for engaging in the three-week strike that has crippled health services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government started advertising last week vacant posts for nurses dismissed two weeks ago for defying a government order to resume work by Oct.  30.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advertisements have also been placed in South Africa, Britain and a number of African countries. Locally interested people were asked to submit their applications at the hospitals in writing or in person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vacancies were at Harare Central, Parirenyatwa, Chitungwiza General and Marondera Provincial hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 800 of the 2,000 striking nurses and two of 232 junior doctors have received their dismissal letters so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One senior official at Harare Central Hospital said: &quot;To tell you the truth, we have not received any application letters so far. Where are they going to get nurses and doctors to replace those that they fired?.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you think a doctor or nurse in South Africa and Britain would be willing to come here because there is a crisis, which was as a result of a strike by nurses and doctors who are pressing for better working conditions and salaries?.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe's health delivery system was plunged into a crisis 22 days ago when nurses went on strike to press demands for increased night duty allowance, an introduction of a risk allowance, as well as general improvement of conditions of service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The work stoppage paralysed the health institutions, forcing the closure of two of Zimbabwe's major referral hospitals, Harare Central and Parirenyatwa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ROME, Italy (PANA) - Canada has offered to lead a multinational force to provide security for the resumption of humanitarian aid to over a million refugees caught in fighting in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a news conference Tuesday in Rome, U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said the troops, to number about 10,000, would also protect airfields so that medical and food aid can be flown in.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the next few days we will have a large force put together,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exact date of deployment is still being discussed as well as the exact number and composition of the troops expected from 12 countries. However, Boutros-Ghali said the troop strength would likely number between 10,000 and 12,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the force will come from Africa, France, Italy, and Spain. The United States will provide logistics. He said that after speaking with President Nelson Mandela recently, the South African leader had also accepted &quot;in principle&quot; his country's participation in the multinational force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said a South African team has been sent to eastern Zaire to assess the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Boutros-Ghali said that the Organization of African Unity has given backing to the deployment of the force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko has supported the deployment of such a force but Rwanda has said it is against the presence of troops from France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No timetable has yet been set for the duration of the operation, but Boutros-Ghali said at the end of its operation, &quot;the United Nations forces will take over.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - South Africa has stated officially that it is prepared to send troops to strife-torn Central Africa as part of an international force to bring peace to Eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Nelson Mandela confirmed Monday night in an interview on South African national television that he was prepared in principle to contribute troops to such a multinational force, but that he had not decided on the size of such a unit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African leader, who had previously resisted the idea of military intervention in African crises -- confirmed that he had made such a commitment to former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere -- who was in South Africa last weekend to discuss ways and means of attempting to end the crisis in the Great Lakes Region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela insisted, however, that he would first send a top-level delegation - - headed by the ministry of foreign affairs -- to Zaire for a detailed assessment of the situation there. Only when this team reports back would he be in a position to make a decision on the size of the South African component for such a force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was also adamant that any such action would need the sanction of regional organizations such as the Organization of African Unity and the Southern African Development Community.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Air Zimbabwe Corporation has suspended at least 35 engineers indefinitely for allegedly refusing to carry out maintenance work on a Boeing 707 which was to be used by President Robert Mugabe on his trip to the World Food Summit in Rome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The engineers, who are denying the allegations, were served with letters of suspension on Monday, signed by Adonisi Matikiti, acting senior manager for maintenance and overhaul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the letters read: &quot;this is to advise that you are suspended from duty with immediate effect with full benefits. This is to allow investigations regarding your assigned work which you were supposed to carry out on B707-Z-WKU on Friday 8 November 1996. The aircraft was supposed to be prepared for the VIP presidential flight.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The engineers were also instructed not to report to their work place and to stay at home at all times to facilitate investigations, a move described by the engineers as tantamount to house arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They defied the order and they were on Tuesday barred from entering Air Zimbabwe headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the engineers alleged they were away on duty in Bulawayo during the time they were said to have refused to do the work, while the rest alleged they carried out maintenance work, but only refused to work overtime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we refused to work overtime, the acting managing director instructed the acting foreman, a Zambian expatriate, to write all the names of engineers in the maintenance department,&quot; they alleged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He then mobilized three more Zambians to finish the maintenance (work),&quot; they further alleged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimbabwe Aircraft Maintenance Engineers Association (ZAMEA) said the move was an attempt to victimize the engineers for embarking on a go-slow to press for better salaries and working conditions, a move which paralysed the national airline for about two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an attempt to thwart the current negotiations on their demands,&quot; it alleged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZAMEA said Air Zimbabwe could not operate without the suspended engineers and it was going to appeal to engineers to stop servicing Air Zimbabwe aircraft worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Air Zimbabwe senior public relations manager David Mwenga said he was not aware of the suspensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Air Zimbabwe technicians in October went on a two-week go-slow over salaries, resulting in four aircraft -- half of the airline's fleet -- being grounded.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) has lashed out at media reports that he had rejected Deputy President Thabo Mbeki as his likely successor, branding them as &quot; superficial sensationalism signifying nothing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media reports Monday claimed Mandela had dropped a bombshell at the weekend, telling the ANC national executive committee and newspaper correspondents that he did not endorse Mbeki as the next leader.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC pointed out Monday night that Mandela had simply emphasized that it was not up to him alone to choose a new leader -- that was the prerogative of the national executive committee of his party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On South African national television Monday night, the South African leader said he would welcome the choice of Mbeki if he were elected as his successor, but re-emphasized that it was not his job to choose who filled his shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the organization elected Thabo Mbeki, I would fully support that,&quot; he said. &quot;He is highly capable, smart, influential and committed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbeki is currently on an eight-nation tour in Europe, aimed at attracting and increasing more foreign trade with and investment in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tour is seen here as the latest in a series of high-profile foreign trips helping to groom him for his eventual succession as head of the ANC and president of the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - The front line has moved west of Mugunga camp towards Sake, with rebels firmly in control of immediate access to the camp. The NGO American Refugee Committee (ARC), who received a report from personnel passing from Sake to the camp yesterday, say there are refugees in the camp. Rebels are allowing some people out of the camp. A member of ARC told IRIN that a first hand account of access to the camp indicated that &quot;the front line appears to have passed behind the camp&quot;. From Sake, rebels have erected road blocks towards Mugunga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ADFL are treating the camp as a &quot;prohibited zone&quot;, refusing local people, journalists and aid workers access west of Goma town. The road from Mugunga camp, west of Goma town, towards Sake is mined, with one blast yesterday causing several deaths. It is not known whether mines are only on the road (further into the interior) or whether the perimeters of the camp have also been mined. ARC reports that Mugunga hospital is still functioning.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Zairean Minister denounced the cross-border UN mission yesterday - described by the UN only as a &quot;first step&quot; - as a violation of its territorial integrity. Reuters reported Zairean Information Minister Boguo Makele saying that the mission represented &quot;a violation of our territorial integrity&quot; and that aid should be distributed to refugees within Rwanda.  United Nations Secretary-General Boutros-Boutros Ghali talked to Zaire's prime minister, Kengo Wa Dondo, by telephone yesterday (Monday November 11) and said the Prime Minister was &quot;willing to cooperate with the United Nations to facilitate the provision of humanitarian assistance&quot;. UN Humanitarian Coordinator for the Great Lakes Region, Sergio Vieira de Mello, was informed, so as to facilitate UN cross-border assessment missions from Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political discontent in Zaire and the civil war makes obtaining permission from Kinshasa difficult, particularly as it is unclear who has the power and influence to enforce decisions in the east. The Secretary-General had given the go-ahead to proceed with yesterday's cross-border missions despite Zaire's reluctance to give permission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNICEF says it is planning an airlift to Kisangani, organised via Kinshasa with the Ministry of Health. A preparatory mission to Kisangani was delayed in Kinshasa yesterday. UNICEF aims to preposition 100 tons of relief supplies in Kinshasa and then move supplies forward to Kisangani for displaced people.  UNICEF's Zaire director Steve Allen reported there are some 60,000 displaced persons at Lubutu, southeast of Kisangani, the vast majority of whom are probably Zaireans (AFP). He said they had probably walked up to 2-300 kilometers, some starting off in very poor condition. UNICEF wants to reactivate health clinics and centres in the area, where local staff try to continue work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid representatives in Nairobi say that despite the recent, limited moves into eastern Zaire, there is no indication of where the bulk of some 1.2 million refugees are. No satellite images have been made public; and concentrations of refugees in jungle and forest areas are invisible to aerial surveys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scores of French soldiers are reported to have arrived in Brazzaville, the Congolese capital, neighbouring Zaire. AFP reports they have been deployed in response to unrest in Kinshasa. AFP also reports that Congolese President Pascal Lissouba yesterday met the ailing President Mobutu of Zaire at his French Riviera villa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six trucks of supplies were brought in with the UN assessment mission to Goma yesterday for delivery to local hospitals. The UN convoys, along with those of NGOs were taken to the local stadium and obliged to remain there pending a meeting with a rebel &quot;technical committee&quot;. UN Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator Martin Griffiths, with the UN team and an NGO representative, talked to rebel spokesman Laurent Kabila about access and monitoring of distributions. UN officials emphasised to Kabila that humanitarian assistance in Eastern Zaire did not constitute recognition of the rebels, and said that there should be no rejection of international civil servants (UN staff) who have previously worked in the area. Since Friday, there have been reports that the rebels and the Rwandan Government were refusing access to personnel and some aid agencies who had previously worked in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second mission into Bukavu was composed of UNICEF, UNHCR, WFP and DHA, and met a representative of the ADFL. The UN team explained the need to do further assessment missions, and get guarantees from the ADFL on safety and access. The rebels are eager for supplies to get to local people and the internally displaced. UN missions are expected to try for cross-border access again today.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The ANC has noted a distorted report in the Star newspaper on President Nelson Mandela's briefing to the National Executive Committee meeting held over the weekend of 9-10 November in Johannesburg. The story is nothing but superficial sensationalism signifying not very much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC confirms that President Nelson Mandela did brief the National Executive Committee on the content of the interview he had conducted with the Sowetan. The interview appears in Monday 11 November edition of the newspaper.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this regard, the President had emphasised to the National Executive Committee old ANC policy that leaders are not anointed but elected by the National Conference of the organisation. It is a policy that has guided the movement throughout the years and which has the unequivocal support of Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having said so, the President went further to indicate that should the constitutional structures of the ANC elect deputy President Thabo Mbeki, the President would give such nomination his unqualified support. He would do so because he has confidence in Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's qualities as a leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 7 this year, President Mandela stated that it was not for him to designate a successor, but said he would support the ANC if it chose Mr.  Mbeki to succeed him. &quot;This is something that will be decided by the organisation but he (Mbeki) is a very talented and influential person. He is very popular and if the organisation elected him, I would feel they had made the correct decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed the Monday 11 November edition of the Sowetan states that the President reiterated that he would support the election of Deputy President Thabo Mbeki as his successor because he is &quot;a competent man who deserves that position (presidency)&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If anything, President Mandela at the meeting of the NEC reaffirmed his vote of confidence in the leadership abilities of Deputy President Mbeki in particular and the entire ANC collective leadership in general to pursue policies of reconstruction and development, reconciliation, peace and nation building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What President Mandela said to the NEC therefore was nothing new but merely reiterating what he said publicly before. What appears in the Star is a terrible reflection on the quality of the writer concerned. The ANC and President Mandela reiterates its view that ANC leaders are elected at duly constituted branch, provincial and national conferences.</SPAN></P>

ARC reports that Mugunga hospital is still functioning.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Zairean Minister denounced the cross-border UN mission yesterday - described by the UN only as a &quot;first step&quot; - as a violation of its territorial integrity. Reuters reported Zairean Information Minister Boguo Makele saying that the mission represented &quot;a violation of our territorial integrity&quot; and that aid should be distributed to refugees within Rwanda.  United Nations Secretary-General Boutros-Boutros Ghali talked to Zaire's prime minister, Kengo Wa Dondo, by telephone yesterday (Monday November 11) and said the Prime Minister was &quot;willing to cooperate with the United Nations to facilitate the provision of humanitarian assistance&quot;. UN Humanitarian Coordinator for the Great Lakes Region, Sergio Vieira de Mello, was informed, so as to facilitate UN cross-border assessment missions from Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political discontent in Zaire and the civil war makes obtaining permission from Kinshasa difficult, particularly as it is unclear who has the power and influence to enforce decisions in the east. The Secretary-General had given the go-ahead to proceed with yesterday's cross-border missions despite Zaire's reluctance to give permission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNICEF says it is planning an airlift to Kisangani, organised via Kinshasa with the Ministry of Health. A preparatory mission to Kisangani was delayed in Kinshasa yesterday. UNICEF aims to preposition 100 tons of relief supplies in Kinshasa and then move supplies forward to Kisangani for displaced people.  UNICEF's Zaire director Steve Allen reported there are some 60,000 displaced persons at Lubutu, southeast of Kisangani, the vast majority of whom are probably Zaireans (AFP). He said they had probably walked up to 2-300 kilometers, some starting off in very poor condition. UNICEF wants to reactivate health clinics and centres in the area, where local staff try to continue work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid representatives in Nairobi say that despite the recent, limited moves into eastern Zaire, there is no indication of where the bulk of some 1.2 million refugees are. No satellite images have been made public; and concentrations of refugees in jungle and forest areas are invisible to aerial surveys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scores of French soldiers are reported to have arrived in Brazzaville, the Congolese capital, neighbouring Zaire. AFP reports they have been deployed in response to unrest in Kinshasa. AFP also reports that Congolese President Pascal Lissouba yesterday met the ailing President Mobutu of Zaire at his French Riviera villa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six trucks of supplies were brought in with the UN assessment mission to Goma yesterday for delivery to local hospitals. The UN convoys, along with those of NGOs were taken to the local stadium and obliged to remain there pending a meeting with a rebel &quot;technical committee&quot;. UN Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator Martin Griffiths, with the UN team and an NGO representative, talked to rebel spokesman Laurent Kabila about access and monitoring of distributions. UN officials emphasised to Kabila that humanitarian assistance in Eastern Zaire did not constitute recognition of the rebels, and said that there should be no rejection of international civil servants (UN staff) who have previously worked in the area. Since Friday, there have been reports that the rebels and the Rwandan Government were refusing access to personnel and some aid agencies who had previously worked in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second mission into Bukavu was composed of UNICEF, UNHCR, WFP and DHA, and met a representative of the ADFL. The UN team explained the need to do further assessment missions, and get guarantees from the ADFL on safety and access. The rebels are eager for supplies to get to local people and the internally displaced. UN missions are expected to try for cross-border access again today.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The ANC has noted a distorted report in the Star newspaper on President Nelson Mandela's briefing to the National Executive Committee meeting held over the weekend of 9-10 November in Johannesburg. The story is nothing but superficial sensationalism signifying not very much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC confirms that President Nelson Mandela did brief the National Executive Committee on the content of the interview he had conducted with the Sowetan. The interview appears in Monday 11 November edition of the newspaper.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this regard, the President had emphasised to the National Executive Committee old ANC policy that leaders are not anointed but elected by the National Conference of the organisation. It is a policy that has guided the movement throughout the years and which has the unequivocal support of Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having said so, the President went further to indicate that should the constitutional structures of the ANC elect deputy President Thabo Mbeki, the President would give such nomination his unqualified support. He would do so because he has confidence in Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's qualities as a leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 7 this year, President Mandela stated that it was not for him to designate a successor, but said he would support the ANC if it chose Mr.  Mbeki to succeed him. &quot;This is something that will be decided by the organisation but he (Mbeki) is a very talented and influential person. He is very popular and if the organisation elected him, I would feel they had made the correct decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed the Monday 11 November edition of the Sowetan states that the President reiterated that he would support the election of Deputy President Thabo Mbeki as his successor because he is &quot;a competent man who deserves that position (presidency)&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If anything, President Mandela at the meeting of the NEC reaffirmed his vote of confidence in the leadership abilities of Deputy President Mbeki in particular and the entire ANC collective leadership in general to pursue policies of reconstruction and development, reconciliation, peace and nation building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What President Mandela said to the NEC therefore was nothing new but merely reiterating what he said publicly before. What appears in the Star is a terrible reflection on the quality of the writer concerned. The ANC and President Mandela reiterates its view that ANC leaders are elected at duly constituted branch, provincial and national conferences.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Statement by the Western/Northern Cape Office of the Truth And Reconciliation Commission On Guguletu Seven-Event Hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nine current and former policeman from the Western Cape have been served subpoenas by the Western Cape Investigative Unit during the last 24 hours in terms of Section 29 of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act (1995). These are the first regional subpoenas served by the Western Cape office.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nine will be required to testify at a public Event Hearing on what is known as the Guguletu Seven to be held in Cape Town on 27 and 28 November.  The event hearing will make up the last two days of the three day hearings on human rights violations in the Peninsula to be held in the TRC Head Office from November 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of the subpoenas they are required to produce before the TRC such evidence as video and sound recordings in their possession which may be relevant to the hearing; and will be expected to give evidence and/or to answer questions relating to the Guguletu 7 issue. All nine are scheduled to testify on November 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven young men died, allegedly at the hands of police, on 3 March, 1986 in Guguletu. Two consecutive inquests cleared the police. They were also absolved from culpability during a trail brought against journalist, Tony Weaver, subsequent to the event. The TRC is currently notifying the families of the deceased and family members of at least five of the victims are expected to make statements at the hearing - amongst other witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first day of the hearing will be devoted to other cases of gross human rights violations in the Peninsula during the eighties, amongst others some cases relating to the Pollster March of August 1985, which resulted in upheavals inWestern Cape areas like Mitchell's Plain and Bishop Lavis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those subpoenaed are (with current ranks):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police director L. Knipe Senior Superintendent J. M.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Transcript of opening statements made at a news conference following a meeting between TRC and ANC delegations at Johannesburg international airport, Sunday November 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHERYL CAROLUS, DEPUTY SECRETARY-GENERAL, ANC:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We can say that we are very happy that whatever misunderstandings may have existed between the ANC and the Truth and Reconciliation have been cleared up.  We think that the meeting has been very helpful in that we have once again reaffirmed the independence of the Commission, the supremacy of the law of our country, and all of our commitment to in fact respect that independence of the Commission and to in fact ensure that the law around the TRC is one that becomes respected and implemented in our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also have assured the TRC that nothing which the ANC has said was meant to unduly influence the work of the Commission or to undermine it and that nothing which we have said had in any way implied that the ANC was granting itself indemnity. In fact the ANC used the opportunity today to clarify its own position and with regards to that we have once again reaffirmed to the Commission our own willingness to work to resolve the processes around the TRC; that we in fact have been engaged for months, and we believe we are probably the one party in the country which has done the most substantial work around the TRC.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have encouraged ANC people and members of the public to apply for amnesty in cases where it may be necessary. In fact the ANC has set up throughout the nine provinces sub-committees, working under the provincial executive committees and in consultation with the National Executive Committee, to assist people who may not be sure whether they were in the category who needed to apply for amnesty or not, to do that. We have in this meeting emerged with a very firm agreement that we need to encourage people to do that, and to utilise facilities of the TRC and the ANC for those people who may not be sure whether they should or should not apply, and to follow the procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are very mindful of the fact that the cut-off date for applications for amnesty is December 14, and we are very anxious that everybody needs to understand the implications of not applying for amnesty for those cases which they may have to by the cut-off date, and we have made a commitment that we would want to facilitate and assist people in making those applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have also noted that there is a lot confusion about two committees of the TRC, that is the work of the Amnesty Committee and the Committee on Human Rights Violations, and we think it is important that the work of those two committees must be understood so that these kinds of misunderstandings do not arise in the mind of the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The work of the Amnesty Committee is a legal process. It impacts on crimes, on charges, trial and sentences, and each application for amnesty must be treated -- will be treated -- and considered against the same criteria and in terms of the same procedure. In the case of the Amnesty Committee, even- handedness and treatment is implicit in the process and important, and amnesty is granted in respect of crimes and wrongs which have been committed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With regard to the work of the Human Rights Violations Committee, we believe here the processes envisaged are different from those of the Amnesty Committee. They do not have the same legal consequences as those of the Amnesty Committee and even-handedness here in this Committee is not an issue.  What is an issue here is questions of fairness, of justice, of human rights values, of standards and norms and morality, and that these are the guidelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of gross human rights violations is relevant to the work of the Human Rights Violations Committee, not to the work of the Amnesty Committee, and this committee has to have its eye on the future in terms of setting a new moral tone for our country. It has to record violations and identify the causes and overall it must make recommendations so that we go forward with a new kind of morality into our future. Its report, its finding and recommendations, have no legal consequences, unlike the finding of the Amnesty Committee. So we think we should understand, obviously, the two committees' work will have some overlap and will impact on one another but we think it's important to say that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But most of all we said that it was quite important for us as a collective, in this country's leadership -- in political parties, in the Truth Commission, in the judiciary, in all walks of life -- that we should be assisting people in our country to come to terms with our past. For that it is very important that those who have perpetrated gross human rights violations should come forward. It's a lso important that people need to understand what constitutes gross human rights violations. We are saying in that respect if there's any confusion all of us are quite willing to assist people are making those judgments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We want to say that we are very happy that our misunderstandings have been cleared up because the very last thing that we would want to do is to undermine the work or the integrity of the TRC. Its independence is important, as is ours, and we believe that we might have a whole range of questions to deal with still. The Truth Commission has asked the ANC to answer a range of questions flowing from its submission. The ANC had in fact already indicated in that submission that it would be making a further report on all our operations. The ANC had also indicated right in that report its intentio n to apply for amnesty where it is applicable in terms of the Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ARCHBISHOP TUTU, CHAIRPERSON OF THE TRC:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't think that there is a great more that one wants to say. We from the TRC's side are pleased that we have had this meeting to clarify what was a matter of very great concern to us. We are grateful first that this meeting helped to underscore the recognition on the part of the ANC of the Commission's independence, autonomy and its integrity, that the ANC would be very loath to have undermined that credibility by any suggestion of manipulation of the Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have agreed that when there are differences perhaps we should get in touch with one another before we deal with one another in the media, and that was maybe a salutary thing to have agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For me, and for us from the Commission, we were very deeply concerned that the way things came across to us was that the ANC was granting itself amnesty.  They say, as you have heard from Cheryl, that nothing in what they have said, that nothing in their own position, was meant to be a granting of amnesty to themselves, and therefore my reaction, whilst it was a reaction supported by the Commission, will now be revised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point is that there is an acceptance that those who should apply for amnesty are those who do not (want to) open themselves to criminal prosecution or civil damages being claimed against them. That it something that has been accepted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then the second (point) is the important one where Cheryl speaks about how it would be important to have a distinction in the two committees: that -- and this was another area where it appeared that we were at cross-purposes -- that in the amnesty process there is legal equivalence, and sometimes the impression was created that that was not the case. And that is important, it has been clarified that that is accepted. It is in other areas (that moral distinctions can be drawn). We think that it is legitimate and we've never questioned the right of the ANC to make pronouncements about the morality, and whether it is higher or lower, of their struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So I think on that basis we from the TRC are satisfied.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Communique issued by the fourth extraordinary session of the Central Organ of the OAU Mechanism For Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution at the Level of Ministers, Addis Ababa, 11 November 1996:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Central Organ of the OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and resolution, held, at the request of the Government of Algeria, its Fourth Extraordinary session today, 11 November 1996, at the Level of Ministers of Foreign Affairs. H.E. Mr. Ferdinand Leopold Oyono, Minister of External Relations of the Republic of Cameroon, chaired the Session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">H.E. Mr. Meles Zenawi, Prime Minister of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, addressed the Session on the outcome of the Nairobi Regional Summit on the crisis in eastern Zaire, held on 5 November 1996. The countries involved in the Arusha Peace Process including those of the Great Lakes Region, as well the other countries bordering Zaire, also attended the Meeting at the invitation of the Secretary General.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Session considered the Report of the Secretary General on the current crisis in the Great Lakes Region, with special reference to eastern Zaire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Central Organ:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. EXPRESSES its grave concern at the humanitarian tragedy unfolding in Eastern Zaire with its far reaching implications for peace, security and stability in the region and APPEALS for an immediate cessation of hostilities and for restraint;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. UNDERSCORES the urgent need to provide humanitarian relief and facilitate the voluntary return of the refugees to their countries of origin;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. FULLY SUPPORTS and ENDORSES the decisions and approach taken by the regional leaders at their meeting of 5th November 1996 in Nairobi on the crisis in Eastern Zaire. The Central Organ considers the Summit decisions as embodied in the Press Statement as a solid framework for defusing the crisis;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. EXPRESSES its commitment to the unity, cohesion and respect of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Zaire in accordance with the OAU Charter and in particular the Cairo Declaration of 1964 on territorial integrity and inviolability of national boundaries as inherited at independence. It also calls for non-intervention and an end to cross border incursions. The Central Organ reaffirmed the inalienable rights of all peoples within the internationally recognized territorial boundaries as stipulated in the OAU Charter on Human and People's Rights and other international Conventions relevant to the right of citizenship and nationality;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. UNDERSCORES the position that the setting up of a neutral Force as recommended by the Nairobi Summit would have been the most effective manner in facilitating the creation of safe corridors and temporary sanctuaries and ensuring an effective African contribution to such a Force. It regrets that the Security Council did not fully take into account this particular recommendation of the Nairobi Summit;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Nonetheless, given the decision by United Nations Security Council to create a multinational Force, the Central Organ CONSIDERS that African participation in such a Force is pivotal;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Given the resource constraints that would clearly face African contributors to the Force, the Central Organ UNDERSCORES the need for the Security Council and the International Community at large to create a Mechanism which would ensure an effective African participation. This means that financial, logistic and material resources should be provided on a very reliable, dependable and sustainable basis;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. On the understanding that resources would be made available, the Central Organ APPEALS to all the African countries in a position to do so, to contribute contingents to the proposed multinational Force;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. UNDERSCORES the need for clarity of the mandate of the proposed Force which should inter alia facilitate the provision of humanitarian relief assistance and return of the refugees to Rwanda. It also STRESSES the importance of the proposed Force being neutral. It URGES a speedy deployment of the Force and REQUESTS all parties concerned to extend maximum cooperation;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. REQUESTS the OAU Secretary General to enter into consultation with all concerned especially with the United Nations Secretary General with a view to ensuring an effective African participation in the Force;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Canada has offered to lead a multinational force in eastern Zaire, confirmed UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in a press conference in Rome today. He said that under Canadian command, the international force would have both the multinational and neutral dimension needed. According to the BBC, the UN Special Envoy, Canadian Raymond Chretien said a force could be in place within seven days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raymond Chretien, UN Special Envoy for the Great Lakes, said in a BBC interview that both Rwanda and Zaire had expressed a willingness for an intervention force, but that it was a &quot;huge endeavour&quot; that would go beyond the humanitarian sphere. Chretien expressed concern about the number of armed groups in eastern Zaire and said the intervention force would have to work out questions concerning &quot;rules of engagement&quot;. He said that such questions would not create further delay if the force was &quot;flexible&quot; and ready to adapt to the situation on the ground.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN Secretary General also confirmed that South Africa has agreed to participate in what will be their first commitment of troops in an international intervention force. Canada had previously offered troops at an informal meeting, but said more troops were needed - particularly from the United States. A US State Department spokesman yesterday denied reports that the US was blocking the creation of an international force, but said no &quot; coherent plan&quot; was yet available. AFP reported today that a delegation of US Agency for International Development (USAID) crossed into Bukavu, eastern Zaire, today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A UN team spent most of the day negotiating with rebel leaders in Goma to seek agreements on a number of issues relating to the restarting of humanitarian operations. Other negotiations were being pursued by Humanitarian Coordinator Vieira de Mello in Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four African foreign ministers plan to fly to France tomorrow to talk with Zairean President Mobutu, Kenyan Foreign Minister Kalonzo Musyoka said in Nairobi today. On November 5, the Nairobi summit said four African diplomats would travel to Kinshasa to attempt to persuade the Zairean government to accept the resolutions of the Nairobi summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Organisation of African Unity yesterday issued a communique calling for the setting up of an intervention force as recommended by the Nairobi summit (November 5), and stressing the importance of neutrality, and urging speedy deployment. The OAU Central Organ for conflict prevention said that African participation in such a force is &quot;pivotal&quot;. According to the statement &quot;the Central Organ underscores the need for the Security Council and the international commmunity at large to create a mechanism which would ensure an effective African participation.&quot; Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia said at the opening of the OAU summit yesterday that it is difficult for resource-poor African nations to participate if a multi-national force is to be paid for by the participants and through voluntary contributions, as recommended by the UN Security Council. His views expressed a concern voiced by other African leaders and commentators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid workers say there are &quot;hundreds&quot; of soldiers congregating in Bunia, and local personnel describe it as &quot;not very safe&quot;. IRIN was told of shelling at Adi north of Bunia, and missionaries evacuating staff today. Fleeing, looting soldiers are also reported to be a problem in the Beni area. Fighting reported in Bunia is now attributed to competing groups of fleeing Zairean soldiers. A plane was reportedly sent to Bunia to pick up some of the soldiers fleeing from the front, and accompanying family members. There has been one flight known to have ferried soldiers from Bunia to Kisangani. Some soldiers have apparently refused to leave as they fear being sent back to fight - underlining reports of a demoralised army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reuters reported two nights of shooting and looting in Kisangani on Friday and Saturday, and said the local military commander warned troops from the warfront on Sunday that if they carried weapons on the street they would be shot. The New York Times reported two other groups of Zairean troops had hijacked river barges and made their way towards Kinshasa, terrorizing towns on the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fleeing Zairean soldiers from the Goma area have moved southwest to Minova on the western shore of the lake. Local aid staff have reported that the retreating soldiers took wives, children and other civilians from Goma to Minova. TMK airline moved a fleet of about 5 aircraft from out of Minova two days ago to Entebbe, Uganda, because of the threatening presence of Zairean soldiers. A British pilot who met with a retreating contingent in Minova on Sunday was held hostage and threatened with execution, but escaped in remaining aircraft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two reliable sources told IRIN that areas between Sake and the northern side of Bukavu - outside the town - are insecure, with continued fighting.  Sources also say that heavily armed Hutu extremists (Interahamwe and former Rwandan forces) are believed to have moved further into the interior from Mugunga camp. It remains unclear whether those remaining in the camp include armed elements. Anti-refugee sentiment is reported to be high among local Zaireans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an article in The Times (UK), Sam Kiley reports finding &quot;the charred bones of several Zairean women and children coated with molten plastic from the roof...where they were burnt alive by the Interahamwe ... in the Katale maternity clinic&quot;. One journalist who visited the abandonded camps on the Goma northern axis, said they had found &quot;very little&quot;. Some journalists, like Kiley, yesterday were able to travel up to twenty kilometres outside Goma town. There is still no access west, towards Mugunga camp. Kiley writes in The Times that shelling from the direction of Mugunga camp towards Goma town has been &quot;a daily occurence at about 6pm&quot;. He attributes the bombardments to Hutu militia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concern increases over the effect of the eastern Zaire conflict on Burundi, which is still gripped by regional sanctions since the July coup. The Third Arusha Regional Summit, on 14 October 1996, said all parties to the conflict in Burundi should make a start on a negotiated settlement within a period of a month - a deadline which ran out today, without any visible progress made.  The Arusha summit said it would take further measures against Burundian factions if they refused to participate in the negotiations. The next Arusha Summit is expected to meet on Thursday November 14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation in Burundi has deteriorated because of the eastern Zaire crisis; but Burundi has not been invited to participate in regional talks.  One NGO said that Burundi is now &quot;as bad as it's ever been&quot;. There has been an upsurge of fighting and violence in Burundi, which may be related to the fact that fighters who used to be based in and around the refugee camps in Uvira, eastern Zaire, are coming back into Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A UNHCR nutritionist told IRIN that refugees in the Uvira camps had been in poorer shape than other refugees in eastern Zaire before the conflict broke out. Good nutritional indicators were reported in other camps in Goma and Bukavu, but Burundian refugees could now be one of the most vulnerable groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kigoma, since November 7, refugee figures are: 7,252 Zaireans; 2,332 Burundians; 40 Tanzanians (who had been residing in eastern Zaire), 455 Rwandans; and 1 Kenyan. The 2,332 Burundian refugees include six members of parliament. About half of these refugees (total 10,040) are at the Ministry of Home Affairs holding centre and half are in the Kigoma football stadium.  Reports say they arrived in reasonable condition, but 8 were treated for gunshot wounds.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Question and answers by spokesman Michael McCurry at the daily White House press briefing on November 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q When do you expect the President to make an announcement on whether the U.S. should be involved in helping the people in Zaire?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: I expect the President to review the recommendations that come to him from his senior foreign policy advisors, and they are actively and urgently reviewing that question in consultation with other governments that are also deeply concerned about the humanitarian plight of refugees from East Rwanda who are now in Zaire or crossing back and forth between the border.  And the President will clearly be consulting, as he indicated to members of Congress, with the congressional leadership about any unique role that the United States might have in a mission.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again, the President always is concerned about the nature of any mission -- is it well defined, is it well coordinated, are there clear lines of authority with those who would participate in such a force. All of those questions are those being urgently reviewed, even at this moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q So when do you think there will be a decision?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: When there's good grounds to know that you've got the right decision in hand, and we don't have it yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q What about the French criticism, Mike? Does that lend any urgency to the situation?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: No. I mean, the French have a historic involvement in that continent, but the French are among many nations that are deeply concerned and worried and have been active in their diplomacy, as has been our government. We have devoted considerable work, including the consultations of a special envoy to the issue of how we can limit the fighting between people on both sides of the border. And that diplomatic work must continue, but the urgent question now facing the world community is what to do about the likelihood of a humanitarian catastrophe. And that is the one that the President's senior foreign policy advisors have been addressing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Is there any sort of peacekeeping, peacemaking role, or would it simply -- would U.S. troops simply be involved in a humanitarian effort?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: Well, I'm not speculating on what U.S. troops &quot;might&quot; do.  There is a desire by the international community to assist those who have been doing a heroic effort of trying to provide humanitarian relief. The security situation right now for those who are involved in that effort has been in recent days desperate. There has been some indications that the situation might be opening up somewhat in the last 24 hours, but we continue to explore with others in the world community and through the United Nations, through UNACR and other effected agencies how best to address the humanitarian situation and also the underlying security concerns that have been there and have been the subject of considerable diplomacy over the last several months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Is there some timetable that the President has asked his advisors to work against?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: He's asked them to address the matter urgently and they are doing so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Would you expect they would have some recommendations by the end of the day or tomorrow or --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: I'm not going to speculate. They will work it urgently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Mike, what are the active involvements that are under consideration?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: I'm not going to detail for you what plans are being reviewed.  There are those -- there are a number of governments that have suggested different configurations and types of missions, and some of those, frankly, are contradictory and they need to be resolved, reconciled, all of those countries that have an interest to participate need to put their efforts together and address the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Would this be under the aegis of the U.N. or who or what?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: UNACR is currently -- they are the U.N. humanitarian office -- High Commissioner of Refugees has been addressing it because there are a million-plus refugees now that have been affected by the fighting. So the U.N.  has been playing a role and has been largely humanitarian. The suggestions that there be some type of security provided to that humanitarian relief effort has come principally from the French. There have been some suggestions from the Canadians that there is a way to structure the force. We have deliberated at the United Nations about how best to address the security needs of the humanitarian relief workers, and we are continuing to address that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q That's what this is about, is the security needs of humanitarian relief efforts?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: The people who are going to provide -- the most urgent situation there is humanitarian. The likelihood of famine, cholera, dehydration -- that is clearly the most urgent and pressing concern. There are ways in which those providing relief believe they can address that, but they've been concerned about the ongoing fighting between the tribal factions there that jeopardizes the provision of that aid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Text of questions and answers by Glyn Davies at the department's regular news briefing on November 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Do you have anything to say about the announcement this morning by Boutros-Ghali to the effect that a Canadian-led force between 10-20,000 is being formed to go to the region? Have you heard --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DAVIES: I don't. I mean, you can ask the Canadians to comment on that.  I can tell you that we're very aware of the Canadian idea. We are in discussion with the Canadians intensively in more than one venue about their proposal. What we have are a number of proposals, including the Canadian proposal, that are out there. What's important to do now is to look at all of these proposals -- in fact, this is being done; it's being done intensively; it was done intensively over the weekend -- and to figure out from the ideas that are out there what ideas from the standpoint of the United States will work and then to make some fundamental decisions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, no one is more mindful of the need to get all of this figured out and decided than is the United States, which has done a great deal in recent years to help stem the humanitarian crisis in eastern Zaire, which recognizes fully that we're facing a real crisis today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Glyn, are you saying that the United States has agreed in principle to participate in an intervention force but just not how?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DAVIES: I'm not saying that. No, I'm saying that we are in terms of crossing that line and actually letting you all know about what it is the United States can do and plans to do -- we're not across that line yet. The intensive work continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So I don't have any announcement for you on exactly what will unfold in coming days, and I would simply say stay tuned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Then what is the assessment team doing in the region?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DAVIES: Just that. They're taking a look at conditions on the ground.  You have, for instance, a number of airfields in the region; they are all in the hands of Tutsi rebels. This is not a clean, permissive environment that we're talking about here -- there's no secret about that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You have a number of different militias and ethnic groups who are in the field. You have, of course, the refugees themselves, and you have interspersed among the refugees rutilated throughout their numbers individuals who are of interest to governments in the region for some of their past activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a very complicated, very complex situation, and the essence of it for the United States is deciding what makes sense to do, what can we do, and then to make a decision whether or not to go ahead and do that. That decision has yet to be made. But you have the interplay of a number of factors that you don't normally have in a humanitarian crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: What's the composition of this team? What buildings do they come from?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DAVIES: I don't have specifics on it. We can perhaps get you specifics on it, but I think it's safe to say that they're both military and civilian members of the team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Glyn, last week Nick was saying that U.S. ground forces would not be used. Over the weekend, General Shalikashvili said that he didn't think that we should rule out the use of U.S. ground forces in getting this humanitarian aid to people. Would you agree with that? Is that -- where is the thinking of the U.S. Government on the use of ground troops?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DAVIES: That would get me right into answering the questions that are right now at this moment unanswerable, which have to do with what is it that the United States is looking at doing, what could it do, in conjunction with the rest of the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think it's very important to keep looking at this crisis and at the response to it in an international context -- in the context of an effort that won't be a unilateral U.S. effort. It will be an effort on the part of a number of nations -- certainly the nations in the region, as well as Europeans, Canadians and Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, as I say, since no decisions have been made, what I don't want to do is open up a window on the discussions and thinking in the U.S. Government, because all that will do is serve to box us and slow us down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: But this controversy has been -- I mean, this situation has existed for awhile. I mean, what do you need in order to make a decision?  There are people dying. I mean, when is this government going to act?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DAVIES: This government has been second to none in the last three or four days in burning the midnight oil. Many officials have gone with very little sleep. The meetings have gone on over the weekend. U.S. officials are seized of the necessity to, in examining this crisis, figure out what is best for the United States to do. There are a number of very serious, very live options, some of which come from within the United States Government; some from others, and the challenge is putting the various components together so that you actually have something that can go into that very remote mountainous part of the world and work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's the challenge. That's the puzzle, if you will. Putting together something that will work, that will take best advantage of what the various players can bring to the mission. It's not simply a question of parachuting in foodstuffs or water to people, because in this situation, unlike other situations, we're not even sure where the people are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I mean, we have some ideas, and we have some clues, and we have some reports. But you have to figure out a way to go in there, first to get the people together, but to do so in a way that doesn't return us to the status quo ante; that gets us to a situation where the people can get moving back where it's ultimately safe for them to be, i.e., Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: But the Canadian Government has made a commitment to do something and did publicly, and this government still seems to be --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DAVIES: Look, I'm not in the business of characterizing the Canadian position on this. But I think one thing that's fair to say about this crisis - - you can correct me if I'm wrong; you've collectively read more of the press than I have one this -- is that all of the governments talking about plans to resolve the crisis indicate that the United States is an important part of this from their standpoint; and that U.S. thinking, perhaps U.S. support, is a key to all of this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Have you set yourselves a deadline? People are dying, we assume, and possibly in fairly large numbers. Is there a deadline that the U.S. sets itself by which it should make a decision on all these matters?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DAVIES: The deadline can be summed up in that old bureaucratic acronym, ASAP -- &quot;as soon as possible.&quot; As soon as there is something that works, that makes sense, and that we can make some decisions on, we will do so. Those decisions I would look for in the near term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what I don't want to do is complicate the situation further by putting out all kinds of promissory notes or statements about what the United States is thinking prospectively, because all that's going to do is get us boxed and cross-ways with all the various actors out there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Glyn, is there anything that's been ruled out?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DAVIES: I don't have anything to report to you that's been ruled out.  Again, what I don't want to do is narrow the focus of policymakers who are looking at all options and refining them right now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: But Nick ruled out ground troops last week. He ruled them out last week, and you're --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DAVIES: Nick was asked that question on Friday, and Nick addressed it.  I stand by what Nick had to say in response to the very same challenging tone that he got on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Is the United States hoping the a cease-fire can be worked out that would obviate the need for some sort of military intervention? Is that what you're working for? Is that your goal?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DAVIES: One of the problems with this situation is being able to identify and get to those who are controlling the shooters, the militias, who are active in the region, so that you can even discuss something like that.  This is not the European battlefield in 1918. It's not as if the General Command on one side sends up a balloon or a flag or a telegraph message and all is quiet on the front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is eastern Zaire. This is the part of the world that brought you the Simba uprising of the early 60s. You can go back and look at your history of the taking of the American Consulate General in Kisangani 30 years ago.  There's a long history in that part of the world that involves the ethnic groups, it involves the actual governments in the region; it has to do with what is happening now in Kinshasa and Kigali as well as in capitals in Europe, Canada and the United States. It's a very, very complex situation that has to be done right if it's going to be done at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: But there must be some point at which you decide -- I mean, the perfect becomes the enemy of the good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DAVIES: No, no. No government has greater experience in handling humanitarian disasters and crises than does the United States Government, and frankly that's part of why the United States Government is hunkering down behind folks like me at podiums and doing its work and is not out there floating options, trial balloons -- we're going to do this, we're going to do that -- and that's all well and good, and that's fine, and these are important ideas that are being advanced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we are attempting to integrate it from the standpoint of the United States and what we could bring to bear on this situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Mr. Davies, when you were answering George's question about the Canadians, you said you are talking to the Canadians, and you're coming up with their proposal, and that doesn't mention the Secretary General of the United Nations. Are you discussing the situation with him closely, and how much of your conflict with him is affecting any progress on this?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DAVIES: First of all, we don't have a conflict with Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary General of the United Nations. Second of all, throughout the entire issue of a successor to Boutros-Ghali, the United States and the United Nations -- specifically the Office of the Secretary General of the United Nations -- have done excellent work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We're big enough, I think on both sides, that some of the positions taken by the United States have not affected the work-a-day world of UN diplomacy, the work of the United Nations and the interplay between Washington and New York. So that I would sort of reject one of your premises there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of work at the United Nations, we're absolutely engaged at the UN The UN is one of the best places in the world to do work on an issue like this, that involves so many international actors, that involves even in the region so many different players. The French called the UN the &quot;Maison de Mot, &quot; the house of words. It's the greatest place to exchange ideas and words there is, so we're active there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we're also active in Ottawa. We're active in Washington. We're active in European capitals, and we're very active, as I described, in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Is the United States hinging its participation in whatever is decided on, on the Rwandan Government's willingness to accept all the refugees and to guarantee their safety?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DAVIES: An important part of this challenge to the international community is ensuring that a component of whatever solution is arrived at is repatriation of refugees. If the international community even were able to perform the miracle of reassembling these million or so refugees in a number of camps, you would then be faced with the same problems that we had, that the world had, of militias marauding at war with each other, at war with Zairian troops, with Rwandans and the rest of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So you have to untangle that ball of twine at the same time you get at the humanitarian end of it. They can't be separated. You can't simply air drop C rations or MREs, as they're called, in there and hope it all gets solved. You have 300 miles of jungle between Kisangani and the Kivus, and reports are that a number of the refugees are scattered in that region. So it's a very, very complex problem that we're facing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: The answer then is yes?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DAVIES: Give me the question again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: The United States will not participate, whatever this mission becomes, unless part of the package is repatriation of all the Hutus refugees and assurances from --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DAVIES: We believe very strongly that repatriation of refugees has got to be in the mix as we move forward here, and there has to be -- we've got to be further along -- and we can't simply go in there without a plan for dealing with repatriation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: The UNHCR has said that they are going to airlift some supplies into Kinshasa, and then truck stuff closer to --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DAVIES: You can't truck things from Kinshasa to the Kivu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Well, that they were going to truck it to Kisangani?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DAVIES: The only way I think it could work -- and here are my two years' experience in that part of the world helps me a bit -- is you'd have to take it by riverboat to Kisangani and then cross 300 miles of jungle --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Sure, it's not easy, but they say that this is something they're going to do; it's something that's going to go in today and something in tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DAVIES: I can't speak on that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: The U.S. is not a part of this operation?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DAVIES: I'm sure we're very much involved in it, but I can't speak for them. You're asking logistical questions about how they're going to move equipment, supplies, foodstuffs in there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: No, I'm asking if the U.S. is going to participate in this airlift.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DAVIES: I can check that. You heard the announcement that Nick made at the end of last week about some of the aid that we're providing to alleviate the problem in eastern Zaire. I imagine that we are involved in this effort, but that's something I can check specifically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Can you say what you're seeking from the Zairian Government? I mean, they've been of mixed cooperation with the UN I gather they've blocked a flight to Kisangani, and various things are coming out of Kinshasha. What do you want from them in order to agree to some kind of an intervention?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DAVIES: Again, in a way you're simplifying it as if we've got demands or questions that are abroad in the world, and we have to get certain responses to these questions for us to make decisions and do things. But putting that aside, I think what's fair to say about the Zairians is we're looking for them to play a constructive role in the Kivus for Zairian troops to participate in any cease-fires that are arranged and for the Zairian Government not to lay down difficult requirements on the international community in terms of getting relief to those in need in the Kivus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's up to UNHCR and the NGOs to decide how best to get this aid out there.  It shouldn't be up to governments from a political standpoint to dictate how that aid moves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Go back to the question of the Hutu refugees, upwards of a million. You're proposing that all of them go back to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DAVIES: No.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Okay, well, let me just -- many of these people are alleged war criminals -- allegedly participated in genocide. I mean, there's a million of them. Our policy, I understand, is not to forcibly repatriate refugees. Are you seeking some sort of amnesty for these people from the Rwandan Government? What guarantees -- can you offer to -- why would you offer guarantees --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DAVIES: Actually, you're helping me out here, because you're helping explain some of the complexities that are confronting the international community here. The United States doesn't want to be in the business, and I think most of the international community would agree, of forcing people to go where they don't want to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So to a great extent, what has to happen is these Rwandan Hutus -- most of them have to be convinced that it is safe to return to Rwanda. That is yet another tough part of this problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I didn't say that all Rwandans should be trucked back across the border to Rwanda. People have to be convinced it's safe to go back or they're ultimately not going to go back. You can't force a million people to do what they don't want to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: How about those who are suspected of war crimes? What happens to them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DAVIES: That's an important issue. That's absolutely an important issue, and those who are being sought by the Rwandan War Crimes Tribunal ultimately must be brought to the bar of justice so that they can face the judicial music. It's one of the wheels within the wheels that is very, very important.  You have to have it straight before you get the whole thing rolling, in a sense, or at least know in what direction you're moving. But I don't have any magic answers for you here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: You were speaking of the American experiences in the past. Would it be correct to infer that one of the unspoken goals of the U.S. Government at this point is to avoid another Somalian type situation, where chaos and anarchy are the real enemies?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DAVIES: I think what's fair to say -- comparing situations is always dangerous, and I don't think you can compare Somalia to eastern Zaire with any degree of safety or accuracy. But we did learn from Somalia -- we learned some lessons, and one of them is that you have to be awfully certain when you go into something this big, this complicated, this potentially dangerous, that you know what you're getting into. You have a plan for dealing with it.  You have some conception of an outcome that you'd like to see, and you have some conception of how it's all going to end for you as well. In other words, getting in is fine and important, but you have to get out eventually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: One of the problems with such caution is that the train is leaving. One way or another there is going to be some sort of international operation with or without the United States. And at this point if caution is the main watchword in the U.S. Government, then it's going to be without the United States, is it not?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DAVIES: I wouldn't look for that outcome, Jim. I just wouldn't look for that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QUESTION: Le Monde reports this morning that one of the possibilities for the United States is airport security at Goma and Bukavu. I know you're not going to confirm that, but can you say whether that's one of the possibilities?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. DAVIES: There are any number of possibilities, but again I'm not a military planner. The plan doesn't yet have the sealing wax and seal on it.  The plan hasn't even been approved. So I don't want to get into whether we're going to be operating at airfields, whether we're going to help secure the humanitarian routes, whether we'll fly, drive. I mean, all of that is up to others to parse out.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Statement by spokesman Glyn Davies at the department's regular news briefing on November 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, to the topic that's on most people's minds right now, which is Zaire.  Just to let you know where we stand in the process of looking at how the international community should and could respond to the ongoing crisis in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is an emerging international consensus that humanitarian intervention will be necessary to address the crisis in eastern Zaire. There's also an emerging consensus that in order to be effective, a humanitarian intervention will require some sort of security component, so the United States is today actively studying what type of security component would be necessary for such an intervention.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are also actively studying what role the United States could play as part of such a security component. Our objectives remain, as they have in recent days, twofold here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are first off to find a way to address the immediate humanitarian needs of the refugees and the inhabitants of eastern Zaire who are affected by this crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, to encourage the maximum number of refugees to return home, and for the most part, of course, this means returning Hutu refugees to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is the United States doing today about all of this. A U.S.  humanitarian assessment team is expected to leave for the region shortly, and I think the Pentagon might have a little further on that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USAID's Disaster Assistance Response Team, the so-called &quot;DART&quot; team, which is today in Rwanda, is attempting to cross into eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also diplomatic initiatives underway, a number of them. In the early hours of Saturday morning, the UN Security Council passed a resolution calling on member states to plan for an international force in eastern Zaire.  Following that action, the OAU held an extraordinary ministerial session in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have in the region two officials. We've spoken about their activities before, but Ambassador Bogosian was in Kigali yesterday to coordinate mutual efforts in the region. On Sunday, he met with officials to help facilitate emergency humanitarian border crossing arrangements for non-governmental organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday, Monday, in Addis Ababa, Howard Wolpe, our Special Envoy, met with the Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity, Salim Salim, and he stressed U.S. Government efforts to support a neutral humanitarian intervention force as envisioned at the Nairobi summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the international scene, of course, a number of NGOs and international groups are very active. A team from UNHCR and the World Food Program and UNICEF, altogether, crossed in a six-truck convoy into Goma yesterday to assess humanitarian needs, and they delivered some initial emergency supplies.  We understand that an NGO team also crossed into Goma with supplies yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These were the first humanitarian officials to go in since the last aid workers withdrew on November 2. UNHCR took with them, of course, 13 tons of biscuits. They also took blankets and plastic sheeting. They report that Goma appears relatively quiet, though there was one explosion that they heard, and they're witnessing a fair amount of looting. Only about one-third of the population of Goma remains in Goma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second UNHCR-led team crossed the border from Cyangugu in Rwanda on foot for a two-hour visit to Bukavu. They were not permitted to take relief supplies with them. They planned to go back in today. We don't have a report of their efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of the whereabouts of the refugees: Until the international community is able to gain access to the camps and get on the ground more fully in the region, it's difficult to know how many refugees are left in the camps -- we've all seen varying reports of numbers of refugees in the camps -- or to assess how many have fled further west into Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of the food situation in Zaire, the UN team which went into Goma yesterday was told that food and other humanitarian assistance was urgently needed in Goma for both the townspeople and for the refugees in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is sufficient food and other humanitarian supplies available in the region for an immediate response. The key is getting the food to the people and arranging that access.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So our hope remains that the parties to the conflict will agree to an effective cease-fire and allow the international community immediate access to the refugees as well as to Zairians displaced by the fighting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA -- Speaking at an emergency meeting of the Conflict Resolution Mechanism of the Organization of Africa Unity (OAU) in Addis Ababa yesterday, Amnesty International's Secretary General Pierre Sane called on participating governments to put human rights at the top of the agenda in any resolution on the crisis in the Great Lakes region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The humanitarian emergency and the urgent need for a political settlement should not deflect attention from the human rights crisis in the region,' said Mr Sane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The mortal risk at which millions of people in Zaire, Rwanda and Burundi find themselves is the result not only of the fighting which broke out in eastern Zaire in September 1996, but also more fundamentally, of the legacy of widespread human rights violations and impunity in the region.'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter addressed to members of the OAU Central Organ for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution, Mr Sane urged Member States to address the human rights dimension which, in the view of the organization, lies at the heart of the current crisis in the Great Lakes region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Attempts to induce, persuade or pressure refugees to return to their home countries are likely to result in a further serious escalation of human rights abuses if measures are not first introduced to ensure effective protection of human rights,' said Mr Sane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These should include ending 'disappearances', unlawful executions, and arbitrary arrests in both Burundi and Rwanda as well as deliberate and arbitrary killings by the armed opposition groups in these two countries.  There must be independent judicial systems functioning in each country to ensure impartial and effective investigations into human rights abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Unless human rights protection in the country of origin is made fully effective refugees cannot be expected to return voluntarily,' said Mr Sane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the United Nations (UN) resolution 1078 adopted by the UN Security Council on 9 November 1996, it was decided that a multi-national force, to be funded by participating states and voluntary contributions, will be deployed in the region as opposed to a UN peace-keeping force. This resolution does not specifically mention prevention of human rights violations as one of the forces's functions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Human rights protection is an international obligation for all members of the United Nations and cannot be left to voluntary initiatives. Otherwise we are again left to wonder whether the international community really cares about human rights in Africa or is only concerned to be seen to contain humanitarian crises,' said Mr Sane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Sane, who is travelling to Kigali, Rwanda, attended the opening of the Ministerial session of the OAU Central Organ for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution, and met with the OAU Secretary General, Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim, to present Amnesty International's recommendations regarding the resolution of the crisis in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He denied there were over 50,000 names missing from the voters roll saying there were no such numbers as purported by the independent media.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chiluba said Zambia enjoyed a certain measure of support from the donor community and that elections would go ahead as scheduled on November 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Zambia was an independent sovereign state which had gone to the people to find out exactly what they wanted included in the constitution and government did just that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no way we are going to change the election dates to suit the aspirations of opposition parties,&quot; said Mr Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is accompanied by Foreign Affairs Minister, Lt-General Christon Tembo, the Attorney General, George Chilupe and Secretary to the Cabinet Aldridge Adamson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his own comments Minister Tembo said most members of the international donor community felt the political situation pertaining in Zambia was an internal matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that he held random meetings with the donors at which most of them indicated that they would support Zambia in its efforts to maintain democractic governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gen Tembo said the campaign by opposition UNIP to derail the November 18 presidential and general elections was a waste of time as the country had reached a point of no return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said something could have been done if nominations were not filed but it was too late to change things now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had visited countries in West and North Africa which were in support of democratic changes taking place in Zambia and were willing to learn from us.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The London-based human rights group, Amnesty International and a Zimbabwean pressure group, Sangano Munhumutapa, condemned Tuesday the police beating and teargassing of more than 200 people who had gathered Monday in Harare in support of striking doctors and nurses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International said the police action showed the Zimbabwean government's inability to tolerate dissenting voices.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Human rights do not appear to be faring well in Zimbabwe when nurses, students and concerned citizens are teargassed and hit with batons simply for protesting against government policy,&quot; said the organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Union had its secretary-general, Morgan Tsvangirai, and three others briefly detained for spearheading the demonstration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sangano Munhumutapa president Warlord Chakaredza said the police displayed &quot; arrogance and brutality&quot; which only helped erode the image of Zimbabwe as a democratic nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a naked violation of human and constitutional rights...As we solidly support the striking nurses and doctors, we are calling upon the entire civic society to mobilize for a national strike,&quot; said Chakaredza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nurses and doctors have been on strike for 22 days, demanding higher pay and allowances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strike has paralysed operations at the country's four largest hospitals in the capital, Harare, and Zimbabwe's second city, Bulawayo, and other major hospitals have virtually been closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has since fired over 800 nurses and 100 junior doctors.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The government's invitation to foreign doctors and nurses to apply for positions left by dismissed striking junior doctors and nurses has had no takers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources in the ministry of health and child welfare, Parirenyatwa and Harare central hospitals told the Zimbabwe Inter-African News Agency on Tuesday that they had not received applications to replace nearly 2,000 nurses and 232 junior doctors who were fired for engaging in the three-week strike that has crippled health services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government started advertising last week vacant posts for nurses dismissed two weeks ago for defying a government order to resume work by Oct.  30.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advertisements have also been placed in South Africa, Britain and a number of African countries. Locally interested people were asked to submit their applications at the hospitals in writing or in person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vacancies were at Harare Central, Parirenyatwa, Chitungwiza General and Marondera Provincial hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 800 of the 2,000 striking nurses and two of 232 junior doctors have received their dismissal letters so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One senior official at Harare Central Hospital said: &quot;To tell you the truth, we have not received any application letters so far. Where are they going to get nurses and doctors to replace those that they fired?.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you think a doctor or nurse in South Africa and Britain would be willing to come here because there is a crisis, which was as a result of a strike by nurses and doctors who are pressing for better working conditions and salaries?.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe's health delivery system was plunged into a crisis 22 days ago when nurses went on strike to press demands for increased night duty allowance, an introduction of a risk allowance, as well as general improvement of conditions of service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The work stoppage paralysed the health institutions, forcing the closure of two of Zimbabwe's major referral hospitals, Harare Central and Parirenyatwa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ROME, Italy (PANA) - Canada has offered to lead a multinational force to provide security for the resumption of humanitarian aid to over a million refugees caught in fighting in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a news conference Tuesday in Rome, U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said the troops, to number about 10,000, would also protect airfields so that medical and food aid can be flown in.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the next few days we will have a large force put together,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exact date of deployment is still being discussed as well as the exact number and composition of the troops expected from 12 countries. However, Boutros-Ghali said the troop strength would likely number between 10,000 and 12,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the force will come from Africa, France, Italy, and Spain. The United States will provide logistics. He said that after speaking with President Nelson Mandela recently, the South African leader had also accepted &quot;in principle&quot; his country's participation in the multinational force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said a South African team has been sent to eastern Zaire to assess the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Boutros-Ghali said that the Organization of African Unity has given backing to the deployment of the force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko has supported the deployment of such a force but Rwanda has said it is against the presence of troops from France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No timetable has yet been set for the duration of the operation, but Boutros-Ghali said at the end of its operation, &quot;the United Nations forces will take over.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Nelson Mandela confirmed Monday night in an interview on South African national television that he was prepared in principle to contribute troops to such a multinational force, but that he had not decided on the size of such a unit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African leader, who had previously resisted the idea of military intervention in African crises -- confirmed that he had made such a commitment to former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere -- who was in South Africa last weekend to discuss ways and means of attempting to end the crisis in the Great Lakes Region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela insisted, however, that he would first send a top-level delegation - - headed by the ministry of foreign affairs -- to Zaire for a detailed assessment of the situation there. Only when this team reports back would he be in a position to make a decision on the size of the South African component for such a force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was also adamant that any such action would need the sanction of regional organizations such as the Organization of African Unity and the Southern African Development Community.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Air Zimbabwe Corporation has suspended at least 35 engineers indefinitely for allegedly refusing to carry out maintenance work on a Boeing 707 which was to be used by President Robert Mugabe on his trip to the World Food Summit in Rome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The engineers, who are denying the allegations, were served with letters of suspension on Monday, signed by Adonisi Matikiti, acting senior manager for maintenance and overhaul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the letters read: &quot;this is to advise that you are suspended from duty with immediate effect with full benefits. This is to allow investigations regarding your assigned work which you were supposed to carry out on B707-Z-WKU on Friday 8 November 1996. The aircraft was supposed to be prepared for the VIP presidential flight.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The engineers were also instructed not to report to their work place and to stay at home at all times to facilitate investigations, a move described by the engineers as tantamount to house arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They defied the order and they were on Tuesday barred from entering Air Zimbabwe headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the engineers alleged they were away on duty in Bulawayo during the time they were said to have refused to do the work, while the rest alleged they carried out maintenance work, but only refused to work overtime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we refused to work overtime, the acting managing director instructed the acting foreman, a Zambian expatriate, to write all the names of engineers in the maintenance department,&quot; they alleged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He then mobilized three more Zambians to finish the maintenance (work),&quot; they further alleged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimbabwe Aircraft Maintenance Engineers Association (ZAMEA) said the move was an attempt to victimize the engineers for embarking on a go-slow to press for better salaries and working conditions, a move which paralysed the national airline for about two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an attempt to thwart the current negotiations on their demands,&quot; it alleged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZAMEA said Air Zimbabwe could not operate without the suspended engineers and it was going to appeal to engineers to stop servicing Air Zimbabwe aircraft worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Air Zimbabwe senior public relations manager David Mwenga said he was not aware of the suspensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Air Zimbabwe technicians in October went on a two-week go-slow over salaries, resulting in four aircraft -- half of the airline's fleet -- being grounded.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media reports Monday claimed Mandela had dropped a bombshell at the weekend, telling the ANC national executive committee and newspaper correspondents that he did not endorse Mbeki as the next leader.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC pointed out Monday night that Mandela had simply emphasized that it was not up to him alone to choose a new leader -- that was the prerogative of the national executive committee of his party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On South African national television Monday night, the South African leader said he would welcome the choice of Mbeki if he were elected as his successor, but re-emphasized that it was not his job to choose who filled his shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the organization elected Thabo Mbeki, I would fully support that,&quot; he said. &quot;He is highly capable, smart, influential and committed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbeki is currently on an eight-nation tour in Europe, aimed at attracting and increasing more foreign trade with and investment in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tour is seen here as the latest in a series of high-profile foreign trips helping to groom him for his eventual succession as head of the ANC and president of the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ROME, Italy (PANA) - The World Food Summit began in Rome on Wednesday with calls on world leaders to re-dedicate themselves to ensuring the availability of affordable and adequate food to all the world's six billion people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of particular concern to the more than 100 heads of state and government attending the five-day summit is growing starvation in a world where food production has been growing, but in cash crop form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are more than 840 million people afflicted by hunger in the world, 300 million of whom are in Africa and 200 million are children under the age of five years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These figures are expected to either remain the same or double within the next 20 years when world population is expected to rise to about nine billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officially opening the summit, Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro said the meeting should come up with concrete plans to protect the &quot;natural human right of freedom from hunger&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is unacceptable to have some hungry people in our countries. We as leaders should strive to stop the spread of hunger,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He implored the United Nations to be more responsive to people's needs and the Security Council to be serious in solving international and civil conflicts which were closely related to hunger, particularly in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The UN was created to serve all people. It should ensure peace for nations to focus on development,&quot; said Scalfaro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit is already being billed as the most important gathering of heads of state and government because it seeks to ensure the most basic human right - freedom from hunger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the second after the first summit held in 1974 which, 22 years later, is being described as a failed talk show whose resolutions have largely been unfulfilled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, organizers of the Rome summit emphasize it will not be a &quot;pledging conference, nor is it aimed at creating new financial mechanism, institutions or bureaucracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Each participating nation will consider independently how and what it might wish to contribute to the implementation of the policies, strategies and the plan of action that will be adopted by the summit,&quot; say the organizers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Broadly, governments will be implored to revisit the old societal commitment of ensuring food security as a top national, regional and global priority alongside peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are seven commitments that world leaders would be expected to put their signatures to, albeit with possible amendments. These are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- To ensure a political, social and economic environment, based on the equal participation of women and men, that is most conducive to food for all;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- To ensure that policies and institutions contribute to improving access by all to nutritionally adequate and safe food at all times;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- To endeavour to meet transitory and emergency food requirements in ways that encourage recovery, development and capacity to satisfy future food needs;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- To ensure that food, agriculture and rural development policies encourage adequate and reliable food supplies at the household, national and global level;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- To ensure that that food and agricultural trade policies are conducive to improved security;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- To promote appropriate investments in sustainable agricultural, forestry and fisheries production and post-production development, and in supporting research, infrastructure and services; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- To pledge cooperation in implementation and monitoring of the World Food Summit plan of action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambian President Frederick Chiluba has told South African President Nelson Mandela that he will break the political impasse facing his country on the elections scheduled for Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba made the proposals, details of which have not been made public, at his one-hour meeting with Mandela in Pretoria on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation late Tuesday said Chiluba is expected to announce his decisions soon after consultations with his cabinet.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela told a joint press briefing with Chiluba at the end of their talks that the Zambian president had made &quot;a very important proposal&quot; which could end the election boycott by several opposition parties, including the main opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP), led by former President Kenneth Kaunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am satisfied that we have made good progress which can bring about a solution...&quot; said Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba himself expressed similar confidence and told reporters: &quot;I believe we will resolve this problem one way or the other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He declined to confirm current widespread speculation that he was considering putting off the Nov. 18 polls until the contentious issues are resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNIP and six minor political parties are boycotting the elections in protest against a &quot;doctored&quot; voters roll and the constitutional amendments which bar Kaunda from challenging Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela, who is chairman of the 12-nation Southern African Developing Community, of which both South Africa and Zambia are members, had summoned Chiluba and Kaunda in an eleventh hour attempt to urge the two leaders to resolve their differences to save the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa felt duty-bound to assist prevent any chaos in Zambia which, he said, all South Africans considered as their &quot;second home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We sought asylum in Zambia during our thrust against apartheid in South Africa...and we consider Zambia as our second home,&quot; said Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda, as president of Zambia, sheltered the headquarters of then banned African National Congress at great expense and sacrifice for Zambians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba has in the past accused Mandela of having &quot;a soft spot&quot; for Kaunda, who is generally credited with the championing of liberation movements in Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia, under Kaunda, hosted the OAU Liberation Center and accommodated freedom fighters from Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BAMAKO, Mali (PANA) - Gold panning accounts for one-third of all gold production in Mali, in spite of the growing presence of major world mining companies in the country, official sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four tons of gold are produced industrially every year in Mali, as against 2.2 tons produced by individual gold diggers, according to a document released the ministry of mining in Bamako, the capital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministry is to celebrate a gold festival on Nov. 30, in commemoration of the role played by artisan gold production in the history of the Malian nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henceforth, the government hopes to fully integrate the sector into the government's national mining policy, the document said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prospection licenses have been issued to Malian citizens capable of entering into partnership agreements with private foreign investors, it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document said Corridors have also been set aside for gold panning to ensure better supervision. The decision is also aimed at pre-emptying conflict between gold panners and holders of official licenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gold panning is an age-old activity in hundreds of sites in Mali, and employs over 100,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials in Bamako said gold mining companies have pledged to invest some 227 billion CFA francs (about 454,000,000 dollars) in the industry in the coming years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mali's balance of trade has considerably improved in recent years, thanks to earnings from gold, which has become the country's second export product after cotton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mali plans to export about 127.4 billion CFA (about 254,200,000 dollars) worth of gold in 1997.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More (countries) are expected to follow suit, as consultations are still going on,&quot; Salim told a press conference. &quot;The critical point for us is not the contribution of contingents, but the availability of resources on sustainable basis to ensure an effective African participation in the multinational force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Eritrea pledged to contribute a brigade and Mali, a battalion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim welcomed Canada's decision to lead the multinational force, noting that Canada has had an unblemished record in U.N. peacekeeping tasks in Africa and elsewhere in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Africa's interest now is the urgent deployment of the proposed force to facilitate humanitarian aid to the refugees and displaced persons.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rome - WFP STOCKS IN THE REGION: WFP's current stock level in the region amounts to 71,358 mt. Of this amount, some 34,000 are currently allocated to the Eastern Zaire crisis, sufficient to feed 1.5 million beneficiaries (including 1.25 million refugees and 250,000 affected Zairian population) for approximately 50 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to be prepared for an immediate response, WFP has prepared 200mt of food commodities in Kampala, from its regional stock, for possible airdropping into Eastern Zaire (airdropping requires special packaging). An additional 107 mt of high-energy biscuits have been prepositioned in Kampala from WFP emergency stocks in Pisa, Italy. This emergency stock is in preparation for a possible airlift/airdrop.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KINSHASA: General strike 12 November in Kinshasa. All UN and international staff have been requested to stay in their residence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOMA: UN team, consisting of 3 WFP staff members, crossed the border into Goma from Gisenyi this morning. The UN team has been able to cross the border on 11, 12 and 13 November. Today, after negotiations with local authorities, WFP has been able to begin unloading its food commodities for distribution to the most needy at the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Offloading began, however was interrupted when mortar shells were launched from the area of Mugunga camp 3 miles from the hospital) into the hospital.  One WFP truck has been unloaded. The WFP trucks, which brought in 7 mt of maize meal and 2.1 mt of pulses, until late morning today, had been blocked by the local authorities at the stadium in Goma. Other relief agencies brought in non-food items and medicines with 4 trucks, and like WFP, the trucks had been blocked at the stadium before receiving authorisation to discharge today at the hospital. Food is of very limited supply in Goma.  Local shops are empty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Access to Mugunga camp (presently estimated at some 400,000 refugees in need of food and water) is presently not possible. Local negotiations on the ground have begun with the UN teams. These efforts join other UN negotiating efforts in the region. Food stocks have been prepositioned in Gisenyi and are ready to enter once conditions permit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUKAVU: Although WFP staff member was able to enter with the UN assessment team into Bukavu from Cyangugu on 11 November, access was denied on 12 November, and, as of 12:00 GMT on 13 November, access has also been denied. 2 WFP staff members, as well as WFP trucks carrying food commodities, are ready at the border to enter into Bukavu with the UN team should clearance be permitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports have indicated that the Bukavu airport is under the control of the new forces, but that there are obstacles on the airstrip. UVIRA: WFP/UNHCR are still trying to make contact with the authorities in Uvira in order to eventually gain clearance to cross into Zaire from Burundi. UN teams are ready to enter once conditions permit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BURUNDI: Insecurity has increased in Burundi. It has led to the displacement of 8,000-10,000 people near Mugamba/Toro area in Bururi province.  CRS/Caritas are planning to go to the area to undertake a distribution using WFP food. A further 8,000 - 10,000 are displaced due to insecurity near Matongo in Kayanza Province. WFP tried to distribute in this area last week but could not due to heavy fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TANZANIA: As of 12 November, 14,500 Zairian refugees had arrived in Kigoma having fled from the Uvira region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Fourteen US military personnel arrived in Entebbe at 2 pm local time today. A further 40 personnel arrived later in the afternoon, and are setting up antennae and logistical backup for the relief effort for eastern Zaire at Entebbe airport. The advance team is called the Humanitarian Force Support Assistance Wing, and is expected to stay in Entebbe to set up a logistical base. The team arrived with two maritime surveillance aircraft and a C-141 transporter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Pentagon official said yesterday that the deployment of the team &quot; enhances the military's ability to respond but does not represent a commitment by the US to deploy other forces&quot;. AFP reports that the team was expected to be accompanied by representatives from Britain, France and Canada.  It will include medical specialists, engineers, civil affairs and security experts. The United States has been criticised for stalling plans for an multinational force, and was publicly blamed for holding up &quot;other willing countries&quot; by European Commissioner for Humanitarian Affairs, Emma Bonino, on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said today in Rome that he believed the UN Security Council would give a mandate for an intervention force &quot;within days&quot;. BBC quoted him as saying that &quot;every moment was precious&quot; and the eastern Zaire crisis was an &quot;all-out emergency&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Decisions to be made about the mandate of the intervention force include questions about establishing law and order in the area of conflict and deciding on rules of engagement concerning armed groups. Apart from urgent facilitation of humanitarian assistance, the multinational force would be faced with the problem of how to seperate intimidators from bona fide refugees, and how to deal with those committing &quot;war crimes&quot; in the area of conflict. Other dilemmas relate to how the force would deal with the long- term political problem of the Interahamwe and the former Rwandan forces who are reportedly heavily armed and have been using eastern Zaire as a base since 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of refugees from the deserted Katale camp (north of Goma) are reported in the forests around Masisi, and hundreds are dying every day.  Their location is described as being 65 to 75 kilometres away from Goma. An NGO working in Katale camp before it dispersed (population: 202,000) has information from local staff travelling with the refugees. The refugees are reportedly surviving on food found in villages and fields, consisting mostly of tree roots and rotten sweet potatoes, and are suffering mainly from dehydration and bloody diarrhoea. Much of the dehydration is attributed to the onset of diarrhoea. Increasing cases of dysentery and cholera were also reported. Another group from the dispersed Katale and Kahindo camps were caught up in fighting around Tongo (north west of Katale). About 200 people are reported killed from the fighting in the last twenty four hours, and most of the refugees have scattered and are travelling in small groups. Katale camp was mortared on October 28th, and international staff evacuated on November 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid representatives in Goma said today that shelling in the hospital compound forced aid workers to retreat as the first relief truck was unloading. A WFP representative told IRIN that today's events demonstrated how difficult it had been to get a token amount of aid into eastern Zaire: &quot; it's taken three days to move ten tons. It is very slow and insecure&quot;. A BBC correspondent described Goma town as tense, with mortar guns firing from Mugunga area west of the town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN Special Envoy Raymond Chretien and Humanitarian Coordinator Sergio Vieira de Mello are in Kinshasa today, continuing talks with the Zairean government on access routes to eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said on Tuesday that Canadian and US military officers and senior government officials have been discussing the details of the formation of a multinational taskforce in Washington. AFP reports that Lieutenant General Maurice Baril is taking part in the discussions and is expected to lead the multinational force. Prime Minister Chretien said a multinational force of between 6,000 and 10,000 is needed for eastern Zaire. France, who led the calls for international intervention, proposed 5,000 - but faced objections from the Rwandan government and Zairean rebels who accused France of lacking neutrality. Chretien said Canada could have a team of 350 military personnel on the ground in eastern Zaire &quot;within 48 hours&quot; of the Security Council agreeing on a mandate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Security Council faced international and regional criticism when it failed to decisively authorise a multinational intervention force on Sunday November 10. Momentum for intervention appeared to wane, until Canada offered to lead the force yesterday. United Nations Special Envoy to the Great Lakes Raymond Chretien said yesterday that he thought the force would arrive within the next seven days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rwandan government has objected to use of French troops, but reports say it is willing to accept France taking part in a multinational force on a logistical level. AFP quotes diplomatic sources in Kinshasa today as saying Rwanda has given consent to Canada leading the force. Rwandan vice president and defence minister Paul Kagame said on state-run radio yesterday that the neutrality of the force was crucial. He said the eastern Zaire crisis was an internal problem for Zaire, and that the force should not interfere with it.  He said a multinational force should instead concentrate on the humanitarian aspect of of getting assistance to the refugees and facilitating repatriation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leader of the European Union delegation Joan Burton said on state-run Rwandan radio yesterday that the government had expressed concern about the future of the Banyamulenge people and others in Zaire of Tutsi ethnic origin.  She also said the EU delegation had discussed with the Zaire government in Kinshasa the transition to democracy, and especially questions of citizenship.  This would relate to the issue of the nationality of the Banyamulenge (ethnic Tutsis) in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Persistent sources indicate some 100,000 displaced people congregating in Fizi, including internally displaced people and refugees. One aid representive told IRIN that many who had fled to coastal villages report they were attacked by fleeing Zairean soldiers. There are also reports from those who fled Uvira that Zairean soldiers targetted ethnic Tutsis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN World Health Organisation said today that it could not confirm cases of cholera reported in eastern Zaire. Spokesman Philippe Stroot said that although all the elements seem present for an outbreak, due to bad sanitation, there were no confirmed cases of cholera. WHO is planning to send a specialist from Geneva to the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kinshasa was reported as uneasy as residents stayed at home yesterday - students had given Tuesday as an ultimatum for Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo to step down. AFP say the streets of Kinshasa were deserted yesterday, after a week of demonstrations and student unrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven African countries have offered to contribute troops or support to a military intervention force for Zaire. Botswanan foreign affairs acting permanent secretary Charles Ntwaagae said today his country could send between 600 and 800 troops to the region, joining Ethiopia, Senegal, Congo, Chad, Mali and South Africa. Western involvement in the form of military support or humanitarian aid so far has been pledged by Canada, USA, the EU, Italy, France, Britain, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium and the Nordic countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Shots were fired at a small plane flying over Goma this morning, reports AFP and BBC. AFP say anti-aircraft guns fired at the plane as apparent warning shots, and say the rebels have also threatened to shoot at French troops if they come into territory held by the rebel Alliance of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebel commander Andre Kissasse-Ngandu issued the threats at a press conference today in Goma, when he said a small unidentified plane had been seen flying over the Sake region, about 25 kilometres west of Goma on Tuesday.  Planes known to have been flying in eastern Zaire since rebels took about 300 kilometres of border territory, include those conducting aerial surveys for aid agencies and military planes attempting to evacuate retreating Zairean soldiers. A flight chartered by Associated Press filmed refugees congregated at Mugunga and deserted sites at Kibumba, Kahindo and Katale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations Special Envoy for the Great Lakes region, Raymond Chretien, is exploring access routes to eastern Zaire from within Zaire. The Zairean government is emphatic that aid passing through rebel territory would be unacceptable and would constitute a violation of territorial integrity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid through Zaire would have to come through western Zaire, and poses major logistical problems. A WFP representative told IRIN that an estimated 500 tons of food a day would have to moved out of Kisangani, eastern Zaire, to areas in Kivu, some 500 kilometres away. This would require a fleet of C130s doing 32 rotations a day into Kisangani, with a huge trucking fleet. There would also be an immediate need for storage, logistical backup and fuel - all of which is not available in eastern Zaire. A UN assessment mission this year in Zaire came to the conclusion that large scale relief operations from inside Zaire were not feasible. The Zairean government denied permission to a proposed UN assessment mission to Kisangani this week. Kisangani currently has a growing number of fleeing Zairean soldiers, which has raised tension in the town and caused insecurity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ICRC plans to send a flight from Kinshasa to Kisangani today with limited relief goods and staff to strengthen their delegation there. Further flights are planned if permission can be secured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the context of an aid distribution in Goma, the inter-agency assessment mission met on Monday, 11 November, with one of the local leaders in order to set down the principles which would govern possible UN assistance missions.  It was agreed that the presence of UN agencies and contacts with the authorities do not represent a recognition of any sort or an infringement of Zairean sovereignty, and that UN missions and staff would be regarded as neutral. An independent assessment of the needs and the prevailing security conditions in the area is to be carried out as a priority. Practical issues such as the return of UN and NGO property, the reduction of border formalities and verification of aid brought into Goma were raised and will be resolved in collaboration with local authorities, who agreed to name a single liaison officer to facilitate procedures. Local authorities requested that staff hired by aid agencies and NGOs - aside from expatriate personnel, whose nationality or past assignments will not be taken into account - be natives or residents of the Goma area and that the agencies and NGOs not visit military installations; the UN mission acceded to these requests. An NGO representative was present during most of the discussions and it was understood that these conditions apply also to the NGO community. A meeting between rebel spokesman Kabila and NGOs wishing to operate in Goma was planned for this morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR says it finds itself &quot;in the midst of a quandary of humanitarian, political and security challenges&quot;. In a statement to the Organisation of African Unity, David Lambo, UNHCR Regional Liaison Representative for Africa said on Monday that the &quot;complex and unfolding drama is unprecedented in the history of UNHCR&quot;. He said reports confirm that many thousands have died, or face death, after fleeing camps and going deep into the hills and forests of Zaire. A small number of Rwandan refugees have fled to neighbouring Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the OAU meeting was crucial to push forward plans to allow effective delivery of aid, and there was need for a sustainable cease-fire.  The UNHCR representative listed immediate delivery of humanitarian assistance, orderly repatriation of refugees, the establishment of return corridors, and separation of intimidators from bona fide refugees as the top priorities. He also said that UNHCR and other agencies would monitor reintegration of returning Rwandan refugees. He warned that failure to find a solution to the present crisis may lead to even greater political instability and humanitarian problems, and that no-one should underestimate the enormity of the humanitarian crisis - &quot;the picture of over a million refugees going deeper into Zaire, wandering aimlessly around, dying of starvation, disease and exhaustion, is a very frightening prospect indeed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundian refugees have also been affected by the eastern Zaire crisis, many having fled the Uvira area. Reports of increased violence and conflict in Burundi continue, believed to be related to the eastern Zaire crisis (see previous IRIN updates). State-run Burundi radio reported yesterday that security forces had engaged in a three hour fight with an armed group on the Bujumbura-Jenda road. It said armed groups had also been reported in Muhuta, Mugamba and Burambi in Bururi Province. Security forces say they captured Kalashnikovs and a rocket launcher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundian refugees in Kigoma have been advised not to engage in any political activities, and to live peacefully, reported state-run Tanzania radio yesterday. An aid representative who had visited refugees in Kigoma told IRIN today that the number of new arrivals had dropped to about 400 a day. From November 9th, the number of refugees at Kigoma is said to be 14,400.  They are predominantly Zaireans. Refugees - who include local aid workers - told the aid representative that an estimated 50,000 refugees remained in the Uvira area. Refugees who first arrived by small fishing boats were said to be carrying televisions, computers and household goods - referred to as &quot;middle class refugees&quot; by one NGO. The refugees are in relatively good condition. A fee of about $100 was charged to this first catagory of refugees, with three or four boat-loads of about 400 refugees a day. The price has apparently dropped, as has the number of refugees arriving; aid workers say they are not clear whether this is because there are fewer people fleeing the area, or whether it is because those left behind are less able to get to Kigoma. Aid agencies also report that many of the refugees have landed on the beaches and are staying in inaccessible fishing villages. Tension is apparently high between locals and the dependent refugees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - It is estimated that by the year 2000, Zimbabwe will have about 600,000 HIV/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) orphans as the deadly disease continues to take its toll. This is in addition to those who have lost parents as a result of other circumstances. Already, the rapidly rising numbers of children in orphanages has severely strained resources and ability to care for the unprecedented numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the early institutions like schools, hospitals and orphanages in this Southern African country were started by missionaries upon their arrival in the 18th Century. For example, Morgenster Press, Zimbabwe's first privately-owned printing press (although commissioned by the government) was established by the then Dutch Reformed Church - African Reformed Church, at Morgenster Mission in Masvingo Province in the 1890s.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the educational material in the major local language, Shona were printed at Morgenster until Mambo Press (Catholic), Longmans, College Press and other printing houses came in and took over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mathew Rusike Children's Home, situated about 10 kilometres east of the capital Harare, is another of the early institutions. Begun in 1950, the home is the brainchild of the late Rev. Mathew Rusike of the Trinity Methodist Church and his wife Rudo, from Kadoma (Midlands).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its beginnings are thus; One day Rev. Rusike came across two crying children, a girl and a boy aged about four and three years respectively. They were scantily dressed and obviously hungry and seemed to have been abandoned.  He took the children home, eventually integrating them into his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon afterwards, the Rusikes received more and more children in similar predicaments. However, Rev. Rusike's meagre income eventually failed to cope with the demands of the &quot;extended&quot; family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was at this stage that the Methodist Church came to the couple's rescue.  The children were moved to a large Methodist church farm next to the Epworth Theological College, thereby establishing the Mathew Rusike Children's Home.  Although it started with only a few children, the home now caters for about 140 whose ages range from two to 16 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a lot of mobility at the home with those completing primary school at the institution's schools being sent elsewhere for secondary education.  However, this home does not accept children below the age of two years. These are referred to other centres such as the government-run Chinyaradzo Children's home in Highfield, Harare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mathew Rusike is at present unable to accept all the children needing a place there because of lack of space. At the time of filing this article, the home was undergoing extensions to enable it accommodate more children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Church of Christ missionaries have also embarked on an ambitious project to establish a community of up to 1,000 orphaned and abandoned children, being integrated into families with both parents who have up to four children of their own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project called Khayelihle Children's Village (KVC), was started by Paul and Karen Reyman, along the same lines as the Mathew Rusike one in 1992. The two were moved by the plight of AIDS and other orphans and abandoned children in Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In particular, we were shocked by the projections that by the year 2000, there would be more than 60,000 AIDS orphans,&quot; says Paul Reyman. &quot;We felt we should do our part to alleviate the problem,&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khayelihle, local Ndebele language for Good Home will most probably be the only home of its kind in Zimbabwe. Its history actually began with 11-year- old Precious Moyo. Her mother died of an undisclosed illness last March in Mutare, eastern Zimbabwe, prompting the young girl to move in with her grandmother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Precious was so abused by her grandmother in Bulawayo, that some elders of the Church of Christ had to take her away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twelve-year-old Carlos Mpofu moved out of his Mzilikhazi family home, also in Bulawayo, to live out in the streets because his single and unemployed mother could no longer afford to provide for her four children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Precious and Carlos are now &quot;brother and sister&quot; leading normal lives as part of a foster family of eight children in a modest house in Matsheumhlope, one of Bulawayo's affluent suburbs. The Church of Christ aims at seeing these family models of Khayelihle grow and grow, and according to the Reymans, &quot;the sky is the limit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1992, Paul and Karen approached church elders and other prominent people in their society to participate in the establishment of a children's home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 1994, Khayelihle Children Village was registered as a welfare organization chaired by Matabeleland Water Trust co-ordinator Kingsley Dube.  The trust, a non-governmental organization, seeks to pump water from the Zambezi River to drought-prone Bulawayo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Clover Nook Charity Foundation, United States, pledged US$100 million (Z$ 1 billion) while the Church of Christ in Australia and New Zealand have also pledged yet undisclosed financial assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had difficulties getting land around Bulawayo but in the end we landed a $50,000 (US$5,000), 50-year-lease on a 2,090 hectare plot on Olive Tree Farm,&quot; says Reyman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incidentally, Olive Farm, 50 kilometres south of Bulawayo, is where a group of missionaries were murdered in Zimbabwe's brief post- independence war in 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Construction of K.V.C. has already begun and in 10 years' time according to its board of directors, the centre will have built modern houses for up to 10 children each, including pre-schools, a skills training centre, clinics and shops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The community is expected to be self-sufficient as there is abundant water for crop production, cattle ranching and other agricultural activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additional cottage industries would also be set up to ensure adequate jobs for the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to create a complete community for abandoned children. The idea is to keep the children here when they grow up and start their own families.  There should be enough resources to expand the community,&quot; says Reyman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first group of about 150 children, including the family in Matsheumhlope, are expected to move to the farm at the beginning of 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope that by then we will have built houses at least. It would be too early to build schools but we intend to integrate the children into the local community so they will go to local schools and clinics,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KVC board chairman Kingsley Dube hopes the Department of Social Welfare would help in identifying the needy children. However, any children, particularly AIDS orphans, are eligible to benefit from the project and are encouraged to contact KVC officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matabeleland North provincial governor Welshman Mabhena, commenting on this exciting new development in his constituency says; &quot;I truly think this will be one of the most significant contributions to the social and economic development of Zimbabwe.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Zairean leader Mobutu Sese Seko, 66, has suddenly left the Swiss holiday report of Lausanne, where he has been staying since last August while receiving treatment for prostate cancer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His departure on November 4 came one day after a Swiss parliamentarian questioned his luxurious lifestyle at the Lausanne resort where he lived in a $2,000 per day suite, at a time when Zaire is in chaos following the rapid advances of ethnic Zairean Tutsi Banyamulenge rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebels with the support of the Rwandese Patriotic Front (RPF) have seized most of Eastern Zaire. Rwanda has denied the involvement of the RPF on Zairean territory.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu has now moved to his luxury villa in Nice, southern France where he will be staying for the next few days before returning to Zaire. However, observers say the Zairean President is unlikely to return to the capital Kinshasa, but will go to his palace in Gbadolite in Equator Province, from where he will manipulate events at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu is recovering from cancer and may not be in a position to make a dramatic difference to the situation at home. In Kinshasa, thousands of students have taken to the streets to demand the removal of the reformist Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo, who is part- Tutsi, charging that he has done little to stall the swift advances of Tutsi rebels in the East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The brutal Zairean Army Chief of Staff, General Eluki Mongi, went out of his way to blame Kengo for the mess in the East. However, many liberal minded Zaireans are impressed by General Eluki's charges against the premier since his troops have performed very poorly indeed in confronting the uprising in the troubled area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports from North and South Kivu Provinces in the East which are largely under rebel control, told of Zairean troops more inclined to loot and run away at the slightest encounter with the Banyamulenge rebels. General Eluki who, like Mobutu comes from Equator region, has been careful not to blame his president for the mess despite the fact that the Army had no money while Mobutu paid holiday resort $1,400,00 in advance for himself and his entourage for their three month stay in Switzerland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eluki praised the Transition Parliament of Zaire which is currently under the control of Mobutu supporters for the &quot;patriotic support of Zairean sovereignty&quot; in the face of Rwandese backed rebellion in the East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as emotions run high against the Tutsi uprising in the East, angry Zaireans turned their wrath on Zaireans of Tutsi origin. Many are now in hiding or have fled across the river Congo into neighbouring Congo-Brazaville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fleeing Tutsis are paying as much as $3,000 for the privilege of being taken across the river by canoe away from harm in Kinshasa where the Transition Parliament has already voted to sack all Tutsis from the Armed Forces and the Zairean civil service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighbouring Congo announced on November 5, it will allow Tutsis with Rwandese passports to enter Congo on transit to Rwanda, but will not allow Zairean Tutsis into its territory &quot;because Congo lacks facilities for the maintenance of refugees,&quot; said a government statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Except for students and youthwingers who are roving in Kinshasa advocating tough action in the East, most Zaireans are less concerned because life is very difficult for them generally and there is no time for political distractions. There are however unconfirmed reports that Tutsis are being targeted in the central Zairean town of Lubumbashi. Their properties are being broken into and looted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Etienne Tshisekedi, the hardline anti-Mobutu Member of Parliament who lost his job as Prime Minister in the early 90s after he called Mobutu &quot;a monster&quot;, surprised many observers when he asked the Zairean public to contribute to the war kitty. Cynical observers believe Tshisekedi made political capital out of military reverses in the East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goma, the last important town to fall into the hands of rebels, was the centre of international relief activities until a combined force of Rwandese Army and Tutsi rebels seized it early November. The local Red Cross in Goma say they buried 400 corpses, casualties of the fighting and looting. There are reports that a number of Zairean troops have defected and are fighting alongside the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sprawling camps in Goma that housed 500,000 Hutu refugees who fled Rwanda after the 1994 genocide are now empty. The refugees have been pushed deeper into the Zairean hinterland and are reported to have no food or water except what they can forage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But France is feverishly trying to have the refugee camps in Eastern Zaire reconstituted. She has put forward a plan in the United Nations Security Council, urging that UN peacekeepers - meaning mainly the French - should move in &quot;and restore order.&quot; The plan envisages the formation of &quot;havens of safety&quot; for the refugees whom aid agencies say will die in tens of thousands if nothing is done to save them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A similar plan has been adopted by seven Great Lakes regional states meeting in Nairobi, Kenya, under the chairmanship of Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi. The heads of state of Zambia, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Rwanda, Kenya and Uganda called for the deployment of a neutral peacekeeping force and an immediate ceasefire. They called for temporary sanctuaries within Zaire to facilitate humanitarian assistance which would be delivered via &quot; safe corridors.&quot; A notable absentee at the summit was Zairean Premier Kengo Wa Dondo who had earlier indicated he would attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Rwanda, while endorsing the peace formulas of the regional heads of state, remains entirely opposed to the entry of the French into Zaire under any guise. The Rwandese say France is not a neutral party to the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda's Foreign Minister Anastasio Gasana, repeated the old charge that France's &quot;Operation Turquoise&quot; in south-western Rwanda mid- 1994, actually helped countless Hutu perpetrators of genocide to escape and subsequently use the camps in Eastern Zaire as a launching pad against the Tutsi-led regimes of Rwanda and Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the United Nations, Germany has also opposed France's idea of re- establishing refugee camps in Eastern Zaire under a new name, Sanctuary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers believe that Germany's doubts are the result of a leaked report compiled by senior United Nations staffers, illustrating in detail that a number of regional countries and France, far from working for peace, have actually been arming extremist Hutu forces with the aim of overthrowing the Tutsi led regimes in Rwanda and Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The internal report told of relief food given by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) being sold by recipients in the camps and a &quot;war tax&quot; being levied on these sales. The &quot;war tax&quot; was then used to buy weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report further showed that far from being the aggressed party, Zaire may have been the real aggressor since Kinshasa as well as the refugee camps were the hub of massive clandestine activities against Rwanda and Burundi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - The &quot;Beatification of the Area Boy&quot; is a critical play which satirizes present day Nigeria and its military regime. The life of the common man is one of frustrations and the struggle for one's basic needs is a nightmare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest of Wole Soyinka's theatre pieces currently doing the rounds in Europe and America, the play aims at sensitizing the international community to take stern action against this West African country and coerce the military regime to respect the citizenry.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exiled since 1994, Wole Soyinka the Nobel Prize laureate for literature has never stopped criticising the incumbent regime in Nigeria. He has time and again, called upon the international community to impose sanctions on Sani Abacha's military regime so that Nigeria can encounter genuine democracy which has been elusive since the Babangida era.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">his time, Wole Soyinka, a master playwright in collaboration with Jude Kelly have directed The Beatification of the Area Boy. With a cast of about 20 artists from Nigeria, Britain and Switzerland, the play is a beautifully crafted piece of theatre that takes what it needs from Western dramatic conventions and then does what it wants to do to commemorate and commiserate with the daily life of Nigerians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the surface, it is a straight slice of life, eavesdropped and reported one day in the vibrant and violent, and cruel and colourful life of a street corner in post-oil boom Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The criticism of the regime is carried out with a light touch. There is humour. However, the underlying message is serious. A critical look at the cast interprets these issues well. The judge who is demented sees a new dawn, void of the oppressive military regime. Mama Put, a petty businesswoman in the street adjacent to La Plaza shopping centre ekes out a miserly living but she has bitter memories of the Biafran war where she lost her brother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The whole play revolves around Sanda. The organizer of the area boys. He is the oga (the chief), the security officer of La Plaza shopping centre, a learned man with university education. Rather than become unemployed, he opts for the job of a security officer and organizes the area boys to eke out their living too by posing as guards for vehicles of bigshots who come to shop at La Plaza. Occasionally, they pilfer some valuable items from these vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a more subtle manner, Sanda is the kin pin of all the activities which take place around La Plaza. A raging crowd would wish to lynch a man who made someone's genitals &quot;disappear&quot; using magic (juju). They believe that this mutilation is 'contagious'. But somehow, Sanda intervenes to calm the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a marriage ceremony conducted at La Plaza instead of Misenyi, (a former girlfriend during their university heydays being married to the army chief), the bride to be offers the traditional calabash to Sanda during the occasion.  This is an instance of dramatic irony. It creates commotion and confusion during the ceremony, prompting the army top brass to leave, obviously feeling humiliated but ready to charge back and revenge. Sanda reorganizes the area boys and devises a strategy to ward off the impending disaster to be carried out by the military officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The play has a grim setting on the poor Maroko quarters. Maroko, home to about one million inhabitants was razed down by the military to put up a shopping centre, La Plaza. Genuine documentary evidence prove that in the mid- 80's, Maroko was indeed a residential area for over one million people but it was razed down by the military during the Babangida regime. The residential area was reduced to ashes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economic situation is ridiculed when &quot;Big Man&quot; shopper comes on stage on a bicycle to purchase a neck-tie from &quot;Trader&quot;. Everybody marvels and wonders why 'an iron horse' in the present day oil rich Nigeria where once upon a time, all the average income earners owned motor cycles. What is wrong with Nigeria? Where has all the oil they mine gone to? A bicycle song infused at this juncture in the play displays the satire in quite a humorous manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The grim situation of economic mismanagement and political anarchy where the common man is frustrated and social degradation is rampant, is not only a problem in Nigeria but in most African countries, remarked Camara, among the audience during the performance at Forum Meyrin Theatre in Switzerland on September 17,1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why did Soyinka pick on beatification in a connotation sense and why an area boy for the honour?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian playwright gave the following explanation; Beatification in the Catholic and Islamic context is when people organize a religious ceremony to bestow honour on a person who lived an exemplary dignified life. &quot;I adopted this for my play. The area boy who is beatified organizes those around him well. He creates with his gang some order within the already chaotic situation. A moral way of living within the common citizenry.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soyinka continues to elaborate that he had to emphasize that for these people in the low strata, everything is dislocated and nothing functions efficiently. The striking of crude oil has brought nothing of gain to the people. &quot;My play is a ritual and at the same time a macabre Nigerian dance,&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Beatification of the Area Boy was jointly produced by West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds (England) and Nawao Produktion Zurich (Switzerland).  Produced mid-this year, the play was first performed at Theatre Spektakel in Zurich from September 3 to 6. It did its rounds in Geneva, Bern, and Basel last September. It was performed in Berlin, Germany from October 2 to 5 and was scheduled for other shows at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York in the United States from October 9 to 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, no show had been scheduled for Africa. This is ironical. The piece displays the African problem but the genuine Africans who encounter these problems do not have the opportunity to witness this grim situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The play which fuses the modern Western forms of art and music with African art forms is a critique not only for Nigeria but also for Africa. Wole Soyinka has used the pen and his deft fingers to communicate a subtle message.  The international community, especially in Europe and America should take up the cudgels to fight against the deterioration of human rights in Nigeria and indeed Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The late Ken Saro Wiwa sensitized the Ogoni community to fight for their agricultural land, already rendered useless by oil exploration. Worse still, they were denied their share of the crude oil which was extracted and exported from Ogoniland while successive military regimes relished the giant portion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wole Soyinka, in a style different from that of executed leader of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), is subtly out to sensitize the international community on the genuine reality in Nigeria. The poverty and oppression of the majority and the opulence of those at the helm who rule by the barrel of the gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Beatification of the Area Boy is a serious play which can be assessed from various angles and facets. It interprets a genuine Nigerian situation which is also true and relevant to other nations in Black Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI (APS) - African nations have been challenged to turn to God for effective solutions to the difficulties facing the continent today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In many instances, we have mistakenly imagined that the solutions to the many social, economic and political problems facing us today lie within our military strength rather than on God. And results have been terribly bad,&quot; lamented the co-ordinator of Kenya Prophetic Destiny, a group of Christians concerned about the problems facing this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should stop thinking that guns, among other military strength, would yield the urgently needed solutions to the problems facing our continent today,&quot; Rev. Omondi stressed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged African countries that are not facing calamities similar to those experienced elsewhere to turn to God as they have surely learnt some lessons from the civil strife, harsh economic conditions and political instability among other problems prevailing on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have so much to learn from countries such as Rwanda, Burundi and Zaire, to mention but a few. We must not lose sight of these while we continue to pray to God to intervene in the people's sufferings,&quot; Rev. Omondi added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the breakfast prayer gathering which was attended by a group of church leaders and ministers, journalists and politicians that the Kenya Prophetic Destiny would organise a national day of repentance and reconciliation on November 9 in the Kenyan capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have been concerned about the recurrent conflicts affecting the African continent in general and Eastern Africa in particular,&quot; said pastor Omondi, in a press statement, issued at the breakfast meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent prophecies and pronouncements in the local and international media, and an apparent mood of anxiety and uncertainty confirm that all may not be well in Kenya, the Kenyan pastor noted in the press release which he jointly signed with Bishop William K. Tumising of the Deliverance Church, Rev. Daniel M. Seruwanga (PACLA II), the Most Rev. Manasses Kuria (Jehovah Jireh Christian Homes for Street Children and Families) and Rev. Ambrose A. Nyangao (Parklands Baptist Church).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement described members of the Kenya Prophetic Destiny as &quot; Christians, called by God, to see, hear, touch and feel the pain and anguish of our nation. We are called to identify with an acknowledge the sins and the wicked ways of this nation, to be humbled and broken by the weight of our iniquity, and turn back to God in prayer, repentance, remorsefulness and reconciliation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group functions under the auspices of the Pan African Christian Leadership Assembly (PACLA II) follow-up committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement concluded by quoting from 2 Chronicles 7:14; &quot;If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and will heal their land.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the same gathering, retired Church of the Province of Kenya (CPK) Archbishop Manasses Kuria, said; &quot;We cannot claim not to be party to the African nations that need to be healed. We have shed blood amongst our brothers and sisters during the height of the land clashes (1991/93). We definitely need to call God to intervene.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition legislator Njenga Mungai, whose Molo constituency in the Rift Valley Province was seriously affected by the politically motivated ethnic land clashes, welcomed the churches' idea of setting aside a day for national prayers for this East African nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a wonderful idea and we look forward to participate. I hope all of us -- church leaders, Christians, the ruling party KANU (Kenya African National Union) and the Opposition, will find time and joy to attend the occasion,&quot; said Mr. Mungai.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI/GENEVA (APS) - The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has instructed all its field staff in Sudan to discontinue their humanitarian activities until all personnel seized when the agency's aircraft was impounded in Southern Sudan have been released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A press release issued by ICRC headquarters in Geneva on November 6, said two pilots, a nurse and five patients returning home from an ICRC treatment facility in northern Kenya were still in the hands of a breakaway faction of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) rebels by late last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pilots are Canadian and Kenyan, the nurse is Australian while the five patients are Southern Sudanese.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seizure of the plane, ICRC personnel and five patients occurred at Wuorok in Southern Sudan, 800 kilometres from the capital Khartoum, on November 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been confirmed that fighters loyal to Commander Kerubino Kwanyin Bol, a rival of Colonel John Garang of the mainstream SPLA were responsible for the seizure. Commander Kerubino is now allied with the Khartoum authorities, having signed the &quot;Peace Charter&quot; in Khartoum last July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the seizure, Sudan accused ICRC of helping Col. John Garang's SPLA, charging that the ICRC had &quot;violated humanitarian principles and its own mandate.&quot; The government charged that the five patients were rebels being helped to return to the theatre of operations in the South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ali Sadiq, spokesman for the Sudanese Embassy in Nairobi, told APS that the government had &quot;incontrovertible evidence&quot; that the plane had ferried the fighters with their guns and 20 boxes of ammunition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are very disappointed to see the people we trusted so much involved in a conspiracy against the people of Sudan,&quot; said Mr. Sadiq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But an ICRC Sudan delegate in Nairobi Nick Sommere, denied that the agency's plane was carrying guns and ammunition. &quot;We know what we put on the planes. There were no guns and no ammunition,&quot; he told APS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was surprised by the charges emanating from Khartoum &quot;since they know very well that the job of the ICRC is to care for the wounded in conflict situations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sommere reiterated that the ICRC is neutral in the conflict and had two hospitals catering for the war wounded in Juba, Southern Sudan and Lokichoggio in Turkana, north-western Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We make no distinction. A wounded person whether from the government side or one who belongs to the rebel factions is given medical treatment without prejudice,&quot; he told APS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr. Sadiq, his government authorities had confirmed that following the incident at Wuorok, all work by the ICRC in Sudan had been banned &quot;till further notice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement from ICRC headquarters described the charges by the Khartoum authorities as unfortunate &quot;and entirely without foundation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAPE TOWN (APS) - South Africa's controversial abortion- on-demand bill passed its final hurdle to becoming law on November 5, when it was adopted by a majority of the 90-member Senate, passing it with a 49 to 21 vote, despite continuing protests by the country's Roman Catholic church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The controversial Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Bill, which is regarded as one of the most liberal abortion laws in the world, is expected to be signed into law soon by President Nelson Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill was piloted through the Senate, parliament's upper house, by Mandela's ruling African National Congress (ANC) and opposed by the National Party (NP), the Zulu-nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and several smaller opposition parties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it did when the bill was passed on October 30, when a total of 209 members voted for, 87 against and five abstained, the ANC which holds 252 seats, did not allow a free vote on the bill, while the NP and IFP allowed their members to vote according to conscience or belief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill, which allows women and girls to have abortions performed in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, and in the first 20 weeks in certain circumstances, has also been widely opposed by religious groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of Roman Catholics, armed with messages of support from Pope John Paul II and Nobel Prize laureate Mother Teresa, held marches in South Africa's major centres on November 2 to protest the bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition political groups, including the NP, the small liberal Democratic Party (DP) and the radical black Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC) allowed their members to vote freely on the measure, while the ANC insisted that its members vote in favour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, a number of ANC members of the Roman Catholic Church, which steadfastly opposes abortions, decided not to attend the October 30 vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every year, more than 250,000 women, mainly black, have illegal &quot;backstreet&quot; abortions performed, and of these, at least 425 die in South African hospitals as a result of infections and bleeding, according to official figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until now, only about 1,000 women have been raped are victims of incest, or whose pregnancy poses a danger to their lives, have qualified each year for legal abortions in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NP attacked the new document, however, for allowing teenage girls to have abortions performed without first consulting their parents or guardians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passing of the bill, originally set to occur on October 29, was delayed at the last minute by the NP, which offered half a dozen amendments to be considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amendments were voted out later on October 29 at a hastily summoned meeting of the parliament's health committee, prompting a walk-out by two NP committee members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NP spokesman Sheila Camerer warned her party could decide to challenge the bill in South Africa's Constitutional Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DP supported the bill on the grounds that hundreds of thousands of South Africans are unable financially, or physically, to care for unwanted children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Religious groupings, including the Roman Catholic Church, Dutch Reformed Church and various Islamic groupings had staged vocal anti- abortion protests the previous week in a last-ditch effort to prevent the bill's passing, but without success.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KINSHASA (APS) - Some 10,000 Zairean stormed into the streets of the capital Kinshasa on November 5, demanding the resignation of Zairean Prime Minister Kengo Wa Ndondo over the crisis in eastern Zaire, where government forces are battling Tutsi rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstrators, most of them students, riding in hundreds of commandeered vehicles streamed down Kinshasa's main avenue, chanting slogans calling for the resignation of the Prime Minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They accuse him of bungling the crisis after the Zairean authorities admitted on November 4 that they had lost control of eastern Zaire's two key towns of Bukavu and Goma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We support the armed forces&quot; battling Tutsi rebels in eastern Zaire, the demonstrators shouted as the jammed trucks rumbled down June 30 Boulevard, trailing a banner reading &quot;Thank you France&quot; outside the French embassy, and &quot; We are going to see to you Belgians&quot; outside the Belgian embassy in the capital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belgium is Zaire's former colonial power, while France is widely accused of having bungled its &quot;Operation Turquoise&quot; during the Rwandan civil war in 1994, when Paris sent troops into Rwanda to create safe zones for displaced people, but were opposed by the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which won the war, because of France's role in supporting previous Hutu regimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The students had demonstrated in smaller numbers on November 1, calling for the ouster of Kengo and railing against Rwandan and Burundian national in Zaire, as well as ethnic Banyamulenge Tutsis who have lived in Zaire for nearly 200 years. Kengo is believed to have been born of a Tutsi mother and Zairean father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the first protest, students looted the residence of the Burundian ambassador and roughed up some Rwandan Tutsis, but the November 5 demonstration was better disciplined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although no incidents were reported between the students and security forces, the unprecedented demonstration was seen as a major blow for Kengo, though he had refused to attend a regional summit on Zaire which began in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, on November 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kengo had shown support for the Zairean army and said he would not attend the conference until &quot;the aggressors&quot; had left the east of the country -- a reference to Rwandan soldiers alleged to be helping the Tutsi rebels. Kigali has admitted to raiding Zairean territory the previous week, but says it had no troops there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political analysts said that if Kengo had gone to Nairobi, he would have sparked a violent reaction among a Zairean population fired by nationalist sentiment. Apart from Rwanda, Zaire has also accused Burundi and Uganda of being behind the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The previous week, the Zairean government was strongly criticised by the opposition for showing &quot;weakness&quot;, while the armed forces chief- of-staff General Eluki Mongi Aundu complained that the army had not been &quot;given the means to make war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a million refugees from Burundi and Rwanda and displaced Zaireans are caught up in the crisis and the United Nations aid agencies warned on November 5 of an impending humanitarian catastrophe in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstrations came as pressure was growing on Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko to return home from Europe, where the 67-year-old is convalescing from prostate cancer surgery, and prepares to meet in the French city of Nice with UN special envoy to the African Great Lakes region Raymond Chretiene of Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu, whose country faces a humanitarian disaster following fighting between his government troops and the Tutsi rebels, flew to France on November 4 from Switzerland where he had been treated for prostate cancer since August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diplomats familiar with the region say that if Mobutu returns to Zaire in the next few days, he would immediately take over political control of the refugee crisis from Kengo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, he is the only man who could overturn the decision to boycott any negotiations with Rwanda so long as a part of eastern Zaire is occupied by Rwandan nationals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the state of Mobutu's health was still unclear, with the French daily Le Monde, quoting sources close to Mobutu's doctors, as saying that his prostate cancer had spread to his bones and that his condition was too delicate for him to return home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kinshasa, however, presidential spokesman Kabya Lumuna said that Mobutu would return to his country in the &quot;coming days,&quot; raising hopes that he may be able to intervene actively to ease the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His absence from the political scene is all the more frustrating for France which has backed Zaire's incumbent despite international criticism of the country's human rights record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu, who seized power in 1965, allowed France to use Zairean territory for Operation Turquoise, the humanitarian mission mounted by France during the genocide in neighbouring Rwanda, leaving nearly one million people dead in 1994.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA (APS) - Uganda's Ministry of Health in conjunction with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the main sugar producing factories have set up a national Task Force to plan and implement the fortification of sugar with vitamin A.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move will benefit babies and nursing mothers in particular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Task Force is composed of the Head of Nutrition, Ministry of Health Mrs.  Ursula Wangwe who is the chairlady, representatives from three sugar producing factories, the Uganda National Bureau of Standards and UNICEF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fortification of foodstuffs such as sugar with vital minerals and vitamin was one of the recommendations of the World Summit on Children held in New York, United States in 1990.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many decades now, numerous studies have indicated that giving children additional vitamin A in form of supplements has great impact on lowering infant mortality figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a meeting sponsored by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund that was held in Guatemala, South America last September, delegates from Third World Nations were informed that the South American nation had substantially boosted child health through simple measures of fortifying sugar with vitamin A. Sugar is a common food commodity consumed daily by millions of children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vitamin A is beneficial because it helps boost the immune system. It protects the mucous membranes which form a barrier against the entry of germs which cause gastrointestinal diseases like diarrhoea and respiratory tract diseases like pneumonia, tonsils, gum diseases etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commissioner of Health Services in charge of Nutrition Dr. D. Lwamafa urged the Task Force to expedite the sugar fortification plan by working hand in hand with the sugar industries in Uganda. They should also suggest alternative foodstuffs consumed by the majority of Ugandans into which vitamin A may be fortified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNICEF Uganda programme officer Dr. Van Steiteghen said the UN body had consented to import the initial consignment of vitamin A premix preparation for fortifying sugar on a pilot basis. Uganda would however have to build its own factory to make vitamin A in bulk once the pilot programme is over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Van Steiteghen was happy that Uganda would be the first country in Africa to implement the fortification of sugar with vitamin A. The fortification plans would be implemented in such a way as to ensure that consumers do not take an excess of this vitamin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Natural sources of vitamin A are milk, butter, greens and yellow fruits like mangoes and carrots. Fish, liver and nuts are also good sources of this vitamin.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI (APS) - Despite the 1994 genocide that left Rwanda totally devastated, this Central African country has one of the leading financial networks for low income women in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was revealed by the Africa regional coordinator of the Women's World Banking (WWB) Ms. Phyllis Wanjiku Kibui, during the opening of the WWB biannual global meeting here from November 4 to 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with APS, Ms. Kibui said the Rwandese women through their financial trust body, Duterimbere (go forward) had remarkably mobilised themselves into groups in order to become self-sustaining.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to APS, the President of Duterimbere Vinantie Rukarugonwa, said her organization has a membership which increases by ten per cent every month throughout the country. She attributes this to the adverse effects of the war that left 70 per cent of the Rwandese women as widows and orphans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rukarugonwa noted that Duterimbere was involved in the reconciliation process to create a good economic climate and also set good ground for their future prospect of establishing a cooperative bank to support the women better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officiating at the opening of the meeting, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya Dr. Nzioki Kibua, called on WWB to break the cultural and racial barriers that hinder potential women borrowers from acquiring loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Kibua urged WWB to empower women as investors and equip them with business knowledge to distinguish between family income and business income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the more than 100 participants drawn from over 40 global countries, WWB President Nancy Barry, said the week-long meeting will reflect on strategies of creating effective systems which give low income women entrepreneurs access to banking services, markets and information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barry hailed the Kenya Women's Finance and Credit Trust (KWFCT) for its leading clientele of about 6,200 low income women. She explained that WWB is targeting a total of 100 million beneficiaries by the year 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Established in 1979, Women's World Banking is a United States-based non- profit making financial institution, designed to exclusively address the needs of low income women in the world by advocating for their recognition in the banking systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Africa, women's financial and credit trusts have taken root in Senegal, Gambia, Kenya, Uganda, Zambia, Mali, Ghana and South Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ENUGU-EASTERN NIGERIA (APS) - The Spiritan International School of Theology (SIST), eastern Nigeria, in collaboration with other missionary and Catholic institutes in Nigeria, will from (today) November 11 to 17 hold a continental research congress aimed at proposing paths of solution to the crises bedevilling the African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The symposium whose theme is, Africa: Towards Priorities of Mission is expected to bring together experts who live or have lived in conflict situations and are searching for ways of reconciliation in the service of the Kingdom of God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our congress has the aim of bringing together people of hope, people committed to the creation of a better tomorrow for Africans and for the world community,&quot; says the letter of invitation, signed by the congress co- ordinator, Father E.E. Uzukwu.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participation in the get-together is strictly by invitation and the participants have been selected either because of their experience on the various spheres of life which challenge Africans today and/or because of their expertise in proposing solutions to these problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not more than 70 participants are expected to take part in the Enugu congress. Of the total number, two thirds will be from Africa and the remaining from the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those invited from East Africa are Prof. John Waligo of Uganda, formerly of the Catholic University of Eastern Africa, Nairobi, and active in the development of democratic institutions in Uganda and Father Kizito Renato Sesana of the Nairobi-based Sudan Catholic Information Office (SCIO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The congress will follow the process of the inductive method, beginning with the narration of experiences by some participants. The narratives are expected to shape the themes to be discussed in the workshops, in which four major papers lasting not more than 40 minutes each, will be presented in the plenary assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is in the process of discussions, interactions, sharing experiences in the workshops, assembling emerging conclusions for debates in plenary assembly that our research may start proposing the shape of mission in Africa at the beginning of the third millennium,&quot; Fr. Uzukwu says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Topics to guide narration of experiences include inter-ethnic conflicts/relations with particular reference to Rwanda, Burundi, Ethiopia and Sudan, reconciling races in South Africa and economic/political oppression in Malawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others are Africa in the Diaspora, missionaries as victims of violence, inter-religious conflict/relations and oppressive religious experiences.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOGADISHU (APS) - The much-heralded peace deal between Somalia's warring clan factions in the Kenyan capital last October appears to have ended on the rocks following a series of new fighting that has left more than 40 people dead in the Horn of Africa country in the past one week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The peace deal was concluded on October 15 after one week of protracted negotiations under the mediation of Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi during which Somali's three leading warlords declared a ceasefire after their first face-to-face talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hussein Mohamed Aideed, Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Osman Hassan Ali &quot;Atto&quot; declared in a joint communique a &quot;cessation of hostilities ... With immediate effect,&quot; and agreed that they would allow free movement of people in Mogadishu, the divided capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also agreed to remove all roadblocks leading from one region to another, halt &quot;media propaganda,&quot; and facilitate delivery of humanitarian aid, and pledged to continue dialogue, and at the same time urged Moi to continue his mediation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All three warlords control part of the war-battered capital, with their territories delineated by &quot;green lines&quot; which only some can cross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aideed, 34, a former United States marine, took over leadership of his faction after the death in August of his father, General Mohamed Farah Aideed, who died from wounds received in a Mogadishu battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Osman Atto was General Aideed's financier, supporting him in his battles against US and United Nations troops, but split with him early last year and formed his own faction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But pledges were never kept, as roadblocks and green lines continued to exist until several days ago when the situation was let loose again in the Somali capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 21 people were killed and 50 wounded on October 30 when militiamen of Osman Atto attacked and occupied an airstrip 50 kilometres south of Mogadishu, according to survivors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Osman Atto's forces used more than eight armed wagons known as technicals to attack the airport, which was under the control of rival warlord Hussein Mohamed Aideed, the survivors said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lightning attack came as planes were landing at the airstrip to deliver khat, green narcotic leaves, from Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attack, which was seen here as a major blow to the Nairobi peace accord, followed another on October 29 in south Mogadishu, during which gunmen massacred 17 people and wounded 20 others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During that attack, about 15 armed men in a pick-up truck opened fire indiscriminately with machine-guns and grenades at the Bar Ubah junction, killing eight men and one woman instantly, with others dying of their wounds shortly afterwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gunmen, who according to witnesses did not appear to be targeting anyone in particular, sped off in the pick-up after apparently running out of ammunitions. No faction has claimed responsibility for the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 30, two more people died and several others were wounded in an exchange of fire at one checkpoint between supporters of north Mogadishu strongman and those of a respected Islamic leader, forcing the evacuation of expatriate aid workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supporters of Ali Mahdi and those of north Mogadishu's Islamic Courts chairman Sheikh Ali Sheikh Mohamed, popularly known as Sheikh Ali Dhere, put up barricades in readiness for a showdown with each other early October 30, after a dispute triggered by a decree issued by Ali Mahdi on October 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In effect, it changed the name of the Supreme Islamic Courts Implementation Council to that of Supreme Judiciary Council, and also named one of Aideed's close associates as the new chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decree also sacked Sheikh Ali Dhere from the chairmanship of the Islamic Courts and instead named him as the secretary general of the new judicial council, a decision disputed by his supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the night of October 30, Sheikh Ali Dhere addressed the people of north Mogadishu through the radio, telling them that he &quot;accepted Ali Mahdi's move on the Islamic Courts&quot; and appealed to them &quot;to exercise maximum restraint and avoid all evil things and behaviour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The October 30 exchange of fire between the two rival groups and the tension it has generated, has forced international aid agencies to evacuate their remaining essential expatriate staff from the war- torn Somali capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 5, the fighting spread to south Mogadishu, where at least 14 people were killed and more than a dozen others wounded, during an exchange of heavy gunfire in Medina and Hodon residential districts between fighters of Hussein Mohamed Aideed and those of Osman Hassan Ali Atto.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Discussion between both leaders focused on &quot;cooperation on the bilateral level and within the Tunisian-European framework,&quot; said the Tunisian official Presidential Spokesman.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ben Ali outlined the characteristics of the current business climate which &quot;provides optimal conditions for investment promotion especially in the framework of joint ventures and the upgrading of economic relations to the level of the strong political will which binds both countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Tunisian and German leaders discussed also &quot;the promising prospects of development of bilateral relations in the fields of investment, environmental protection, vocational training and the upgrading of the Tunisian economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ben Ali also &quot;expressed his appreciation for the support given to Tunisia by Germany and its disposition to boost its cooperation with Tunisia.&quot; &quot;This support manifested itself in the assistance given to Tunisia towards the implementation of its developmental projects and programs as well as in partnerships with the European Community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two leaders discussed international issues as well, especially the Middle East Peace Process &quot;emphasizing the need to salvage this process and give it a boost in order to spare the region the risks of conflicts and tension,&quot; added the Tunisian official Presidential Spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ben Ali met this afternoon with Mr. Joseph Fischer, Spokesman for the Green Parliamentary Group (Alliance 90.) Discussions focused on Tunisian- German cooperation in the protection of the environment, said the Tunisian official Presidential Spokesman, who noted that Mr. Fischer expressed his &quot; appreciation for President Ben Ali's great concern for environmental issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ben Ali also met today with Oscar Lafontaine, Chairman of the Social Democratic Party SPD. The focus of the meeting according to the Tunisian official Presidential Spokesman, was the traditional ties of dialogue and exchange between the Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD) and the prospects of intensifying such ties.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - A heavy security presence in Ogoniland prevented the public and peaceful commemoration yesterday of the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his eight Ogoni colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'On 10 November, the anniversary of the executions, the Nigerian authorities announced, with apparent satisfaction, that their law and order operations had successfully prevented public commemorations,' Amnesty International said today. 'These attempts should be a source of shame for the government, not satisfaction.'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although some vigils and church services did go ahead in Ogoniland and in other parts of the country, many planned activities and commemorations in Port Harcourt, the capital of Rivers State where the executions took place, did not go ahead.  The government's 4 November threat to &quot;deal ruthlessly&quot; with public demonstrations appears to have had the desired intimidatory effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The security presence in Ogoniland and Port Harcourt has been heavy for several weeks, with at least 20 members of the Ogoni ethnic group reportedly arrested. Goi Aadum, Bariaara Kpalap, Duba Aazor and Kenwin Meneta are among those who apparently remain in detention without charge or trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International believes that those arrested have been detained solely for peacefully expressing their political views and fears that the Ogoni detainees may have been ill-treated while in detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International restates its appeal to the international community that now is the time to redouble efforts to end contempt for human rights in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The crisis in Ogoniland cannot be solved without an end to the all- pervasive contempt for human rights which the Nigerian Government displays,' the organization said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of a campaign it launched on 6 November, Amnesty International has published a 10-point program for human rights reform in Nigeria. The organization continues to call on the Nigerian Government to commit itself to a genuine and far-reaching program of human rights reform and urges the international community to press Nigeria to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 8 November three Amnesty International officials were stopped at a police checkpoint in Lagos on their way to a meeting with foreign diplomats, interrogated and released after 12 hours. One was subsequently deported from the country.  The other two, senior officials of the organization's Nigerian Section, have since been ordered to report to the police for several hours every day.  The Section's office in Lagos has been forcibly closed by the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Patrice Vahard, Amnesty International's representative from its International Secretariat, was speaking on behalf of Amnesty International's Secretary General who had been denied entry to the country,' the organization said.  'He was threatened by a senior police officer and told that there is an embargo on visits by Amnesty International, including by its Secretary General.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The human rights organization is calling for an end to the harassment of Amnesty International's Nigerian Section and of all organizations engaged in the peaceful advocacy of human and political rights in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - Today's arrest of trade unionists gathering to peacefully demonstrate in support of striking junior doctors and nurses shows the Zimbabwean Government's inability to tolerate dissenting voices, Amnesty International said today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Human rights do not appear to be faring well in Zimbabwe, when nurses, students and concerned citizens are tear gassed and hit with batons simply for protesting against government policy,' the organization said as it called for the immediate release of all those detained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The message sent by the Zimbabwean Government seems to be clear: remain silent or risk arrest.'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 50 Zimbabwean riot police this morning fired teargas and used batons in downtown Harare to break up a planned protest march by trade unions, churches and human rights groups. Earlier, the Zimbabwean Government issued an order banning public demonstrations in support of thousands of nurses and junior doctors who went on strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police took five organisers of the march into custody, including two union leaders, but it was not clear on what grounds they were arrested. When the people dispersed, the police allegedly began beating some of the 200 people trying to leave the scene. Several people were reportedly injured in the melee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International is particularly concerned about the arrests of Morgan Tsvangirai and Isaac Matongo, the secretary-general and vice president respectively of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), as well as the earlier arrest of the head of the Zimbabwe Teachers Union. The organization believes that all those arrested are prisoners of conscience and should be immediately and unconditionally released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International confirmed several instances of brutal assaults on peaceful protestors, including instances of police assault and tear-gassing of University of Zimbabwe students. Last week, nurses and junior doctors were sacked for striking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, of which Zimbabwe is a signatory, guarantee the right to freedom of expression, freedom of association and freedom to assemble in public. These rights are also enshrined in the Zimbabwe constitution, including its declaration of rights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Sudan - Complex Emergency - Situation Report No. 1, Fiscal Year (FY) 1997, November 12, 1996, U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT, BUREAU FOR HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE (BHR, OFFICE OF U.S. FOREIGN DISASTER ASSISTANCE (OFDA).  Note: The last situation report was dated June 10, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BACKGROUND</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting began in 1983 between the Government of Sudan (GOS) and the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) when the southern-based rebels demanded more influence in the government and protested the GOS efforts to &quot;Islamize&quot; the Christian and animist south. In 1991, the SPLA split into factions, and intensified fighting between SPLA factions erupted in areas of the south. The conflict continues today and civilians throughout the south and the transitional zone (the area of southern Darfur, southern Kordofan, northern Bahr el Ghazal, and the northern Upper Nile States) are directly affected by aerial bombings by the GOS and forced relocations due to fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ongoing insecurity and population displacement in the south and the transitional zone have not only interrupted or destroyed most of the indigenous trading and productive systems, but have also been a major impediment to relief efforts. The United Nations (U.N.) and numerous international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) within and outside the framework of Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) are delivering relief assistance by airlifts, airdrops, barges, trains, and truck convoys. In the more secure areas of southern Sudan, efforts to rehabilitate and restore self-sufficiency are underway.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NUMBERS AFFECTED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the U.N. Humanitarian Coordination Unit (UNHCU), an estimated 2.5 million Sudanese are internally displaced, including 1.8 million in Khartoum, 350,000 in the transition zone and government-held garrison towns, 150,000 in camps in Equatoria, and additional tens of thousands elsewhere. In addition, Sudanese continue to flee from southern Sudan because of insecurity and civil strife. Currently, there are an estimated 399,500 Sudanese refugees in neighboring countries: 27,500 in the Central African Republic; 220,000 in Uganda; 60,000 in Ethiopia; 60,000 in Zaire; and 32,000 in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Sudan is currently hosting an estimated 340,000 refugees, including 300,000 Eritreans and 40,000 Ethiopians. UNHCR hopes to repatriate 100,000 Eritreans in 1997, provided that agreement on modalities can be reached between the governments of Sudan and Eritrea. Repatriation of Ethiopian refugees from camps in Sudan is almost completed, and UNHCR has begun the repatriation of Ethiopians who live outside the camps in Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Total USAID Assistance for Fiscal Year 1996. . . . . .$41,929,652</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CURRENT SITUATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disease, flooding, and drought conditions have exacerbated the poor conditions of war-affected populations in Sudan. A cholera outbreak, which was first reported in June, reportedly killed at least 700 people, mostly in Bahr el Ghazal. Recent reports of measles in western Upper Nile and Bahr el Ghazal are also of concern, and responses are underway. Over 200 people were also killed, crop areas damaged, and an estimated 40,000 homes destroyed by flooding of the Nile River and heavy rains in Khartoum, White Nile, River Nile in the north, and Upper Nile/Jonglei.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unusually heavy rains also had a detrimental effect on the health and nutritional status of populations in squatter areas and displaced camps around greater Khartoum. Additionally, an estimated 1 million people are suffering from food shortages in northern Bahr el Ghazal, North Kordofan, and the Red Sea Hills region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 16, the GOS, under intense international pressure, lifted restrictions that were imposed on C-130 aircraft last September. This enabled OLS to airdrop food and other relief items to over 700,000 people severely affected by food shortages and floods in southern Sudan. As of October, WFP, through OLS, airdropped approximately 4,000 metric tons (MT), primarily in northern Bahr el Ghazal, Upper Nile, and Jonglei. OLS was able to deliver only 20% of assessed needs from January to June, using smaller, less cost- effective aircraft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first review of OLS was completed in August and released to the U.N., donors, and relief agencies. The review was conducted by external consultants, and, while supporting the continuation of OLS, recommended a number of changes. Major recommendations included the following: OLS should more aggressively pursue humanitarian access to all war-affected populations in Sudan; OLS should separate relief and rehabilitation activities from the development process set forward by the GOS, while at the same time increasing the use of relief/rehabilitation assistance to strengthen the coping mechanisms of local communities; and OLS should improve the integration of the northern and southern sector programs, including the application of humanitarian principles and ground rules dissemination in the northern sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The review team also recommended a stronger coordination role for the U.N.  Department of Humanitarian Affairs (UNDHA) in selecting and managing the lead U.N./OLS representative and in staffing, upgrading, and managing the UNHCU.  Further suggested was the establishment of international and locally-based advisory committees comprising U.N. agencies, major donors, and NGOs. On September 25, the review team met with donors, U.N. agencies, and NGOs to discuss recommendations. The team subsequently met with representatives from the GOS and the rebel factions. Details from the meetings and a plan of action are being prepared by the U.N.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">POLITICAL/MILITARY SITUATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 16, 1996, the U.N. Security Council (UNSC) adopted Resolution 1070 which would ban international flights by aircraft owned, leased, or controlled by Sudan Airways or another entity of the GOS. The UNSC will meet in mid-November to assess whether Sudan has complied with its obligations under UNSC resolutions to extradite to Ethiopia three fugitive suspects in the 1995 assassination attempt on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and to desist from its involvement in terrorism. If Sudan remains in non-compliance, the UNSC may decide to proceed with implementation of the international air ban on Sudanese aircraft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current U.N. sanctions on Sudan include restricted international travel for GOS officials, a ban on holding international conferences in Sudan, and a call on nations to reduce the size of Sudanese diplomatic missions abroad.  The GOS has condemned the latest sanction, linking it to an attack on Islam and continues to claim that the alleged terrorists are not in Sudan. The GOS has carried out numerous bombing raids in southern Sudan, including targets in Maridi, Tambura, and Kotobi in Western Equatoria. In Maridi, 30 relief personnel were present in the town during a bombing which wounded four Sudanese civilians. In Tambura, five civilians were wounded when one bomb landed between the CARE and International Medical Corps (IMC) compounds, endangering 14 relief personnel present within the compounds. In early July, Christian Solidarity International charged that the GOS used internationally- banned cluster bombs against civilians near Chukudum. The GOS has denied these allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late September, GOS warplanes dropped about 10 bombs on the northwestern Ugandan town of Moyo. No casualties were reported. The bombing followed an Iranian-mediated pact signed in early September between the Governments of Sudan and Uganda to consolidate efforts to clamp down on rebel activity on the border. The Sudanese government admitted the attack but claimed it was a mistake. Uganda broke diplomatic relations with Sudan last April. Eritrea and Sudan also broke relations in 1995, and tensions are elevated between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late October, reports of a plot to topple the National Islamic Front (NIF)-led government headed by Omar Hassan al-Bashir emerged. This is the third report of a coup attempt in Sudan this year. The GOS acknowledged an attempted coup in March and in August arrested 65 former soldiers in connection with an alleged plot to attack government targets in Port Sudan and undermine the NIF regime. The GOS has also reportedly conducted arrests of civilians in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In early October, the National Democracy Alliance (NDA), a coalition of Sudanese opposition groups based in Asmara, announced the formation of a joint military force which includes the SPLA, the Sudan Alliance Forces, and the Beja Congress. Since early July, the NDA has increased attacks on GOS- controlled areas near the Red Sea military zone, resulting in casualties near Kassala and Tokar towns and around Garora refugee camp. WFP suspended food deliveries to the camp in eastern Sudan in July due to insecurity, including two land mine explosions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July, SPLA/M leader John Garang met with State Department and BHR/OFDA officials, as well as NGO representatives, while in Washington. During the visit, Garang lobbied for lifting, in rebel-held areas, current U.S.  Government (USG) legislation which bans development aid in Sudan. In August, Garang visited refugee camps in Koboko in northern Uganda with assistance from the Government of Uganda (GOU). He urged the refugees to return to Sudan during his visit. Between 10,000 and 17,000 refugees have reportedly returned from northern Uganda since late July. There are between 200,000 to 230,000 Sudanese refugees in Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July, 100 refugees, mostly women and children, were killed and thousands displaced when the GOS-supported Lords' Resistance Army (LRA) rebels attacked the Agago/Acholi Pii refugee camp near Kitgum. An additional 2,000 were displaced and about 45 families abducted. Among those missing and feared abducted were a WFP truck driver and two policemen. The rebels reportedly burned 300 huts at the camp, which housed more than 16,000 refugees. Trucks belonging to WFP and an Italian NGO also were destroyed. OLS temporarily closed the main road from Kitgum and Labone, because of attacks by LRA forces and recent land mine explosions which have injured NGO staff. All U.N. and NGO staff in northern Uganda were relocated to Kampala temporarily due to recent attacks on NGO compounds. In October, unidentified gunmen thought to belong to LRA launched two separate attacks on Sudanese refugee camps in northern Uganda, killing 16 and seriously wounding five. Several huts were looted and burned by the attackers and many refugees fled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From June to August, the SPLA lost control of two towns. Lui, in Western Equatoria, was taken by the GOS, following fierce fighting that displaced thousands of people and forced NGO staff to temporarily evacuate. Riek Machar's South Sudan Independence Movement (SSIM) faction also seized Akobo in Jonglei region. Recent SPLA gains include the capture of Pochalla town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In early October, the SPLA/United faction, led by Lam Akol, set two Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC) relief workers free, two weeks after they were abducted while on board a WFP barge between the towns of Renk and Malakal. Both men were taken to Malakal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late August, six Roman Catholic missionaries who had been held for nearly two weeks by the SPLA were released. The six missionaries, including an American priest, were released at the mission compound in Mapourdit where they had been detained by a local SPLA commander who had accused them of being spies and promoting Islam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RELIEF EFFORTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Site visits for the OLS southern sector have been completed. The northern sector assessment has suffered from delays but is now moving forward with six task forces comprised of NGO, GOS, and U.N. team members. The results of the two assessments will form the basis of the 1997 OLS Appeal. The U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/UNICEF/WFP Household Food Security Assessment was finished in October and indicated that in government-held areas in the south, Juba, Jonglei, Gogrial, and Aweil will be the hardest hit in the coming months due to flooding, insecurity, and crop disease. The annual FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment, which covers the crop situation in the whole of Sudan, is expected to begin in mid-November. This assessment gathers data at the end of the second harvest and also serves as the basis for the U.N. inter-agency consolidated appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medecines sans Frontieres/Belgium (MSF/B) has reported 19 cases of measles in Mapel, Wau County, since October, including 2 deaths. Treatment and a vaccination campaign are underway under MSF/B's ongoing BHR/OFDA-funded health program in the area. This is the latest of a series of measles outbreaks in western Upper Nile and Bahr el Ghazal. A coordinated response, including community mobilization and immunization and involving a number of NGOs and local counterparts, is underway under OLS. Several NGOs also responded to the outbreak of cholera in Bahr el Ghazal. BHR/OFDA grantees Christian Medical Aid (CMA), MSF/B, Action Contre la Faim (ACF), and International Rescue Committee (IRC) participated in efforts to successfully control the outbreak. In Khartoum, NGOs responded to an outbreak of diarrhea in the displaced camps from July to October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--Equatoria</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, the GOS continues to impose restrictions on certain flights as well as rebel-held locations in southern Sudan, including Chukudum and Nimule.  The area south of the Kapoeta-Torit-Juba and Juba-Yei-Kajo Keji lines is currently in the no-flight exclusion zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--Upper Nile/Jonglei</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international donor community provided urgently-needed assistance in response to the floods that ravaged Sudan this summer. In June, flooding of the Akobo River destroyed 85 to 100% of all crops and 30% of all homes in Pochalla and surrounding towns, affecting an estimated 18,000 people in the worst flooding the town has experienced in 50 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July, U.S. Ambassador to Sudan Timothy Carney declared a disaster in Pochalla due to the flooding. BHR/OFDA and USAID's Office of Food for Peace (BHR/FFP) immediately responded by providing funds and 1,150 MT of food to Norwegian People's Aid (NPA), which operates outside the OLS umbrella. The funds were used to transport urgently needed items to displaced persons in the Pochalla area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In early August, following GOS approval for the resumption of relief flights to Pochalla, OLS began air dropping urgently needed food rations to an initial 15,000 people and conducted assessments in accessible areas using C-130 and Buffalo aircraft. These activities were subsequently interrupted in September, when all flights to Pochalla were re-denied by the GOS. Another non-OLS NGO, MSF/France, provided emergency assistance to 43,000 people in Pochalla with partial support from BHR/OFDA. The GOS ban was finally reversed in October, allowing OLS relief flights to resume. It is estimated that assistance will be required for flood-affected areas in Pochalla through the end of the January 1997 harvest. Several towns in Upper Nile/Jonglei, including Malakal, Tonga, Nasir, Sobat, Pibor, Motot, Waat, and surrounding areas, were also severely hit by floods. Ongoing programs in these areas are attempting to address the needs of the flood-affected population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--Bahr el Ghazal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attacks reportedly carried out by Kerubino forces in Gogrial have negatively affected the food security in the area. In response, WFP and UNICEF are delivering relief commodities in Agaigai, Ajiep, and Madhol.  BHR/OFDA is also funding a grant to World Vision Relief and Development (WVRD) to assess and respond to the increased level of vulnerability among the populations in Tonj and Gogrial counties of the Lakes area. In early November, Kerubino forces detained an International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) aircraft in Wunrok, northern Gogrial. The aircraft was returning patients who had been wounded and evacuated following recent fighting in the town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--Khartoum</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September, U.S. Ambassador Timothy Carney declared a disaster in areas of northern Sudan affected by heavy flooding. BHR/OFDA subsequently released $25,000 to Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) to distribute locally-manufactured tents to meet the shelter needs of displaced residents.  Ongoing programs in the Khartoum displaced camps were used to address the needs of flood-affected camp dwellers. According to the GOS, areas in El Gayli in Khartoum and Umbadda, Marzoub, and Abu Said in Omdurman province were severely hit by the floods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A USAID team traveled to Khartoum and Kordofan in October to visit existing programs and meet with NGOs, U.N. agencies, and GOS officials regarding constraints to program implementation and future program needs. GOS restrictions continue to frustrate the provision of assistance in the camps and squatter areas located in the Khartoum area. NGO/U.N. efforts to ensure better coordination and to plan long-term strategies for the Khartoum displaced are underway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--Kordofan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July, Save the Children Federation/US (SCF/US) and CARE reported that northern Kordofan was facing severe food shortages as a result of a poor 1995 cereal harvest caused mainly by a lack of rainfall at critical growth stages.  As part of a joint operation with SCF/US, CARE secured funding and issued tenders for 10,000 MT of cereals in surplus areas of Gedarif for delivery to northern and western Kordofan. Program implementation was initially delayed due to GOS restrictions on the movement of grain from Gedarif. In late October, CARE was able to purchase and move 4,000 MT of sorghum for distribution by CARE and SCF/US to vulnerable villagers. Preliminary results from CARE's mid-season crop assessment survey indicate some rural councils in north and west Kordofan will exhaust their harvest by January 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USAID representatives visited drought-affected villages in North Kordofan and returnee villages in the Nuba Hills during their recent visit. In North Kordofan, it is likely that increased relief efforts will need to be mounted in February to fill food gaps. In South Kordofan, SCF/US is providing health, water, and food security assistance in Dilling and Rashad provinces and hopes to expand activities to Kadugli province soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--Northeast regions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In early summer, the GOS and several NGOs reported the existence of alarmingly high malnutrition rates among rural populations in the Red Sea Hills area. In September, the reports indicated that an estimated 240,000 people, mostly agro-pastoralists, were at risk of starvation due to successive droughts, food deficits, and livestock reduction, among other factors. The International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), UNICEF, WFP, and Oxfam are collaborating on efforts to respond to the immediate needs of the affected population and to deter further displacement of the rural population to urban areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June, the GOS deported 224 Eritrean and 20 Ethiopian refugees in Kassala amid growing tension in the northeastern region. Approximately 28,000 Ethiopians participated in an organized repatriation between December 1995 and the present. About 15,000 remain in camps and an undetermined number are living outside of camps. UNHCR hopes to complete all organized repatriations of Ethiopians from Sudan in 1997. There are now over 60,000 Sudanese refugees in Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ASSISTANCE PROVIDED BY THE USG</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The USG has actively been providing humanitarian assistance to Sudan since 1988. On October 28, 1996, Ambassador Carney renewed the disaster declaration for Sudan for FY 1997, stating that continued U.S. assistance is required to assist over 3 million war-affected and displaced Sudanese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The USG's humanitarian response to the disaster in Sudan is provided through BHR/OFDA, BHR/FFP, and the State Department's Bureau for Population, Refugee, and Migration (PRM). On January 31, 1996, the United States announced that it was suspending its diplomatic presence in Khartoum, due to concerns for the safety of American Embassy personnel in Sudan. Subsequently, Ambassador Carney established a temporary office in Nairobi to maintain regular diplomatic communications with the GOS. He and his staff visit Sudan periodically. Both BHR/OFDA and BHR/FFP staff in Washington work with remaining USAID/Sudan Foreign Service National staff in Khartoum to provide ongoing monitoring of relief programs in GOS-controlled areas. Continued relief activities in southern Sudan are also monitored by the Regional Economic Development Services Offices/Sudan Field Office (REDSO/SFO).  (BHR/OFDA supports a program officer currently based in Nairobi as part of the SFO).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Questions and answers by spokesman Michael McCurry at the November 13 briefing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Mike, the President has just been reelected after a campaign in which he promised repeatedly, spoke repeatedly of the need for the United States to lead in the world. Here we have the first international crisis out of the box and somebody else is leading. Why?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: Well, the President has said many times that the United States sometimes has unique leadership responsibilities in this world. But at the same time, he has indicated that we are not the world's superpoliceman to address each and every condition that exists anywhere in the world. In fact, it is encouraging that in this case a very close and trusted ally of the United States, the government of Canada, has stepped forward and offered to put together this force. We nonetheless see how important it is for us to participate in it.  I think there are others who would be more likely to participate given U.S. participation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as we did in Goma in 1994, we confine our role sometimes in efforts to address situations like this to those areas where we can provide unique capabilities. Now, we've got some unique capabilities we can provide here in terms of airlift, providing assistance in logistics, and we do recognize the importance of having a U.S. force participate on the ground in some aspects of the mission itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Can you explain how Canada came to be the big player here? Usually the lead player will be someone with historic or other special, vital interests in the place. What happened here? Was the United States just not particularly attuned to this because of the campaign, or what happened?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: No, not at all. In fact, I would go back two weeks. We have had a series of very senior diplomats working with other governments that do, as you say, have some historic interests on the continent, working to address the finding. Ambassador Richard Bogosian, who's been our special coordinator for Rwanda and Burundi, has been in place in the region for some time working between Kinshasa and Kigali to attempt to bridge the differences, attempt to negotiate a cease-fire. He's been working very closely with Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's representative, Ambassador Chretien, who is Prime Minister Chretien's nephew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These diplomatic efforts so far have produced discussion; they have not produced the kind of agreement for a cease-fire in place that we would want to see as one of the conditions in understanding what the threat environment would be.  Nor have they produced a general agreement so far about the insertion of a force. Now, that relates to your question. There have been concerns expressed in the region about some who have stepped forward in the international community to suggest that they should play a lead role. That was one of the things that, diplomatically, we needed to work through in our consultations, and sometimes those with historic ties in the region are in a less -- less favorable circumstances arise for their leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's clearly what happened here. It's one of the things that we have attempted to address. It's one of the reasons why, for well over two weeks now, we've been engaged in consultations and then very intensive telephone conversations that National Security Adviser Lake has had with the governments of Great Britain, France, Canada, and then others in the region within the last several days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Mike, you spoke of an overall force package of several thousand troops.  How many troops are you talking about on the ground in Zaire for perimeter security -- Goma and the corridor from the airport to the border?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: Well, the overall structure of that multinational force is one that will be determined as senior military commanders from various governments work together with their counterparts. General Shalikashvili has already had discussions of that nature with his counterparts, particularly with some of the Canadian uniformed officers that would be in a leadership role here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have anticipated in rough numbers and, again, you know, part of the assessment is still underway, a U.S. contribution here in the neighborhood of roughly 1,000 ground troops in Zaire. But I want to make clear that there could be several thousand beyond that that would participate in the ancillary activities -- establishing the air bridge, doing some of the logistics, other things that we've looked at.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we've got a general sense of the size of the U.S. contribution we're talking about, but, of course, that has to be fully integrated with those who will be offering troops from other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q In Zaire, you're talking about the airport and its relatively immediate environs?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: Talking about these things -- the things that I identified: the airport security around Goma airfield; the assistance in airlifting deployed forces; airfield services; provision of security along the corridor that they want to establish running from Goma over to the Rwanda border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q How long is that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: Three miles long, I believe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q So everybody on the ground in Zaire would be close to the airport, right?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: They would be in the general vicinity of Goma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q What's the outside number? You say several thousand. No more than --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: Well, the sources -- some of you have got sources from the Pentagon saying under 5,000. That even seems somewhat high based on some of the things I've seen. But that's probably an eyeball estimate, not a bad one, under 5,000.  I've heard other suggested it wouldn't be any higher than 4,000, but that will depend on, you know, again, the final cut on a mission plan that would be put together after we work through details. There would have to be some decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You know, this is -- I've given you a very good understanding now of what our conditions are, what are identification of a proper mission has been.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Going back to Brit's question, I'd say, really, for the last maybe three weeks this issue arose somewhat when Secretary Christopher was in Africa recently, because there was growing concern that some of the fighting might trigger another movement of refugees who have been parked over the border in Zaire. That did, indeed, happen. So we've watched that situation unfold in the time, really, since Secretary Christopher was in Africa. We've had, you know, urgent diplomatic consultations underway, had some of our folks working it, certainly working at the United Nations as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we began really about two weeks ago to -- first at a lower level and then moving up to the President's principal national security advisers. We'd be, again, addressing the question if there was going to be some type of multinational force to address this humanitarian situation, what should it look like. Part of the concern were a number of governments stepped forward initially with what we felt were less than complete offers of assistance, less than complete mission plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So we began working what would be the nature, duration of the mission; what was the reasonable probability of success in addressing the situation on the ground; and then how best could we work with other governments to address that need.  And, again, I would compliment the government of Canada, which worked through many of those same issues with us, arrived at -- based on the consultations that have occurred with the very acceptable definition of mission that allows us in principle to indicate our willingness to participate. We've now got to go back and get a final iron-through on that.  And, of course, the Security Council would have to authorize the mission under the terms that I stipulated to, a Chapter 7 mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q You talked about the potential for threat, and you have several thousand, tens of thousands of militia and other military people in the region. Do you have any agreement from them and do you have to have an agreement with their cooperation?  Also, a secondary question, will you feed them as well, if they are in those camps? How will you separate them from the --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: And, again, note that I said we would not make an effort to separate out militia forces. As a practical matter that would be next to impossible. At the same time, based on the work that Ambassador Bogosian has done, but more particularly and more directly the consultations that Ambassador Chretien has had on behalf of the United Nations, there would have to be agreements by both Rwanda and Zaire regarding this force and there would have to be an understanding by forces deployed on the ground, or at least those who are in a position to influence forces on the ground because the nature and makeup of some of the rebel factions in the region is a little difficult discern at times. But we know and believe that there are those who have got influence or are in a position to influence those forces. There would need to be an agreement that this would be a non-hostile environment for the insertion of a force. This is not a force that would be equipped or prepared to fight its way in. It would have to be a force that would go in with the complicity of governments in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q How do you get that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Do you have it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: Well, you get that through the diplomacy that's underway at this very moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q So you don't have that agreement right now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: No, and that's one of the reasons why the conditional acceptance of this mission, in our view, depends on gaining that type of assurance on the environment. At the same time, this is not a risk-free environment by any means, and it has to be a force that is prepared and equipped to defend itself, which is one of the reasons why our Pentagon has been so careful in addressing what the composition, size of the force would be, and what type of -- how it would be equipped to deal with any threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Mike, are you seeking those agreements from the regional governments and, if so, what guarantee do you have that these governments can control these militia forces?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: From governments in the region and others. That's because it's a complicated situation on the ground, with rival factions in one way or another allied with or perhaps allied with Tutsi factions, Hutu factions.  There has to be some general understanding of what the rules of the road would be on the ground, and that's what we're attempting to clarify now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q So when do you expect a final decision and some sort of announcement -- what sort of announcement by the President?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: Well, the President himself would want at the proper point to say we've worked some of the issues that remain. That will depend on how Tony Lake's consultations go, depend on what type of review the Security Council makes of the situation, it will depend on the reports we get from the assessment team that's gone in there to look at exactly these questions -- who controls the ground, what type of control structure does there exist for some of these factions, in many cases tribal leaders who may be allied with other factions in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q You could be talking about a week here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: Not necessarily. I mean, look, there are people -- if it is true that -- and we don't have any reason to doubt it -- if it's true that they've now got reported of cholera -- it's known that there is malnutrition - - we've got to close to a million people who are in peril and thousands of them who are about to die, so --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q When do you want to see the first troops go?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: -- we want to do it fairly urgently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q When?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Hours, days?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: When will be when we've got good assurance that these issues that we've identified can be satisfactorily resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Well, you're expecting that to be days, not weeks, not then?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: I would expect it to be days, and --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q But not hours?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: Maybe even hours. Tony Lake can work fast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Where would these forces come from? Which --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: Well, there have been some -- I mean, we would leave it to individual governments to announce their willingness to participate --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q I was talking about ours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: Where would ours be -- I can't tell you that. I can tell you that by the end of the week I expect the Pentagon would be in a position to brief you in greater detail on any force contribution the United States might make.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q But they wouldn't -- if they're briefing us on a force contribution at the end of the week, presumably that force would not have left by then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: No. But there would be -- presumably not have left. They would not have gotten a deployment order until the President is satisfied that he's in a position to make a deployment order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q So they couldn't leave before when?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: I don't --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q The forces couldn't leave before when at the earliest?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: I don't -- I haven't heard anything.  I can't make -- I can't even speculate on that at this point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Overall mission force size would be what?  We're talking about under 5, 000 --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: There have been public -- I don't want to dispute any of the public accounts that suggest a force between 10,000 and 15,000, which is what the Canadians have projected in some of the things that they've said publicly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Mike, this thing has Somalia written all over it in terms of the things you're trying to avoid -- the limitations you're putting on the mission.  Can you talk a little bit about how that permeated the President's thinking --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: Well, you know, a lot of the questions --why not now, why not now, why don't you go do something right away -- reflects our desire to have a very carefully constructed mission that avoids some of the pitfalls we've seen in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Mike, you say that we're not going to be disarming anyone; on the other hand, you want the food to get people back into the country. If you don't disarm the people that have essentially been holding people hostage, how do you get them to move?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: Well, the purpose of having a security force there is to make sure that it is an element of persuasion in allowing the humanitarian relief effort to do its work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Has the President --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q You can't disarm anyone? I mean, what kind of element of persuasion?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: Well, it is with robust rules of engagement and properly sized and tasked, we believe it would be in a position to be of assistance to those providing humanitarian relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Mike, will the U.N. play any role in this?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: Well, the Security Council would have to authorize, under Chapter 7, the deployment of a multinational force. It would be not unlike the kind of acceptance the Security Council gave to the U.N. mission in Haiti.  It would be that type of authorization by the Security Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q What other outside countries would U.S. troops be in? What countries outside Zaire?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: Well, I don't, as a rule -- we have not -- we would need to go an arrange hosting arrangements with those governments, but there are a number of governments in the general vicinity where we have successfully gotten assistance in the past. Maybe an indirect way of answering that question is, look back to the Goma operation in 1994 and look at the assistance we got from governments like Kenya, like Uganda, like Rwanda, and assume that we're talking about something that, while may be larger and more complicated and certainly somewhat more dangerous, a similar type of humanitarian effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Mike, what has been the breadth and depth of congressional consultation on this mission, and what have they said to you on both sides of the aisle?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: The President raised this with the leadership yesterday, as you know, and talked it through, and then there have been a series of consultation calls that have occurred this morning, walking leading members of the relevant congressional committees through some of those same things I've identified for you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Has there been any</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q What's the reaction?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: I'll let them speak for themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q But is the food only going to go into Zaire?  Would there be any food over the border back in Rwanda?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: The goal is to seek a voluntary repatriation back into Rwanda, so that one of the things they are looking at -- basically humanitarian routes or routings that would allow people to voluntarily return to Rwanda and there would need to be assurance of some provision of assistance for those who would need it, so there would have to be coordination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think, if I'm not mistaken, that some of the NGOs are doing work on both sides of the border already, so it wouldn't be confined to eastern Zaire or to the camps that have been established north and south of Lake Kivu, but it would be in that general vicinity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q How fast might food get there under the most optimistic scenario?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: Some is moving now, and one of the things we are watching very carefully is seeing how the arrangements that have been made for the movement of some humanitarian relief -- how is that working now, what kind of environment are relief workers finding themselves in as they do the work now.  It's been sporadic, but, in fact, up until two days ago, I think, it was impossible to get convoy traffic back and forth and impossible to move stuff from its landing point by truck into some of the camps. But they are now getting some relief supplies in. We're watching that carefully. And one of the things our team is doing out there is assessing how the humanitarian effort is doing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Mike, you mentioned four months. Do you expect significant repatriation by then, or the food problem to be solved, or why four months?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: One of the goals of the mission, the mission itself, would be to encourage and allow for voluntary repatriation, and ultimately allowing those innocent civilians who have fled Rwanda, allowing them to return to their lives, in western Rwanda principally, would be one of the goals, and that's ultimately one of the answers to the humanitarian situation that exists in the camps currently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q You talked about the need for a follow-on mission. Would that be to carry out the remainder of repatriation --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: As you look long term, it's clear there's going to be a significant humanitarian need in that region, as we've already seen over the last two-plus years a significant humanitarian need already. That's likely to continue, but the best answer is to get people to return to their homes and return to places where they can engage in subsistence farming and the activities they undertook before fleeing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Any time limit on the follow-on force?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: That's -- all we're indicating is that there would need to be further discussions about what type of follow-up work would be done after the estimated period of up to four months -- about four months where we think this deployment would be necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Can I just go back to where we started on this?  Why is it that Canada had so much clearer a notion of what it could and could not do so much earlier than we did?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: I think we had a pretty clear idea of what we would and would not do. We would not commit to an open-ended, ill-defined mission. We made that pretty clear in the consultations that we had. Canada has a historic role that they've played in peacekeeping operations. They obviously are proud of the work they have done. They were a key participant in the U.N. effort in Somalia, and had addressed this as a matter of some priority, I think in part because the Prime Minister's nephew was directly involved in the diplomacy.  The Prime Minister has said publicly that he was encouraged to develop plans more directly by the reports he got from his family members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q In your list of the conditions you did not talk about exit from the country, and even with your troop estimates it is possible the Americans could make up the bulk of troops if you took the under 5,000 and the 15,000 figure you're taking about. Nonetheless --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: No, we would make up significantly less than the bulk of the troops, as you can tell from what I outlined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q No, I mean, &quot;larger of the groups&quot; is the way I should have put that. But given that your entrance into Rwanda is minimally three miles, is there any commitment from the United States to assist any of the nations whose troops would be further into the countries should there be a problem that occurs or if this mission runs into serious trouble?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: I frankly would need to leave -- that's an operational question that would be best left to the commanding officers that would structure the force. As you see in the deployment we have underway in Bosnia right now, they've got procedural tactics that allow them to address any hostile environment that develops. They've got units that are deployed for that purpose. But that would be a question that would reside with the commanding officer, although our troops clearly would be engaged in the types of things I've already identified for you.  It doesn't indicate that type of role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q You talked about people being able to participate -- does that suggest that the rules of engagement have been determined?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: No, it suggests that there would be further discussions of rules of engagement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Has the President consulted leaders in the African-American community, like William Gray or Randall Robinson or Jesse Jackson?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: He has had discussions -- I mean, frankly, during the course of the campaign this subject came up very often in meetings that he had with African-American leaders.  The general humanitarian situation in Africa, particularly in Central Africa, in eastern Zaire in particular, is a subject he heard about often from leaders in the African-American community.  I am not aware that in the last 24 hours he has made specific calls of consultation, but he's certainly had an ongoing dialogue with leaders in the community on humanitarian conditions in Africa and, in fact, was very interested in some of the reports generally on those issues that Secretary Christopher carried back based on his recent trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, as you know, we had Mr. Lake and Mr. Tarnoff from the State Department were in Paris recently for consultations with President Chirac on a number of issues, but this subject came up and, as I say, it's been an avid subject of discussion within our government for some time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Mike, if the President was having consultations during the campaign, he certainly never spoke about this publicly out doing the campaign. Can you say why?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: Well, he had -- I mean, what I wanted to indicate is that this subject would come up from time to time as he met with African-American leaders much more urgently in that community -- came up questions that he addressed. In fact, I believe, if I'm not mistaken, he did talk from time to time about some of the concerns that had been raised by the leaders he met with. I know I can recall at least once or twice having briefed on some of the issues that have been raised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q But he never talked publicly about sending U.S. forces, yes?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: No, but we had a situation develop here literally within the last three weeks, roughly the last three weeks, in the closing period of the campaign, or in the last week of the campaign I think this situation grew more dire and certainly the situation has deteriorated even in the last seven days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Mike, this is one of the operations that we're sort of looking at in this present-day world; it's kind of a twilight area. Can you outline what the U.S.  interest is in going into this part of the world for this kind of purpose?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: Our interests here are largely humanitarian, to save lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q But that's a level of commitment that is required at this point?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: Well, look, the question was flipped around 180 degrees earlier -- why is Canada leading this effort.  And I should let the Canadian government speak to that. But we have had humanitarian interests in that region, we have fought to stave off famine, we've worked hard in the Horn of Africa to reduce the risks of famine. We have made a deployment of U.S.  forces to this exact region before to stem the effects of dehydration and malnutrition, and brought a unique capacity to bear in a very heroic effort to save lives. So we have an ongoing interest, humanitarian interest in saving the lives of refugees who are now at peril.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, of course, we have a larger interest in stemming the violence and the fighting that has occurred on both sides of the Rwandan-Zairian border. There have been enormous crimes, even crimes of genocide that have occurred in that area and we have obvious interest in doing what we can with the community of nations to address a situation of that nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Mike, what other countries have pledged troops at this point?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: There are I think about a dozen that have publicly identified themselves, or at least have responded.  Most of these discussions have come subsequent to the announcement by Canada yesterday that they would be willing to lead this force. I don't --I wouldn't want to attempt to list all dozen or so, but that's basically available and it's probably out -- been discussed publicly. We would leave it to individual participating countries to talk about their own contribution.  But a number of governments have said publicly now that they're willing to step forward. We think it's particularly important that this force include units from African nations, and that's the type of discussion that will be underway at the U.N.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Does the President plan to have an Oval Office address or some sort of address to the nation --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: No. But I should tell you this is not --as you know, we're dealing with another issue related to a deployment of U.S. forces overseas almost simultaneously, that's the question of what happens after the expiration of the current implementation force in Bosnia. And that, we've now been presented with an assessment of the four options that have been under review by NATO military commanders. There is a North Atlantic Council meeting that is upcoming on Monday that is going to really get more deeply into the question of what kind of force ought to be available in Bosnia after the expiration of the IFOR.  So that issue almost simultaneously the President has been addressing. I suspect sometime before departing he may want to speak publicly on both of these issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Mike, can you give us any kind of guidance on what nature of troops would be going? I mean, for military families who want to know, is my son going; what nature, where they might now be based.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: I think the Pentagon will be in the best position to do that, Debra. I do not know. I know that they are going to be some type of, you know, armed units, particularly in the vicinity of Zaire. But it would be best for the Pentagon to do that because they could satisfy exactly the concern you expressed, those who would be a part of the participating force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Mike, robust rules of engagement would presumably, as they always do, include the right for U.S. troops to defend themselves if fired upon. But would it extend to the protection of the refugees themselves? And is there a danger of falling into another Haiti situation, whereby U.S. troops were criticized for standing by and watching violence occur against civilians because their rules of engagement did not permit them to intervene at that time?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: I'd suggest otherwise. It says, as demonstrated in Haiti there was a capacity by those on the ground who are assessing the situation --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Well, eventually. Eventually there was, Mike, but initially their orders were to stand by and not intervene.  What would the orders be here? Would they, in fact, intervene to protect the refugees?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: We do not normally, in circumstances, go into detail on rules of engagement, but they would be sufficiently robust so forces could protect themselves and that they could account for a situation on the ground. But the mission priorities are the ones that I identified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Mike, one other question. I know there's so many layers to this, but if you were pushing for those people to be repatriated to their -- to Rwanda, are you going to get assurances from the Rwandan government that there will not be recriminations against these people once they go back?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: There would need to be understandings about what type of situation would exist. Now, there are 6 million Hutus that are living already in western Rwanda and living there largely peacefully who have not experienced that kind of danger. But there are clearly those who fear reprisals and who fear the situation that would exist if they return home.  And there are most likely a million-plus of them. Making sure that we can make the arrangements for them to peacefully return to their homes is part of the work that needs to be done diplomatically. What we can do is to assure through this operation that we can keep them alive while that type of longer term question is addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Can you briefly recap what the '94 operation was, how many troops were involved and what they did, where they --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: I can do it from memory, but I would probably get it wrong.  Let's see if maybe we can try to get something for you on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Can you take a quick question on a different subject?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q One more on this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: Yes, let's stay on this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Mike, can you say as of late yesterday afternoon the President was not yet ready to commit in principle.  Can you say what specifically was nailed down overnight in his meetings?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: Well, specifically last night, as Tony and the U.S. team met with the Canadian -- I'll let the government of Canada talk more about their delegation, but it was composed of uniformed officers from the Canadian military, representatives of their Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As they met they went through many of these same questions that I just identified. We have now really put together what is the, you know, intellectual or conceptual framework for a mission that needed to be agreed to with the Canadian government and really stipulate things like how the command and control arrangements would work, the nature of the assignment that would be tasked to the United States if we were willing to participate, those types of questions. And we had very good consultations with the Canadians last night and came to these agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Was that here, in New York, where was it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: They met here. They met here at the White House last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Tony is in New York today or he's going tomorrow?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: The President is sending him up there tomorrow. We think New York is -- there's some possibility, David heard that he might be going to Ottawa, we believe it's New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q Mike, I understand what you're saying about --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: He would then be available to other security council members that might want to have further consultations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q I understand what you're saying about why Canada would take the lead in this case, but was there a particular reason that the U.S. did not want to take the lead?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: There's a particular interest we have in making sure that in the world that we now live in, the post-Cold War era, others who share our values and share our principles and sometimes share our will to address situations like this do take on leadership roles when warranted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States will always have to remain a force of last resort to address questions that need attention based on our own assertion of self- interest and based on our own unique position as the lone superpower in the world. But it is encouraging to the United States that in this case we see a very close ally and friend, Canada, stepping forward to shoulder a larger burden on a matter like this because they believe it's right to do. And there are times in our foreign policy when it makes eminent good sense for us to work with governments that want to take on that role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We've seen around the world U.N peacekeeping operations -- I think particularly in the conduct of an election in Cambodia in which the government of Japan stepped forward and took a role. There are instances in which the United States can support those who share our values and share our interests in the world. And that's an encouraging thing in this world, because as the President has often said, the United States cannot be the world's superpoliceman of last resort. There are times when we obviously have to lead and sometimes where we have to lead alone.  It becomes a very lonely exercise and we've certainly seen instances of that in the last four years.  But there are times, encouraging to us, when we can share the burden with others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q So you're saying you don't want the U.S. to be the -- you want the U.S.  to be the force of last resort, not of first resort?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MR. MCCURRY: Well, it's the force of right resort, when it reflects our interest and it reflects the vital strategic interests that we have in the world and our humanitarian and other interests as we assert them around the world. The situation needs to be right when the United States is compelled to offer up that kind of leadership and it needs to right when we agree to join with others in addressing an urgent humanitarian concern of this nature.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Statement released by spokesman Michael McCurry, November 13, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States has been increasingly concerned that the humanitarian situation in eastern Zaire is deteriorating. There are thousands of lives that may be at risk by reports of a recent outbreak of cholera among the refugee population along the border and deeper now into Zaire. We've been working urgently to define the role a possible security force could play in a larger humanitarian operation in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of this process has involved extensive consultations with the government of Canada, which as I think many of you know, has offered to lead a multinational humanitarian force.  The United States welcomes Canada's offer to lead the multinational force. It's a move that will clearly demonstrate the will of others in the international community to assume a fair share of the burden for the operations that we project will be underway to save lives in Zaire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President reviewed our efforts to address the situation in Zaire this morning in a telephone call with Prime Minister Chretien. The conversation was around 11 o'clock this morning, lasted about 15 minutes. It really was a culmination of several days of work that have involved National Security Adviser Anthony Lake and others, working through the question of how to structure and stipulate the particulars of this type of humanitarian effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last night a delegation of senior Canadian officials met with a U.S.  delegation that was headed by National Security Adviser Lake, and those conversations resulted in a general agreement on the mission definition, command and control arrangements, and the duration of the mission. I'm going to walk through some of the particulars that we have now identified that will be addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'd say at first, though, to summarize it in general, the results of all the conversations that have occurred within the United States government, with those that we have consulted within the international community, and clearly the call between Prime Minister Chretien and the President, has led the President to decide that the United States is willing in principle to participate in a limited fashion in this humanitarian mission, as long as certain conditions are stipulated to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, we need to be able to validate some core assumptions that we made about the nature of the mission. Those regard the nature of the threat, the environment in which a multinational force would insert itself into the region, the availability of other properly trained and equipped forces so that it would truly be a multinational effort. And the consent of concerned countries in the region that would have to provide assistance in basing and routing so that the force could be effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, the mission of the force would have to be very clearly defined. The mission of the force would be both to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid by civilian relief organizations and to facilitate the voluntary repatriation of refugees by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. There is an extraordinary amount of very courageous work being done by nongovernmental organizations and others currently addressing the very desperate humanitarian situation that over a million refugees now face in the area. The principal goal is to assist them in their work and to make sure they can conduct their operations in a safe manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's also, simultaneously, a need to work with UNHCR to assure that those who have fled Rwanda can voluntarily repatriate themselves to their homes. In saying that, I would also say the mission of this force would not be to disarm militants, to conduct any type of forced entry, or to police some of the operations in the refugee camps that have now been established in the border region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, this force would operate as a multinational force. It would have very robust rules of engagement that military planners at the Pentagon have been exploring with their counterparts in other governments. Following, we would expect the United Nations Security Council to authorize this multinational force most likely in an effort led by Canada to bring the issue before the Security Council for their review. It would operate under Chapter 7 rules under the U.N. Charter. It would therefore not be what we would typically think of as a blue-helmet operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourth , the cost of the mission would be borne by participating states.  However, there need to be additional arrangements to support the participation by African nations. We think it's very important that forces from the region be a part of this multinational force, but clearly the costs of that should not be borne by those who would be force contributors, or at least should not be borne entirely by force contributors from the region.  There would have to be arrangements worked out to enlist the support of non- troop-contributing countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifth, we envision that the humanitarian mission as it has been defined and as we currently assess it would be of limited duration, about four months.  We're discussing with other nations the need for a follow-on presence beyond that time to ensure that there was not a return of the conditions that have led to this current humanitarian crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sixth, the contribution of the United States as we have identified the role that we could uniquely play in such an operation would consist of airport security around the airfield near Goma, which has been a principal point of delivery for humanitarian supplies and for those who are conducting relief operations, assistance in airlifting, deploying forces to the region -- in other words, participating in establishing the air bridge to the region, airfield services, the provision of security along approximately three-mile a corridor from Goma to the Rwandan border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And we anticipate a significant number of those U.S. troops that would be deployed as part of this mission would actually be based outside of Zaire in neighboring countries. So in total you might have a large force of several thousand -- different estimates now because we're still assessing what type of U.S. contribution would be made. But the bulk of our deployment to the region would not necessarily be in Zaire on the ground, although we would place forces on the ground in Zaire as part of the multinational effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As always, U.S. forces -- and I want to stress this -- U.S. forces would remain at all times under U.S. command while serving under the operational control of a commanding officer; in this case, the commanding officer would be a Canadian officer.  The United States would most likely provide the deputy commander to the Canadian commanding officer. But all the troops operating in Zaire would be under U.S. commanders. In other words, the tactical command structure would be with a U.S. commander in charge of units or forces deployed and they would retain, as they always would anywhere in the world, the direct chain of command authority to the Commander-In-Chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, where are we now? We've got, as some of you know, a military assessment team that has made its way to the region. They're assessing, obviously, things like the threat environment, what the security requirements would be, what type of infrastructure would be there to support the deployment of a force. We simultaneously have a humanitarian disaster assistance relief team from USAID that is present in the region just looking at what the humanitarian needs are. They are all, as they make these assessments, feeding back information both to the Pentagon and to others in our government so we can make a rational calculation on how to structure and size the force we're talking about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President has directed the National Security Adviser to go meet with Canadian officials and others, most likely in New York tomorrow, to put final touches on a proposed mission. He reserves the right to review that before making any final decisions related to deployment, but again, to summarize, in principle he agrees that U.S. participation in this important humanitarian effort is vital; it reflects our humanitarian concerns about the situation that exists now in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lundazi - President Frederick Chiluba has refuted press reports in the local media saying he has postponed the November 18 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Chiluba said as president of this country he has no constitutional powers to postpone the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on arrival in Lundazi this morning where he will address a public rally this afternoon to drum-up support for his party and its candidates, he said only the electoral commission had the power to postpone the elections should need arise.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I am aware the Zambian people are very anxious to hear about the outcome of my visit to South Africa to meet President Nelson Mandela but all I can say now is that my counter part will speak to some people in this country and we shall see what happens. Those who say I had postponed the elections are telling lies,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He appealed to people in the district with to continue with their election campaign and keep their voters cards safely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Lusaka, Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) also had its General Secretary Derrick Chitala threatening that no one will postpone the November 18 presidential and general elections without consulting the opposition parties entered into the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Chitala said that ZDC has spent about K6 billion on organising for this elections during the past 15 months and would not allow any person, including the President, Mr Chiluba to postpone the elections without consulting them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They welcomed government's reaffirmed statement that elections would be held as arranged on November 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vice President Godfrey Miyanda's said in Lusaka today that the November 18 elections would not be postponed contrary to what local and international media purported because doing so would be contradicting the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Briefing journalists in Lusaka Gen. Miyanda denied that President Chiluba promised South African President Nelson Mandela that the November 18 elections would be postponed to allow electoral and constitutional differences with the opposition political parties to be solve before elections could take place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gen. Miyanda said at no time during the press briefing in South Africa did President Chiluba make such a committment which could seem to undermine the independence of the electoral commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Chitala said not even the president could postpone the elections without first consulting the opposition because a lot of effort and money had already been spent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He appealed to President Chiluba and UNIP president, Dr. Kaunda to resolve what he called personal differences to avoid dragging the country into civil war.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Simwatachela told his subjects that voting would be acknowledging the land act which most people had rejected.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the land act would kill chiefdoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief said this in his closing remarks to a Zambia Civic Education Association (ZCEA) workshop held in Mapatizya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Zambia there are 202 chiefs and 41 chiefs in Southern province. And all the 41 chiefs rejected that act. And for us to vote it will be like us telling them to go ahead with the act. can you imagine a chief having no land?&quot; asked Simwatachela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simwatachela also told his subjects that if it were possible, all those who had voted for the land act should not be given another term in parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier a villager, Wankie Kaliyangile told ZCEA chairperson Lucy Sichone that he was strongly opposed to the land act which vests all land in the President because politicians come and go while chiefs who have administered land on behalf of the people are for life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is what petitioners told us during the Mwanakatwe Constitutional Review Commission. They wanted power to land to be given to the chiefs because they could not trust the politicians,&quot; said Sichone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another villager Chizzuwa Makwembe complained that putting value on land would just put most villagers in a disadvantaged position because they would not manage the process of acquiring certificates of title.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (pana) - The Zambian supreme court Thursday, dismissed as &quot; premature&quot; a petition filed by five opposition parties challenging President Frederick Chiluba's eligibility to run for president in elections planned for the Nov. 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A full supreme court bench of seven judges made the ruling on a preliminary issue raised by the court itself on whether it had powers to hear the petition before the elections, as required by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition parties asked the court to order postponement of the elections and initiate a probe into Chiluba's nationality.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is in line with the new Zambian law which requires that only citizens born in Zambia of Zambian parentage qualify to run for the office of president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition claims that Chiluba and his parents do not meet the criteria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Justice Matthew Ngulube in dismissing the petition, said that it was premature, and ran counter to the provisions of the electoral law, according to which &quot;a petition shall be filed within 14 days after the new president has been sworn-in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four parties filed the petition on Monday. They were later joined by the Zambia Democratic Congress which also said it had doubts about Chiluba's claim to be a bona fide Zambian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The others are the main opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP) , of former President Kenneth Kaunda, the Liberal Progressive Front, the National Congress and the Agenda for Zambia parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court also noted that delaying the right to petition was not denying the right to petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To knock a presidential candidate out of the race would deprive the citizens their right to seek and form the next government since there is no provision to allow for new nominations,&quot; Ngulube said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court, which dismissed the petition with costs, advised the petitioners to file a suit within 14 days after the new president has been sworn-in as the law required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyers for the petitioners had earlier on Thursday argued that the electoral act clearly stated that an aspiring presidential candidate must meet the requisites of the presidential qualifications and must comply before the event and not &quot;subsequent&quot; to the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lead counsel, Edward Shawana, said the electoral act was inconsistent in that it allows a presidential candidate who does not meet all the requirements of the act to contest for presidency as he/she can only be petitioned within 14 days after the new president has been sworn-in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To stop the applicants from filing in a petition at this stage will be denying them their constitutional rights to do so... but are denied under the electoral act,&quot; Shawana said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the government side, the Solicitor-General, Sam Chisulo, said the petition be dismissed because by allowing the petition it will be &quot;impossible&quot; to hold an election since there will always be a multiplicity of petitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another development, one of the lawyers for the petitioners, Mainza Chona, disclosed to the court after the ruling that two of the witnesses they intended to call to challenge Chiluba's citizenship claims received parcel bombs earlier in the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyer said the devices were handed over to the police who defused them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngulube said the matter will be looked into if a fresh petition filed after the elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW RORK, (PANA) - Egypt has formally submitted the candidature of Boutros Boutros-Ghali for re-election as the secretary-general of the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter to the president of the Security Council, Egypt's permanent representative to the U.N., Nabil Elaraby, expressed the hope that the council would reflect &quot;the will of the majority&quot; in its decision on which candidate to recommend to the General Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 185-member assembly elects a secretary-general on the recommendation of the 15-member council.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The candidature of Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali enjoys wide support by the majority of the U.N. membership,&quot; the Egyptian ambassador said in the letter, dated Nov. 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, two major regional organizations, the Organization of African Unity and the League of Arab States, have endorsed H.E. Dr. Boutros Boutros- Ghali for a second full term as secretary-general of the U.N.,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a private lunch in New York on Tuesday to discuss the election procedure, the council agreed that informal consultations on the election would start next Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States has vowed to bar Boutros-Ghali, using its veto if necessary, from a second term on accusations of not pursuing enough reforms at the world body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But other veto-wielding members of the council--China, France, Britain and Russia--support Boutros-Ghali's re-election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the secretary-general, whose current five-year term will expire on Dec. 31, is the only official candidate for the election, other names have been mentioned in recent times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They include the UN under-secretary-general for peace-keeping operations, Kofi Annan, a Ghanaian, the president of the International Peace Academy in New York, Olara Otunnu of Uganda and the secretary-general of the Islamic Conference, Hamid Algabid of Niger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, members of the council have agreed that if the U.S. vetoes Boutros-Ghali as threatened, Africa should be given the chance to produce a list of other candidates for consideration before candidates from other regions are allowed to come in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The understanding is that Africa deserves a second term,&quot; a source close to the council said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ROME, Italy (PANA) - Some 195,000 refugees could die within a month unless there is &quot;massive intervention&quot; in eastern Zaire now, a ranking United Nations official said Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Catherine Bertini, the executive director of the World Food Programme, said in a news conference here that 80,000 children were affected by starvation in the region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Children are particularly at risk especially those who have started breast- feeding,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees are fleeing the ongoing three-way fight between the Zairean army, Rwandan Hutu militia and Zairean Tutsi rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bertini, who is attending the World Food Summit, said a multinational force which is being readied for deployment in eastern Zaire will have to first separate the Hutu militia from the refugees if food delivery is to be immediate and effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her agency has enough food for the 1.2 million refugees who are fleeing northward from Goma, westward from Bukavu and Uvira, and south from Uvira toward Fizi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is, she said, &quot;there is not a clear indication of where they are&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said that two United States aircraft from Entebbe, Uganda flying low to locate the refugees, suspended their operations after being fired on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the agency has a C-130 Hercules military aircraft standing by to begin airdrops as soon as the refugees are located and &quot;as soon as it is safe&quot; to conduct the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency has food prepositioned in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzanian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assistant executive director of the World Food Programme, Jean-Jacques Graisse, told PANA that the agency could make deliveries to Bukuvu and Uvira so long as it gets permission from Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said, many of the agencies vehicles have been stolen by retreating Zairean government troops.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MBABANE, Swaziland (PANA) - Swazi Finance Minister Derek von Wissell resigned Wednesday because he could no longer clean up the mess at a state- owned bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wissel, the first ever cabinet minister to resign, quit 15 hours after a reshuffle Tuesday, that relegated him to the lesser portfolio of tourism and communications.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than accept the new posting, he quit on a matter of principle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only conclusion I can draw from being moved in a new portfolio is that government no longer supports the work I started at SDSB (Swaziland Development and Savings Bank),&quot; he said in press release.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Licari, who was attending a presentation of medical equipment, commended &quot; the great political will&quot; of the Senegalese government in contributing troops to the Canadian-led force.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - Three Egyptian fundamentalists of the opposition Gama'a Al-Islamiya, who were sentenced to death in September for involvement in an abortive attempt on the life of President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa in June 1995, have appealed to the Ethiopian federal supreme court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman of the Addis Ababa central high court, which found the defendants guilty, was quoted by the government press Thursday as saying that the Ethiopian defence lawyer for the convicts had submitted to the court a 13- point deputation appealing its verdict of Sept. 21, 10 days after the sentence was passed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the sentence is upheld by the supreme court, the death penalty will only be carried out after the final approval of President Negasso Gidada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three convicts had been identified earlier as Sofit Hassen Abdul Kabi, Abdul Karim Naddi and Al-Arib Sadik. They had pleaded not guilt to the charges and were tried in camera beginning April 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were found guilty of complicity in the attempted assassination of Mubarak and the killing of two policemen on duty at the time of the incident on June 26, 1995, in which three civilians were also wounded. The trio were also charged on smuggling fire arms, including grenade launchers, through the Sudan Airways office in Addis Ababa, into the country as part of the assassination plot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three convicts were said to be part of an 11-man Egyptian hit squad sponsored by the Gama'a Al-Islamiya, trained in Pakistan. Nine of the men entered Ethiopia with Yemeni, Sudanese and Egyptian passports to assassinate Mubarak as he flew into Addis Ababa from Cairo to attend an OAU summit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA, Uganda (PANA) - Zairean troops backed by Ugandan rebels Wednesday attacked the Ugandan border towns of Mpondwe and Bwera in south western district of Kasese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda's Foreign Affairs Minister, Martin Aliker told an impromptu news conference Wednesday night that a Uganda Peoples' Defence Force platoon at Karambi, seven kilometers (4.4 miles) northwest of Bwera and Mpondwe border posts had been attacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the attackers were a combination of Zairean forces and some Ugandan dissidents trained in Zaire. However, the minister could not name the dissident groups involved in the attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not know the names but we are aware that Ugandan dissidents were involved&quot; Aliker said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the raiders were repulsed and three of them were killed but &quot; shelling has continued sporadically most of the day from the Zairean side&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the attack, Uganda sent heavy reinforcements to the scene from the nearby towns of Mbarara and Fort Portal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eye witness reports from Kasese say that the rebels started shooting at around 7.30 a.m local time before taking the customs post 30 minutes later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scared residents claimed that about 50 people were feared dead including the headmaster of Karambi Secondary School and some of his students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aliker could not explain why Zairean troops had attacked Uganda now when they are embroiled in the Banyamurenge crisis in the east of their country. &quot; We do not know. But I think it is sheer madness for Zaire to attack us from that side. It is a diversionary attack&quot; he stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said that he could not confirm whether the attack was sanctioned by the government of Zaire, or it was a result of general lawlessness that is prevailing in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister said Uganda would not sever diplomatic relations with Zaire because they were not aware that the Zaire government had authorized the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We really sympathize with the government of Zaire because of this Banyamurenge crisis. And we are aware there is no government in eastern Zaire, so we cannot sever the ties before we have proof&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamurenge rebels, ethnic Zairean Tutsi militants, launched attacks in the eastern parts of the country nearly a month ago, with the alleged backing of Rwanda and Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zairean government has accused Uganda, too, of helping the Banyamurenge and parliament in Kinshasa passed a resolution calling for the severance of diplomatic relations with all the three countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - Human Rights Watch today (November 11) calls upon the United Nations Security Council to release the Third Report of the International Commission of Inquiry (Rwanda) concerning arms flows to former Rwandan government forces based in neighboring countries, particularly Zaire, Tanzania and Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such arms trafficking is in violation of an international arms embargo. The report illustrates how members of the international community enlarged the conflict in Central Africa by supplying arms to, or failing to impede the rearming of, the perpetrators of the 1994 genocide. Human Rights Watch believes that the illicit arms trade is a major contributing factor to the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis in Central Africa, and consequently to the serious abuses of human rights and the spiraling civilian toll that this conflict has entailed. &quot;Suppressing this essential report on the role of arms trafficking in Central Africa at exactly the moment when the region is going up in flames suggests that the Security Council is less interested in promoting international security than it is in covering its own failures,&quot; charged Joost Hiltermann, director of the Human Rights Watch Arms Project.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unpublished report, dated October 28 and of which Human Rights Watch obtained a copy, concludes that &quot;arms have continued to flow to the former Rwandan government forces, often from or through South Africa, Angola, Eastern Europe and the former Yugoslavia, and Kinshasa, Zaire.&quot; The report also details military training conducted by Rwandan rebel forces in Zaire, and coordinated fundraising efforts among the Hutu refugee population in camps in Zaire and Tanzania for the purpose of purchasing arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Commission makes several important recommendations to the Security Council: that states producing arms and matriel introduce into their domestic legislation provisions for the prosecution of individuals who violate the international arms embargo; that Zaire prevent, as it had promised it would (in the November 1995 &quot;Cairo Declaration&quot;), armed groups from operating from its territory and to remove &quot;intimidators&quot; from the refugee camps; that the Security Council consider expanding the embargo imposed on the former Rwandan government forces to include a freeze on assets, including bank accounts, of individuals and organizations involved in raising funds to finance the insurgency; and that, if the Security Council decides to impose an arms embargo on Burundi, such an embargo be extended to Burundese insurgents as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To date, the international community has paid inadequate attention to the key role arms have played in emboldening rebels ensconced in refugee camps in Zaire. Despite repeated calls by the Security Council, no concrete steps for the deployment of international military observers at airfields in the region have been taken. Recommendations made by the International Commission in its second report in March 1996 to establish mechanisms in the Great Lakes region to monitor and curb the flow of arms have been neglected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch calls on the United Nations and the international donor community to undertake the following measures:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Publish forthwith the Third Report of the International Commission of Inquiry (Rwanda) and act upon the Commission's conclusions and recommendations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Implement effective controls to enforce the international arms embargo currently in place against the former Rwandan government forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Impose an arms embargo on Burundi, and undertake steps to ensure that the embargo is enforced equally against both the government and rebel forces based in neighboring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Extend the current term of the International Commission of Inquiry for the period of a year and, once an arms embargo has been imposed on Burundi, expand the Commission's mandate to include arms flowing to all sides in the civil war in Burundi.  The Commission's term should be extended further at the end of the one-year period if its investigation and the situation in the region require this. The Security Council should also take concrete measures to ensure that member states of the United Nations cooperate with the International Commission when so requested, and provide the Commission with enhanced powers of inquiry and additional resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Take active steps to deploy forthwith military observers at airfields in eastern Zaire, as well as at airfields and ports in other countries in the region which the International Commission has found to play a role in the trafficking of arms in violation of U.N. arms embargoes, as recommended in Security Council Resolution 997 (1995) and again in Resolution 1053 (1996).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Encourage member states of the United Nations to take legal action against their nationals involved in arms trafficking in violation of U.N.  arms embargoes, even if said individuals are operating in third countries; and, in the absence of appropriate legislation, encourage governments to enact domestic legislation to prosecute such individuals, as recommended by the International Commission of Inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Encourage states in the Great Lakes region to establish a regional arms register as a way of encouraging transparency about the arms trade and as a first step toward curbing the supply of weapons to armed forces engaged in human rights abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Make the unchecked flow of arms into the Great Lakes region a priority, so at to bring about an end to the serious abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law that are taking place.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Calls for a multinational force to intervene in eastern Zaire appear to have been answered, with the appearance of an American advance team of 40 in Entebbe, Uganda. The Security Council, however, has yet to decide on the mandate of a multinational force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada says it will take charge of the multi-national force on the condition that it does not have to disarm or separate out the Interhamwe and former Rwandan forces from the bona fide refugees. The United States government has also refused to accept any mandate of disarmament.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the planned arrival of a force has generally been welcomed, the conditions of the Canadian and US governments regarding the mandate are seen by much of the humanitarian community to undermine calls to tackle the root causes of the problem - namely the presence of the heavily armed Hutu extremist groups, the Interahamwe and the former Rwandan forces in the refugee camps in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Herman Cohen, former senior US government official and diplomat, said in a BBC interview, there had been conflicting opinions regarding the mandate of an international force and that &quot;the humanitarian option won out over the military one&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statements from UN organisations - such as UNHCR - European NGOs, the European Union and Oxfam have all previously focused on the need to seperate &quot; intimidators from bona fide refugees&quot; in order to tackle the present crisis in eastern Zaire and restore regional stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nairobi Summit (November 5), the Security Council (November 10) and the Organisation of African Unity (November 11) also called for &quot;intimidators&quot; to be seperated out. The UNHCR Regional Liaison Representative for Africa said in an address to the OAU (Monday November 11) that it was essential to separate out intimidators from the bona fide refugees, and organise the orderly repatriation of refugees. He said that one issue was clear: &quot;long term and sustainable peace and security cannot be restored in Eastern Zaire and the countries of the Great Lakes as a whole without a rapid and durable solution to the refugee crisis. He said that in order for the repatriation strategy to work &quot;the intimidators, militants and armed militia who, it seems, may have led many of the refugees into the hills and forests surrounding the camps, must once and for all, be separated from those who are genuinely in need of our protection and assistance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his speech to the Organisation of African Unity, OAU Secretary General Dr Salim Ahmed Salim said &quot;no meaningful progress had been made&quot; to return the refugees since 1994, and the problem would continue, and possibly be exacerbated, unless conditions for repatriation were met. He said &quot;we look back and, bearing in mind the current catastrophic situation ... one cannot but lament the failure to act more decisively when the opportunity had presented itself&quot;. He said inaction had allowed the former Rwandan Army and the Interahamwe to continue holding refugees hostage, leading to killings and counter-killings and the escalation of tension between Zaire and Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rakiya Omaar, co-director of London-based human rights organisation African Rights, told IRIN from Kigali she believed most of the fighting in eastern Zaire is now between the former Rwandan troops or Interahamwe militia and Zairean rebel Alliance for the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo- Zaire (ADFL). Coming from Bukavu and Uvira, she said the planned multinational military intervention was going to be &quot;a thousand times worse than Somalia&quot;. International military intervention is Somalia was widely regarded as a failure. Omaar told IRIN that the &quot;inevitable consequence&quot; of a multinational intervention that refused to disarm armed elements would be violence, and a continuation of the problem - &quot;if you are not going to disarm the armed elements, there is absolutely no purpose of coming. If a multinational force comes, it needs military and political preparation for armed engagment.&quot; She said that there was also a practical problem of separation, because it depended on a notion that there were two distinct groups, whereas the armed element were &quot;husbands, sons, brother-in-laws and children&quot; of the refugee mass. According to Omaar, there were immediate problems of hunger in Bukavu amongst the local population, where economic activity had been reduced to almost nothing. African Rights has said that the idea of a million people dying within weeks was absurd, and say the problem is one of &quot;guns, grenades and genocidal ideologies, not starvation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the announcement of the intentions of the multinational force, many members of the humanitarian community have expressed concern and scepticism about the mission. Some NGOs are expected to issue statements shortly. An editorial in the New York Times yesterday said &quot;it would be reckless to throw a modest-sized international force between two larger warring armies that have yet to negotiate a cease-fire and that violently disagree about about where these refugees should be fed and settled&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US President Bill Clinton did not publicly respond to calls for the US to back a multinational force until Wednesday, after the Canadian government had said it would take command. US presidential elections on November 5th put the eastern Zaire issue &quot;on hold&quot;, and meant that US diplomatic participation on the issue came late. Yesterday White House spokesman said arrangements for military deployment were &quot;moving pretty quickly&quot; because of the &quot;urgency&quot; of the situation, reported AFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States says it is ready to provide more aid to refugees in eastern Zaire once &quot;mechanisms&quot; have been set up to enable it to be delivered, US Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said in Rome yesterday. He said the US had already provided a major share of the humanitarian assistance to the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In London, government ministers and defence officials discussed on Wednesday British participation in a possible multinational intervention force to assist relief efforts. A multinational team is due in Kigali today to discuss modalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The force, according to the Canadian government, is expected to be between 10,000 and 15,000 - much larger than the orignal 5,000 troops proposed by France and Spain. Botswana, South Africa, Cameroon, Chad, Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Mali and Senegal have offered to contribute, and possibly Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - The humanitarian impact of the turmoil in eastern Zaire continues to spill over into Burundi. There has been a marked increase in both the number and size of skirmishes between Hutu rebels and Burundian military authorities as rebels continue to attempt to traverse the country and establish new bases of operation in existing camps in Tanzania on the border with Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past week, fighting or major attacks have been reported in northern, southern and central provinces as well as in the hills overlooking Bujumbura. These attacks have displaced thousands of more people from both major ethnic groups who will require assistance from international humanitarian agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, returnees from the former refugee camps near Uvira continue to arrive at the Gatumba transit camp 15 km west of Bujumbura. However, far fewer have returned than in previous weeks and relief workers have expressed concern about the fate of some 100,000 Burundian refugees missing since fleeing their camps in eastern Zaire last month. Roughly 140,000 of the 220, 000 refugees who fled the Uvira camps were Burundian Hutus. Only 40,000 of them have been accounted for.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. General</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International concern over the three-year old crisis in Burundi has largely been brushed aside by the more dramatic events unfolding in Zaire. However, there are fears among the humanitarian community in Burundi that both sides of the conflict may take advantage of the situation and mount new offensives, leading to a further deterioration of general security and increased humanitarian needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Third Arusha Regional Summit on Oct. 14 said that all parties to the conflict in Burundi should begin negotiations within a month. That deadline has now passed without any evidence of concrete results. Summit participants threatened to take unspecified further actions against Burundi if the deadline was not met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Burundian government has once again claimed that continued attempts by neighboring countries to keep Burundi isolated will be counter productive. A new meeting of regional countries to review economic sanctions imposed on Burundi is scheduled to take place November 14 in Arusha. A spokesman for Buyoya told reporters that it was &quot;unfortunate&quot; that the Burundian government had not even been notified that the meeting would take place, and added that it would serve little purpose unless Burundian government representatives were invited to take part. The meeting had originally been scheduled for November 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the regional implications of the Kivu crisis, Burundian government officials have not been invited to official meetings to discuss actions needed to address the situation in eastern Zaire. Spokesmen for Buyoya have told reporters that his government would support possible international military intervention into eastern Zaire if it was for purely humanitarian purposes, but would reserve further comment until additional details were known.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 11, Hutu rebels attempted to assassinate the governors of Cankuzo and Ruyigi. The attempt was unsuccessful, and neither governor was hurt. The governors, who were travelling in the same vehicle with military escort, were ambushed on RN 13 near the town of Makebuko, 30 km south of Gitega. Casualties suffered by either the attackers or the soldiers guarding the convoy are unclear. This attack against high level Burundian officials was the latest since the governor of Cibitoke was assassinated three weeks ago. Heavy fighting is now reported in Ruyigi province in a front that stretches between the towns of Makebuko and Butaganzwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting between the military and rebels has been reported in southern and western communes in Kayanza province. Hundreds of houses and public buildings have been destroyed. There are as yet no reliable reports on the number of additional people displaced by the fighting. However, there were already over 13,000 people displaced in the province in early October. WFP reports that 8, 000 to 10,000 people are now dispersed in Matongo commune alone, while others have joined existing IDP camps that are guarded by the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 7, Hutu rebels attacked an IDP camp in Matongo commune in Kayanza. Thirty two of the camps residents were killed and 19 injured. On the same day, the nearby village of Kwizamu was destroyed, forcing the residents to flee to the town of Banga now thought to hold 1,500 affected people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skirmishes between the military and rebel forces were also reported just outside of Bujumbura, displacing an additional 10,000 people. Insecurity was reported in the communes of Mugamba, Muhuta, Mukike and Buyengero with at least 300 houses burned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skirmishes were also reported in southern Gitega and Muramvya. Rebels attacked the Gitega commune of Makebuko on November 11 but the number casualties is still unknown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CRS reports that insecurity has forced it to temporarily suspend all activities in the diocese of Gitega. The diocese includes all of Gitega province and parts of Muramvya and Karuzi provinces. CRS is the largest distributor of food and non-food items in Gitega, distributing an average of 100 mt of WFP-donated food to 12,000 beneficiaries per month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 4, the Burundian military reported that one of its soldiers was injured when he stepped on a land mine between Gatumba and the Zairean border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Affected Populations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Uvira now calm and firmly in ADFL hands, aid agencies operating in Burundi are negotiating with Burundian and ADFL authorities to cross the border and enter the town. DHA in Bujumbura is attempting to facilitate access by international humanitarian agencies. Although agencies have now been able to perform rapid needs assessments in Goma and Bukavu, ADFL forces have not permitted aid agencies to travel further south. Zairean government authorities have threatened to withdraw the rights of foreign aid organizations to work in Zaire if they struck deals with the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been almost one month since most of the refugees who were in the Uvira camps have received WFP-distributed food. Many are now dispersed in the hills and high plateau to the west of the town. Others have returned to Uvira and report that food and clean water are scare in the town. Significant levels of malnutrition have been reported among those who have returned to Burundi and registered at the Gatumba transit site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of November 11, 12,774 Burundian returnees had registered at the camp since it opened on October 29. Of those returnees, 10,616 have been transferred to their communes of origin, leaving 2,158 returnees remaining in the camp. The number of new arrivals at the camp has slowed considerably since last week. Although UNHCR registered 578 new returnees on November 7 and 369 new returnees on November 10, on most days fewer than 20 new returnees have arrived. During the first week the camp was open, between 2, 000 and 3,000 people were registered per day. With up to 100,000 Burundians remaining on the other side of the border, it is unclear if Burundian refugees are being prevented from returning or if they are refusing to return out of fear for their own security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.Humanitarian Coordination</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 8 representatives from UNHCR, WFP, FAO, IFRC and MSF-Belgium travelled in an armored UN vehicle, with heavy military escort, to Buganda in Cibitoke province. This was the first visit to the province by international humanitarian agencies since the assassination of three ICRC staff members visiting the province in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of former Burundian refugees from the camps in South Kivu returned directly to Cibitoke without passing through the Gatumba transit site. Between 12,000 and 16,000 of them are believed to be living in fields near Buganda, 10 km south of Cibitoke town. They are now being registered by local authorities. With only the limited possessions they were able to carry with them from Zaire, few have shelter or other basic living supplies. There is no clean water or sanitation facilities and the risk of disease is high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP and UNHCR are in the process of arranging distributions of food and non- food relief items to the site to begin soon. Periodic follow up visits to the site by humanitarian agencies are also planned. In a November 12 meeting hosted by UNHCR, the Burundian government welcomed on-going efforts to provide relief to returnees in Cibitoke, and asked humanitarian organizations to consider implementing broader and more permanent programs for affected populations in the province. Given security concerns, no international organization has yet agreed to do so.  Three thousand Burundians from Mugina commune in Cibitoke, who had been living in refugee camps in South Kivu, are now encamped in a football stadium in Rugombo, 10 km north of Cibitoke. They have returned to Burundi, via Gatumba, over the last two weeks and have been transferred to the Rugombo site by the Burundian government with the cooperation of UNHCR. Continued insecurity in Mugina has prevented their transfer to their home commune. Although WFP and UNHCR provided the returnees with three months worth of food, jerry cans, soap, sheeting and other basic relief items, they have no access to clean water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the endemic insecurity in the province, On November 9 MSF issued a statement criticizing efforts by the Burundian government and UNHCR to repatriate returnees to Cibitoke. The statement added that many of the returnees were malnourished or ill and continued repatriation of returnees to the region would make it difficult for humanitarian organizations to ensure the returnees well being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CRS reports that it conducted two distributions in Bubanza through its local church partners. Over a thousand residents of a displaced camp in Nabubu commune were provided with food and non-food relief items. Local diocese workers also distributed food in Bubanza hospital to 215 patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A special UNICEF charter flight arrived November 7 from Nairobi with 330, 000 doses of polio vaccine and 440,000 doses of BCG vaccine. The vaccines have been transferred to the Ministry of Health for dispatch to rural health centers. UNICEF says that combined with current stocks, it now has sufficient supplies of BCG and polio vaccine to last four to six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IMC reports that it received a month supply of essential drugs for a total of 20,000 consultations at twelve health centers in Rutana and nine in Muyinga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNICEF reports that it has supplied ACF with 15 mt of food supplements to be used in supplementary feeding programs in health centers in Kayanza and rural Bujumbura.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Impact of Sanctions on Humanitarian Operations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although humanitarian agencies were granted the right to import fuel in early September, agencies have still not received new supplies. Fuel imported from Rwanda has been in Bujumbura for several weeks, but bureaucratic delays have prevented its release from BP(Fina. Following a decision by the RSCC, all further imports will be done through Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports indicate that bakeries are running out of flour with bread shortages now common in the city.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Fierce fighting broke out around Goma overnight and continued today, raising fears that relief efforts would be further hampered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebels opened up with heavy arms and anti-aircraft fire against positions west of the town, targeting a plane which may have also overflown Goma yesterday. The plane then left the area. A BBC reporter in the area said it was the worst violence since the rebels took the town. Some reports said shells were also fired from Mugunga camp near Goma. UNHCR spokesman Peter Kessler said the Interahamwe militia were ordering refugees to gather at Mugunga, in an attempt to prevent their return to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However UNHCR reported that 730 refugees -- probably from the Katale/Kahindo camps -- had defied the Interahamwe and crossed at Mutovu into Rwanda on Wednesday, the biggest number of returnees into Rwanda since fighting broke out last month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of residents started returning home to Goma today. A journalist in Goma said that people arriving in the town from the west say that Mugunga camp is &quot;well hemmed in&quot; by rebel forces. The journalists told IRIN that an elite force was stationed on the west side, seemingly consisting of Rwandan soldiers. Eyewitnesses coming into the town are reporting that the view from the slopes of Nyaragongo shows life &quot;looking normal&quot; inside the camp, with many refugees still there. Some trade is begining again in Goma town, but there is no main crop to depend on because the expected bean crop has not yet come through. Refugees coming into Goma are described as in reasonably good shape, though with blistered and torn feet. One journalist told IRIN that rebel authorities would broadcast that refugees were arriving, presumably to try and reduce tension between the local population and the refugees. The reporter added that tens of thousands of refugees are reported to be making their way from Kahindo and Katale camps, skirting the lava fields, down towards Goma town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a Reuters report today, 800-1,000 internally displaced people arrived in Goma by boat across Lake Kivu from Sake to the northwest. They reported cases of cholera, as well as fighting between Zairean Mai-Mai militia, ex-FAR troops, the Interahamwe and rebels. A BBC reporter said the Zaireans, who came with a few belongings, had spoken of appalling conditions and heavy clashes in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFP reported that Tutsi rebels turned away a delegation from Medecins sans Frontieres attempting to enter Bukavu from Rwanda. It said aid agencies had made no headway with rebels in the South Kivu area of which Bukavu is the capital. NGO reports from Bukavu described the situation as &quot;worrying&quot; with a possible epidemic of diarrhoea, particularly among small children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A UN relief flight funded by Switzerland arrived in Kinshasa today, using an AN-124 aircraft supplied by Emercom (Russia) to bring 100 MT of UNICEF supplies from Copenhagen, including 10,000 blankets, medical supplies and 31 tonnes of milk and high energy biscuits. The flight was arranged by DHA's Military and Civil Defence Unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire lashed out at the world community today, accusing it of indifference and saying any aid should be delivered to the refugees' home countries. &quot;The refugees who live today in the east of Zaire belong to states run by governments which cannot with any excuse, duck their responsibility to accept their compatriots inside their borders,&quot; deputy premier Mutombo Bakafwa Nsenda told an FAO summit in Rome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mobutu was due to meet an OAU delegation today in the southern French town of Roquebrune-Cap Martin where he is recovering from cancer surgery. The delegation is led by Kenyan foreign minister Kalonzo Musyoka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NGOs today continued to press for disarming Hutu militias and ex-FAR troops.  Oxfam said the proposed multinational force must have a mandate to carry this out. &quot;The lessons of the last two years have been that humanitarian aid is no substitute for political action,&quot; it said. MSF said it was &quot; disappointed&quot; that the force was not intended to &quot;separate the criminals&quot; and unless this happened, it was difficult to see how the refugees could be repatriated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CNN said in a report today that aid agencies in Rwanda felt the challenge to a multinational force was to separate genuine refugees from the armed Hutu militia and former Rwandan forces. CNN's Christiane Amanpour said aid agencies were concerned that massive quantities of aid were not the solution, but that the international community should try and &quot;break the lock&quot; and stop the armed groups holding the refugees hostage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila today warned of a Somali-like situation in eastern Zaire if the multinational force was &quot;ill-intentioned&quot; or sought to &quot;Balkanize the country&quot;. He also told reporters in Goma that use of the local airport was &quot;negotiable&quot;, but that foreign soldiers could use airports in Rwanda and Uganda instead. Meanwhile, reports from Zaire near the Rwandan border town of Gisenyi said the rebels had set up an FM radio station called Radio Star.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada has called on countries interested in contributing troops to the multinational force to meet in New York later today to discuss a &quot;plan of action&quot;. A foreign ministry statement said participants would include Britain, France, the USA and &quot;key aid donors&quot;. An advance team of 24 Canadian armed forces personnel, meanwhile, would head for the region today and another 250- strong military team, including doctors, engineers and communications specialists, was on standby. The US sent a team to Kigali today for discussions. The UN Security Council was expected to approve the mandate and deployment of the force by Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said today the force could be ready for deployment by the weekend, while his spokesman Yves Doutriaux said a European should be among three deputy commanders of the force. He added that France would &quot;secure the airport at Bukavu&quot;. Senior government sources in Britain indicated it would send between 2,000 and 4,000 troops to eastern Zaire. Defence Secretary Michael Portillo speaking on the BBC today made no mention of numbers, but said the operation should quickly be handed over to African forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a US airborne infantry battalion prepared to fly into eastern Zaire next week, two US relief teams were prevented from entering the region, according to a State Department statement on Wednesday. Zairean rebels in Goma told a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) to return to Rwanda minutes after it had arrived, and a second group was turned back from Bukavu. A third team of military and civilian officials meanwhile, led by US coordinator for Rwanda and Burundi Richard Bogosian, was in Uganda en route for Rwanda and eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US contingent of the Canadian-led intervention force would comprise some 1,000 troops to be deployed in the Goma area and up to another 3,000 would support the operation in other countries, according to US officials quoted by AFP. The troops, who would be in Zaire for about four months, would be equipped to defend themselves under &quot;robust&quot; rules of engagement similar to the US operation in Bosnia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP said its current stock level in the eastern Zaire region amounted to 71, 358 mt, enough to feed 1.5 million people (including 1.25 million refugees and 250,000 affected Zaireans) for about 50 days. As another potential refugee crisis unfolded in Burundi, the UN indicated supplies there were running low. There were 63 days' worth of emergency food rations left, enough for 250,000 beneficiaries. Burundi's prime minister told WFP executive director Ms Bertini on Tuesday that his country had given clearance for international organisations to enter eastern Zaire from Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN special envoy Raymond Chretien was due in Burundi tomorrow, a UN source said, and Humanitarian Coordinator Sergio Vieira de Mello was due in Kigali today. The Deputy Humanitarian Coordinator, Martin Griffiths, is in Kampala this evening en route to Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three armed raiders were killed by Ugandan troops in the Kasese area on the border with Zaire Wednesday, a Ugandan official said. Martin Aliker, Minister of State for foreign affairs, told a news conference they were members of gang made up of Zairean soldiers and Ugandan dissidents which had attacked a Ugandan military installation near the border earlier this week. He said the attackers were driven back into Zaire, adding he was unsure whether the attack had been sanctioned by Kinshasa or at a local level. WFP described the situation around Kasese as tense following the attack which reportedly involved 200 Zairean troops and Ugandan dissidents. It said several thousand Ugandans were displaced as a result of the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australia today announced a financial aid package of 2.6 million Australian dollars for the refugee crisis in Zaire, 100,000 of which will go to DHA IRIN.  Other contributors to DHA IRIN since its inception in October 1995 are Sweden, Norway, UK, USA, Belgium, Netherlands and Israel.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Zambia today turned down a suggestion from South African President, Nelson Mandela, that the presidential and parliamentary elections due in the country on Monday be postponed so as to accomodate opposition United National Independence Party of Kenneth Kaunda - which opted to boycott the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Electoral Commission chairman, Justice Bobby Bwalya, told reporters in Lusaka today that he had told President Mandela's emissary, Justice Richard Goldstone, that there was no law in Zambia now that would allow the postponment of the November 18 general elections unless Zambia had a state of emergency in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even then, he explained, the postponement could only be made at the prerogative of the republican President.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think we should not have a state of emergency. As a commission we feel the political situation does not warrant a state of emergency,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He revealed that South African President Mandela had assigned Justice Goldstone, a member of the Constitutional Court of South Africa to meet Justice Bwalya - as the chairperson of the Zambian Electoral Commission to find a way upon which the elections could be postponed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He found that there was no such law allowing the postponement and Justice Goldstone promised to report back to President Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Bwalya said many political parties have already spent a lot of money in preparing for the elections and it would be unfair to postpone the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission, he said, has already put in place all necessary arrangements to ensure the success of the elections and assured all political parties participating in the elections that all materials needed in the exercise have already been delivered to provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year's general elections are the most heavily contested ever in the history of the country adding that there are five presidential candidates, 11 political parties with a total number of 606 parliamentary candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three candidates have been returned unopposed on the MMD ticket in Pambashe, Luapula and Sikongo constituences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eleven political parties are Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD) fielding 150 candidates, Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) 142, National Party (NP) 99, National Lima Party (NLP) 83, Agenda for Zambia 11, National Congress 4, United National Independence Party (UNIP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others are Movement for Democratic Process(MDP), two, Liberal Progressive Front (LPF), one, Real Democracy Party(RDP), one, Party for Poor People (PPP) one; and Independents, 96.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the grabbed voters cards will in no way affect the elections because they are only 15,000 compared to a total of 2.2 million registered voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voting will commence at 06.00 hours to 17.00 hours and counting will be done at polling stations while results will be submitted to the electoral commission in Lusaka by electoral officers immediately after they are certified correct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warned people intending to disrupt the elections that the law will take its course and culprits brought to book.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Zambia Association of Manufacturers (ZAM) and the state owned Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO) are approaching agreement on reducing the 50 per cent penalty charge imposed on industrial producers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have had fruitful discussions with ZESCO and they have agreed to look at the manufacturing sector again.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">I must say that they have been very co- operative. The surcharge cannot go on at the present rate,&quot; said ZAM chairman Mark O'Donnell in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Donnell had earlier appealed to the government to reorganise the energy sector and assess its impact on Zambian industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Donnell said last month that about 40 big energy users in the manufacturing industry were in danger of closing operations if ZESCO persisted in imposing the 50 per cent surcharge on industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our focus is to come up with some penalty which is more agreeable to both parties,&quot; said O'Donnell.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Some members of the FAZ interim committee have been named in a plot that culminated in yesterday's sacking of national team trainer, Roald Poulsen, Post investigations have revealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sports ministry permanent secretary, Arthur Yoyo, announced in a press statement yesterday that &quot;time has come for Mr Poulsen to return home to Denmark and pursue other professional career avenues&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My ministry therefore has agreed to release the coach following the expiry of his contract at the end of October, 1996,&quot; Yoyo said, adding: &quot;This stand has been taken with due consideration to the tasks that lie ahead for the Zambia national team, in both the Africa and World Cup engagements.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But according to the investigations, the &quot;gang&quot; which includes interim chairman Michael Chiti, treasurer Musa Kasonka Jr and technical sub-committee chairman Whiteson Chiti had been working round the clock to have Poulsen fired and last week Wednesday, they met at the National Provident Fund (NPF) sports club in Lusaka where they decided to replace the Dane with Profund Warriors coach Boniface Simutowe, Coaches Association of Zambia vice-chairman Lewis Shambulo, former Power Dynamos coach Jericho Shinde and either Botswana Meat Corporation football club coach Dick Chama or former national team coach Samuel &quot;Zoom&quot; Ndhlovu as head coach.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simutowe and some FAZ officials were expected to travel to Botswana on Tuesday to talk to Chama and Ndhlovu over the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigations further revealed that another trip is planned for Zimbabwe to talk to Jones Chilengi and Webster Chikabala and another to Swaziland to cajole Michael Musonda and Jani Simulambo should the Twsana- based coaches refuse to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But both Chiti and Kasonka Jr denied in separate interviews yesterday that there was no such a plot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How can I plot to remove Poulsen when I have just written to the government to renew Poulsen's contract,&quot; argued Chiti.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They however admitted that they were at the NPF club on Wednesday but denied that they had gone there to plot against Poulsen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, we went to the NPF club on Wednesday and yes, I talked to both Simutowe and Shambulo. But my being seen with them does not mean that we were plotting against Poulsen,&quot; Chiti said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kasonka Jr added: &quot;It's a total fabrication. To say just because we were there then we were plotting to remove Poulsen is unfair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a source at Anchor House disclosed in an interview yesterday that the item of discussion was Poulsen's fate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They spent the whole night plotting to replace Poulsen with Simutowe, Shambulo, and Shinde&quot; the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the source, Poulsen could have been fired before the match between Congo and Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the meeting Simutowe who had already been tipped for the job had been following the training of the national team at the BP Sports Club in anticipation of him taking over as coach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, on the day the national team left for Sudan, Simutowe and Shambulo arrived at the Lusaka International Airport as early as 07:00 hours with packed bags and ready to lead the 19-man squad to the World Cup first leg encounter in Pointe Noire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiti did not deny this fact and disclosed that Poulsen had actually asked him about the presence of the duo at the airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Poulsen asked me why Simutowe and Shambulo were at the airport,&quot; Chiti confessed. &quot;I told him they were probably there to see the team off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the source disclosed that Poulsen was aware of the plot and that is why he arrived at the airport wearing a suit instead of the usual track suit.  Poulsen was anticipating FAZ would drop him on the last minute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making the donation in Lusaka yesterday, Italian Ambassador to Zambia, Margherita Costa, said Zambia can eradicate Cholera if she is committed to a consistent community awareness campaign on basic hygiene.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Receiving the donation, deputy permanent secretary for the Ministry of Health, Dr Kashiwa Bulaya, said the donation was timely as the country was approaching the rainy season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is basically the rainy season when Cholera invades most of our people in the rural areas,&quot; Bulaya said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also noted that cholera was a preventable disease if people were well educated on conditions of hygiene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And epidemiologist at the Ministry of Health, Dr Roy Chimba, in an interview yesterday, assured that the recent outbreak of cholera in Lusaka was under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A cholera outbreak recently ravaged Lusaka in which more than twenty-four were reportedly admitted at the Cholera centre where a few deaths were also recorded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outbreak was attributed to shortage of water in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - President Frederick Chiluba and the Electoral Commission have contradicted each other on who, between them, has the powers to postpone the disputed elections scheduled for November 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President on his last leg of the campaign meetings in Eastern Province yesterday told a campaign rally in Lundazi that he had &quot;no powers under the Constitution to postpone an election&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Chiluba said only the Electoral Commission had powers to postpone the elections under the electoral provisions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President's remarks come amid wide speculation that the elections were going to be postponed following a consultative meeting he held with the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) chairman, South African President Nelson Mandela, on how best to resolve the country's political impasse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a joint press conference with President Mandela in Pretoria on Tuesday, President Chiluba indicated that the polls would go ahead but left the door open for possible postponement, saying:&quot;For now I would say 'yes'(they will go ahead on schedule) but let's see if we can consult.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Vice-President Godfrey Miyanda, at a press briefing in Lusaka yesterday, said there was no justification for the elections to be put off. He said a lot of money had already been spent on preparations for the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Electoral Commission yesterday, however, maintained it had no powers to postpone the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have no powers under the Electoral Act or under the Constitution to postpone elections. The only person who can do so is only the President and only when there is a state of emergency, that is when there is a war or the situation is not conducive or the whole nation is, torn to pieces,&quot; vice- chairman of the Electoral Commission, Mebeelo Kalima, told participants at a meeting organised by Rainbow Monitors yesterday at Lusaka's Holiday Inn Garden Court Hotel . &quot;There is none at the moment and so the elections are going ahead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Lusaka lawyer Sakwiba Sikota, in an interview yesterday, said the prevailing political situation in the country clearly indicated a crisis hence President Chiluba's trip to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A state of emergency is not only where there is visible armed insurrection.  It could also be in a situation where there are widespread floods or other natural calamities,&quot; Sikota said, adding: &quot;In the current Constitutional impasse of such proportions, a state of emergency would not be misplaced.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But vice-chairman of the Legal Resource Foundation(LRF) and Lusaka lawyer John Sangwa charged that the government was only playing games over the issue.  He said the issue of elections was a political one within the President's jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a political question where the President can postpone the elections. If there is no legal framework to allow him to do that what can stop him from creating one when he is the one who announced the date of elections?&quot; Sangwa asked in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Law Association of Zambia (LAZ) chairman, George Kunda, said the independent Electoral Commission has powers vested in them to postpone elections if Parliament is dissolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The commission can postpone the elections provided that they are the ones who issued the initial statutory order prescribing November 18 as the election date,&quot; Kunda said in a telephone interview from Ndola yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Police spokesman Francis Musonda is insisting that people collecting voters cards are committing an offence despite opnions by various lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We once again wish to reiterate as a police service that requesting people to surrender their voters cards is an offence under Act No 2 of 1991,&quot; Musonda said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Musonda's statement comes in the wake of several legal opinions that it is not an offence for anyone to surrender a voter's card because such a card was being given out of one's free will. But Musonda referred to regulations 61(b) and 62 of the electoral (registration of voters) act which he said provide that &quot;it is an offence to be in possession of another person's voter's card or to ask or require another person to surrender his or her voter's card given to such other person in pursuance of the regulations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Police spokesman added: &quot;Any person who is guilty of an offence against these regulations shall be liable on conviction to a fine or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding one year or both such fine and such imprisonment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But UNIP has defied police warnings against collecting of voters cards from people and has continue with the exercise. UNIP secretary general Sebastian Zulu said people were surrendering the cards out of their own free will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanshile Musonda has denied allegations by the opposition that some senior police officers are being partisan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These people (opposition) allege that the police are being partisan and yet part of our civic responsibility is to educate the Zambian society on their rights,&quot; Musonda said yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Bank of Zambia (BOZ) faces collapse unless the foreign judgment against it is set aside by the Lusaka High Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a judgement passed in the English courts, Bank of Zambia has been ordered to pay Camdex US$120 million for non service of a debt advanced to the bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judgment against the Bank of Zambia by the English court was finally registered in the High Court of Zambia on October 8, by Shamwana and Company in which the Bahamas based Camdex is claiming its US$120 million pay back.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the Bank is pleading with the Lusaka High Court that it sets aside this judgement because implementing it would totally bankrupt the Central Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bank of Zambia has found itself in the mess after it sold to Camdex the debt it has owed the Central Bank of Kuwait since 1988. The debt was expected to mature in May, 1989 but the Zambian Central bank failed to honour it forcing Camdex to service it on their behalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of an agreement for assignment between Camdex and the central bank of Kuwait, the debt was pegged at US$68,637,772.036 but has now increased to more than US$120m. This is the money Camdex is now battling to get off Bank of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an affidavit filed on October 18 in the Lusaka High Court by acting deputy bank governor Situmbeko Musokotwane under case number 1996/HP/4107 the bank argues that Camdex bought the debt knowing the conditions for the debt buy-back and that under the Paris Club arrangement, the central bank cannot treat Camdex differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the strength of the foregoing I respectfully submit that an enforcement of the judgment against BOZ will be contrary to public policy in the Republic.  It is in the national interest that registration of the foreign judgment by Camdex be set aside,&quot; Musokotwane says in his affidavit opposing the registration of an English court judgment in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He adds: &quot;the alternative should this court be minded to find for the plaintiff, then the defendant prays that settlement should be consistent with either the Paris Club or debt buy back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bank is pleading that bailiffs should not be sent to the Central Bank as this would cripple their operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And during the hearing in England BOZ through lawyers Lovell White Durant fought the court ruling in favour of Camdex who were represented by Baker Mackenzie but the Court of Appeal dismissed the case on April 4, 1996.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Some Supreme Court judges yesterday differed with the lawyers of the opposition parties petitioning President Frederick Chiluba's nomination in next Monday's presidential elections on what constitutes &quot;a full bench&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four of the five judges defined a full bench as a sitting by any uneven number of Supreme Court judges but the petitioners, lawyers argued that it is a sitting of the highest uneven number of all serving Supreme Court judges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Chief Justice, Bonaventure Bweupe, justices Weston Muzyamba and Matthew Chaila argued that it was in order for five judges to hear the petition and the injunction because they constituted a full bench and this was in line with what they (judges and lawyers) had earlier agreed upon in the chambers the previous day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the lawyers for the petitioners led by state counsel Edward Shamwana, Professor Patrick Mvunga, Sakwiba Sikota and Ostoph Dzekedzeke refused to accept the court's definition, insisting that a full bench according to the Constitution meant all the judges of the Supreme Court.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My submission is that a full bench should mean all the judges of the Supreme Court and not what appears to have been accepted as five,&quot; Shamwana said after justices Bweupe, Chaila, Muzyamba, David Lewanika and Dennis Chirwa walked into the court room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Bweupe asked Shamwana whether a full bench did not in fact mean an uneven number of either 3, 5, 7 or 9 to which Shamwana vehemently refused insisting that the law was clear on the composition of a full bench and that there was no theory about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shamwana referred the judges to Article 92 (5) and Article 41 of the Constitution which makes reference to a specific requirement of the full bench of the Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not a theoretical matter, it is a fact. The Supreme Court consists of 9 judges. We are talking about a full bench which now is 7. Article 42 is quite clear,&quot; Shamwana said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five judges were supposed to hear two petitions by four oppositions parties on President Frederick Chiluba's nomination as presidential candidate and an injunction to restrain the November 18 elections from taking place before the court hears the petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bweupe observed that going by petitioners definition the full bench at the moment could only be 7 because two (to make 9) had not yet been appointed and asked what would happen if one of the 7 recused himself and another was sick.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Solicitor General, Sam Chisulo, representing the Attorney General and the Elections Commission, said the arguments being presented in court yesterday had been presented on Tuesday before Justice Bweupe in chambers. He said they (State) had asked for a full bench and the petitioners asked for 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then Justice Bweupe said there had been a suggestion in chambers that the deputy chief justice should recuse himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact it was made known to me that the other side would be comfortable if the chief justice sat on the matter,&quot; Chisulo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Bweupe said: &quot;Perhaps I wrongly excluded the Chief Justice but I was of the view that having been the returning officer, he would not sit in this matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sikota clarified that the position of the defence was that all the judges of the Supreme Court should sit without making specific preference to any particular judge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bweupe,however, asked whether the Chief Justice, Matthew Ngulube who had been the returning officer could hear the case, to which Shamwana said the job he had performed was a clerical function that could have no effect on this hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another lawyer for the petitioners, Dzekedzeke, said the purpose of asking for seven judges is to emphasise the gravity of the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I cannot visualise a situation where it can be impossible to recall a judge who is on leave,&quot; Dzekedzeke said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Muzyamba then said they had no difficulties in adjourning the matter to another day whilst justice Chaila cynically added: &quot;even to next year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shamwana maintained that it had been made abundantly clear that this is a national issue and what he had requested was what the law said and he submitted that it must be followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a 30 minute adjournment, the five judges conceded to the definition of the petitioners' lawyers and adjourned the case to today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For this reason we adjourn the matter to tomorrow (today) at 09:00 hours so that I can be able to recall those who are on leave,&quot; Justice Bweupe said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (pana) - The Zambian supreme court Thursday, dismissed as &quot; premature&quot; a petition filed by five opposition parties challenging President Frederick Chiluba's eligibility to run for president in elections planned for the Nov. 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A full supreme court bench of seven judges made the ruling on a preliminary issue raised by the court itself on whether it had powers to hear the petition before the elections, as required by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition parties asked the court to order postponement of the elections and initiate a probe into Chiluba's nationality.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is in line with the new Zambian law which requires that only citizens born in Zambia of Zambian parentage qualify to run for the office of president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition claims that Chiluba and his parents do not meet the criteria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Justice Matthew Ngulube in dismissing the petition, said that it was premature, and ran counter to the provisions of the electoral law, according to which &quot;a petition shall be filed within 14 days after the new president has been sworn-in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four parties filed the petition on Monday. They were later joined by the Zambia Democratic Congress which also said it had doubts about Chiluba's claim to be a bona fide Zambian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The others are the main opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP) , of former President Kenneth Kaunda, the Liberal Progressive Front, the National Congress and the Agenda for Zambia parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court also noted that delaying the right to petition was not denying the right to petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To knock a presidential candidate out of the race would deprive the citizens their right to seek and form the next government since there is no provision to allow for new nominations,&quot; Ngulube said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court, which dismissed the petition with costs, advised the petitioners to file a suit within 14 days after the new president has been sworn-in as the law required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyers for the petitioners had earlier on Thursday argued that the electoral act clearly stated that an aspiring presidential candidate must meet the requisites of the presidential qualifications and must comply before the event and not &quot;subsequent&quot; to the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lead counsel, Edward Shawana, said the electoral act was inconsistent in that it allows a presidential candidate who does not meet all the requirements of the act to contest for presidency as he/she can only be petitioned within 14 days after the new president has been sworn-in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To stop the applicants from filing in a petition at this stage will be denying them their constitutional rights to do so... but are denied under the electoral act,&quot; Shawana said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the government side, the Solicitor-General, Sam Chisulo, said the petition be dismissed because by allowing the petition it will be &quot;impossible&quot; to hold an election since there will always be a multiplicity of petitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another development, one of the lawyers for the petitioners, Mainza Chona, disclosed to the court after the ruling that two of the witnesses they intended to call to challenge Chiluba's citizenship claims received parcel bombs earlier in the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyer said the devices were handed over to the police who defused them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngulube said the matter will be looked into if a fresh petition filed after the elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW RORK, (PANA) - Egypt has formally submitted the candidature of Boutros Boutros-Ghali for re-election as the secretary-general of the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter to the president of the Security Council, Egypt's permanent representative to the U.N., Nabil Elaraby, expressed the hope that the council would reflect &quot;the will of the majority&quot; in its decision on which candidate to recommend to the General Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 185-member assembly elects a secretary-general on the recommendation of the 15-member council.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The candidature of Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali enjoys wide support by the majority of the U.N. membership,&quot; the Egyptian ambassador said in the letter, dated Nov. 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As you know, two major regional organizations, the Organization of African Unity and the League of Arab States, have endorsed H.E. Dr. Boutros Boutros- Ghali for a second full term as secretary-general of the U.N.,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a private lunch in New York on Tuesday to discuss the election procedure, the council agreed that informal consultations on the election would start next Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States has vowed to bar Boutros-Ghali, using its veto if necessary, from a second term on accusations of not pursuing enough reforms at the world body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But other veto-wielding members of the council--China, France, Britain and Russia--support Boutros-Ghali's re-election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though the secretary-general, whose current five-year term will expire on Dec. 31, is the only official candidate for the election, other names have been mentioned in recent times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They include the UN under-secretary-general for peace-keeping operations, Kofi Annan, a Ghanaian, the president of the International Peace Academy in New York, Olara Otunnu of Uganda and the secretary-general of the Islamic Conference, Hamid Algabid of Niger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, members of the council have agreed that if the U.S. vetoes Boutros-Ghali as threatened, Africa should be given the chance to produce a list of other candidates for consideration before candidates from other regions are allowed to come in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The understanding is that Africa deserves a second term,&quot; a source close to the council said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ROME, Italy (PANA) - Some 195,000 refugees could die within a month unless there is &quot;massive intervention&quot; in eastern Zaire now, a ranking United Nations official said Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Catherine Bertini, the executive director of the World Food Programme, said in a news conference here that 80,000 children were affected by starvation in the region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Children are particularly at risk especially those who have started breast- feeding,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees are fleeing the ongoing three-way fight between the Zairean army, Rwandan Hutu militia and Zairean Tutsi rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bertini, who is attending the World Food Summit, said a multinational force which is being readied for deployment in eastern Zaire will have to first separate the Hutu militia from the refugees if food delivery is to be immediate and effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her agency has enough food for the 1.2 million refugees who are fleeing northward from Goma, westward from Bukavu and Uvira, and south from Uvira toward Fizi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is, she said, &quot;there is not a clear indication of where they are&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said that two United States aircraft from Entebbe, Uganda flying low to locate the refugees, suspended their operations after being fired on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the agency has a C-130 Hercules military aircraft standing by to begin airdrops as soon as the refugees are located and &quot;as soon as it is safe&quot; to conduct the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency has food prepositioned in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzanian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assistant executive director of the World Food Programme, Jean-Jacques Graisse, told PANA that the agency could make deliveries to Bukuvu and Uvira so long as it gets permission from Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said, many of the agencies vehicles have been stolen by retreating Zairean government troops.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MBABANE, Swaziland (PANA) - Swazi Finance Minister Derek von Wissell resigned Wednesday because he could no longer clean up the mess at a state- owned bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wissel, the first ever cabinet minister to resign, quit 15 hours after a reshuffle Tuesday, that relegated him to the lesser portfolio of tourism and communications.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than accept the new posting, he quit on a matter of principle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only conclusion I can draw from being moved in a new portfolio is that government no longer supports the work I started at SDSB (Swaziland Development and Savings Bank),&quot; he said in press release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would be impossible for me to be part of such a government, and I have therefore resigned from cabinet with immediate effect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said in his pursuit of his duties at SDSB &quot;my conscience refused to allow me to acquiesce to the abuse of tax payers' money and even corrupt practices...My actions obviously created enemies for me in so-called 'high places'.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Licari, who was attending a presentation of medical equipment, commended &quot; the great political will&quot; of the Senegalese government in contributing troops to the Canadian-led force.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides Senegal, six other African countries--Ethiopia, Eritrea, Congo, Cameroon, Mali and South Africa--have announced their desire to contribute troops to the force to provide humanitarian assistance to the more than one million refugees in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Licari said Canada decided to take the command of the deployment operation of the neutral multinational force following &quot;diplomatic hesitations&quot; by the international community, adding that consultations are continuing &quot;between various countries&quot; for the setting up of the force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the Senegalese government expressed its total support to the establishment of the force.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - Three Egyptian fundamentalists of the opposition Gama'a Al-Islamiya, who were sentenced to death in September for involvement in an abortive attempt on the life of President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa in June 1995, have appealed to the Ethiopian federal supreme court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman of the Addis Ababa central high court, which found the defendants guilty, was quoted by the government press Thursday as saying that the Ethiopian defence lawyer for the convicts had submitted to the court a 13- point deputation appealing its verdict of Sept. 21, 10 days after the sentence was passed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the sentence is upheld by the supreme court, the death penalty will only be carried out after the final approval of President Negasso Gidada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three convicts had been identified earlier as Sofit Hassen Abdul Kabi, Abdul Karim Naddi and Al-Arib Sadik. They had pleaded not guilt to the charges and were tried in camera beginning April 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were found guilty of complicity in the attempted assassination of Mubarak and the killing of two policemen on duty at the time of the incident on June 26, 1995, in which three civilians were also wounded. The trio were also charged on smuggling fire arms, including grenade launchers, through the Sudan Airways office in Addis Ababa, into the country as part of the assassination plot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three convicts were said to be part of an 11-man Egyptian hit squad sponsored by the Gama'a Al-Islamiya, trained in Pakistan. Nine of the men entered Ethiopia with Yemeni, Sudanese and Egyptian passports to assassinate Mubarak as he flew into Addis Ababa from Cairo to attend an OAU summit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA, Uganda (PANA) - Zairean troops backed by Ugandan rebels Wednesday attacked the Ugandan border towns of Mpondwe and Bwera in south western district of Kasese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda's Foreign Affairs Minister, Martin Aliker told an impromptu news conference Wednesday night that a Uganda Peoples' Defence Force platoon at Karambi, seven kilometers (4.4 miles) northwest of Bwera and Mpondwe border posts had been attacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the attackers were a combination of Zairean forces and some Ugandan dissidents trained in Zaire. However, the minister could not name the dissident groups involved in the attack.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not know the names but we are aware that Ugandan dissidents were involved&quot; Aliker said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the raiders were repulsed and three of them were killed but &quot; shelling has continued sporadically most of the day from the Zairean side&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the attack, Uganda sent heavy reinforcements to the scene from the nearby towns of Mbarara and Fort Portal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eye witness reports from Kasese say that the rebels started shooting at around 7.30 a.m local time before taking the customs post 30 minutes later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scared residents claimed that about 50 people were feared dead including the headmaster of Karambi Secondary School and some of his students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aliker could not explain why Zairean troops had attacked Uganda now when they are embroiled in the Banyamurenge crisis in the east of their country. &quot; We do not know. But I think it is sheer madness for Zaire to attack us from that side. It is a diversionary attack&quot; he stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said that he could not confirm whether the attack was sanctioned by the government of Zaire, or it was a result of general lawlessness that is prevailing in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister said Uganda would not sever diplomatic relations with Zaire because they were not aware that the Zaire government had authorized the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We really sympathize with the government of Zaire because of this Banyamurenge crisis. And we are aware there is no government in eastern Zaire, so we cannot sever the ties before we have proof&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamurenge rebels, ethnic Zairean Tutsi militants, launched attacks in the eastern parts of the country nearly a month ago, with the alleged backing of Rwanda and Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zairean government has accused Uganda, too, of helping the Banyamurenge and parliament in Kinshasa passed a resolution calling for the severance of diplomatic relations with all the three countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ROME, Italy (PANA) - The heads of the African Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank are opposed to agricultural subsidies currently being applied by governments in Africa and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In plenary Thursday at the ongoing World Food Summit, the presidents of both institutions said subsidies had contributed to lower incomes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently well-intentioned but misguided practices&quot; aimed at cheap food prices for urban consumers through subsidies had only exacerbated the problem of lower farm incomes, ADB President Omar Kabbaj said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsidies, he added, &quot;contributed to the marginalization of the rural economy and to declines in the income and welfare of rural dwellers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And World Bank President James Wolfensohn told a news conference &quot;no country, in the long term, can live with subsidies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier he told world leaders at the summit that governments &quot;should reduce heavy intervention in the rural economy and concentrate on creating an economic and regulatory environment that fosters agricultural growth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Kabbaj and Wolfensohn said that the reduction of subsidies tended to nudge farmers to areas which are more efficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To compliment this, both banks have adopted new approaches to rid the poor countries of the worst types of poverty, providing mocro-financing to allow for easy credit for farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabbaj said ADB provides micro-credit to poor and vulnerable groups and has been giving credit to national and sub-regional development finance bodies so they could, in turn, lend to small and medium-scale enterprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both banks have also been working with or have policies in place to collaborate with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), who have considerable experience in implementing poverty alleviation programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will be making further strides in this area, with the finalization of a new micro-enterprise policy which will set the framework for extending appropriate credit to the poorest groups, using financial intermediaries such as NGOs and other grassroots organizations,&quot; Kabbaj said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have initially set aside some 20 million dollars (U.S) for this type of support.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria airways has sacked 250 more workers less than one year after firing 720 others as part of efforts to improve the efficiency of the financially troubled national carrier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The airline's spokesman, Chris Aligbe, said in a statement in Lagos Thursday that the 250 were sacked either for &quot;indiscipline or declining productivity, excessive leave and absenteeism.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sack &quot;cuts across the senior and junior cadre&quot; of staff, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A combination of debt burden and maintenance problem has reduced the airway's fleet from about 20 aircraft several years ago to only four operational today. Some planes were seized by creditors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The estimated 4,000 work force eats deep into the airline's scarce revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its managing director, Group Capt. Peter Gana, has promised to sanitize the organisation by instilling discipline and reducing the work force to the barest minimum.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said at a news briefing in Kinshasa on Thursday that the crisis in eastern Zaire was partly caused by the non-respect of the decisions of a national conference held four years ago by the political class.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference named Tshisekedi Prime Minister but the latter was relieved of the post months later by Mobutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The crisis facing Zaire resulted from the mismanagement of the country by political leaders whose sole interest is to make money,&quot; said Tshisekedi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to a question on the suggestion that a separate territory to be known as Hutuland be carved out as a way of solving the ethnic problem in Burundi and Rwanda, he said &quot;Zairians will never accept to surrender a square millimeter of their territory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, A local newspaper Friday accused Tshisekedi of being pro-Tutsi regarding the ongoing war in eastern Zaire, where Zairian Tutsi called the Banyamurenge have seized Zairian territory reportedly with support from the Tutsi government in Kigali.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event will mark the end of a week-long national funeral rites that involved several cities which were linked with the elder statesman, who died May 11. Saturday would be his 92nd birth day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Zungeru in the north to Lagos, Enugu and Onitsha, his ancestral home, it has been a feast of tributes to the late Nigerian nationalist, sportsman journalist and Pan-Africanist.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of foreign leaders are expected at the burial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidents of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Equatorial Guinea were among dignitaries that attended Zik's lying in state Tuesday in Abuja, the Nigerian capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zik's body also laid in state in key cities in northern Nigeria where was born, in the west, where he grew up and worked, and in the east, his ancestral home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a demonstration of his firm believe in national unity, the three major tribes of multi-ethnic Nigeria -- the Hausas in the north, the Yorubas in the west, especially Lagos, and the Igbos in the east, have sought to outdo each other in paying glowing tributes to the former president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs in a tribute said &quot;Zik was a detribalised Nigerian who got on very well with everyone, regardless of tribe, religion, age or social status.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian head of state Gen. Sani Abacha renamed the Abuja international airport after Azikiwe as a mark of honor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even in death, Zik continued to win admirers from high and low, at home and abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Enugu on Thursday, a mock parliamentary session was held in honor of Zik, the politician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a tribute titled &quot;Zik, the ultimate philosopher, pathfinder,&quot; former military ruler Gen. Ibrahim Babangida said &quot;we have to commit Zik to the earth with pride in us that our founding fathers had not lived in vain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They will continue to be remembered for their great attributes as motivators, disciplined visionaries and perfect examples that we can always be,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In yet another, Kenyan Historian, Ali Mazrui, says of Zik: &quot;when he combined certificate in law, a qualification in journalism, a masters in religion and philosophy, masters in anthropology, expertise in political science, Nnamdi Azikiwe was prophecy-incarnate signifying Africa's academic versatility when given half-a-chance.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambian President Frederick Chiluba has told South African President Nelson Mandela that it is &quot;impossible&quot; to postpone Monday's elections since the 11 opposition parties participating in the elections have opposed postponement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his letter, dated 14 Nov. to Mandela which was made available to PANA Friday, he also said that the proposition to postpone the elections was totally impossible because of the &quot;astronomical&quot; costs incurred spent by the participating parties and in view of limited resources.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Postponement of the elections scheduled for next monday 18 November, 1996 is a totally impossible proposition which the principal opposition parties taking part in the elections have also said they will not accept,&quot; part of the letter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba maintained there is no threat to the internal security and stability to warrant a draconian move like a state of emergency, as suggested, to facilitate the postponement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela early this week held private consultations with Chiluba in Pretoria.  He later sent South African constitutional court judge Richard Goldstone to explore possibilities of postponing the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition Zambia Democratic Congress, (ZDC) which is one of the political parties taking part in the elections, confirmed to PANA that it had refused to accept the suggestion of postponing the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not for the idea of extending the elections,&quot; said the party's general secretary, Derrick Chitala. &quot;We had made it clear that we would only agree if we were compensated the money spent on elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) has directed its cadres to physically close down polling stations where severe anomalies will arise on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZDC deputy secretary general, Azwell Banda, said from Mpulungu yesterday that unless the 'toothless' Electoral Commission responds to the serious anomalies identified on the register before Monday, ZDC sees no other option but &quot;war&quot; on November 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have spent lot of time and money over this matter, and we will not allow any fraud to take away our liberty to choose the leaders of our choice,&quot; Banda warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ZDC call was made after it discovered that several voters in some polling stations have been wrongly transfered to other polling stations several miles apart.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole of Gonda Barracks which is part of Chipata Central Constituency is now appearing in Kasenengwa Constituency. This means Gonda voters will on Monday not find their names at their polling station,&quot; Banda observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party has now placed election agents and 'instant reactors' in all the 150 constituencies to check out for any serious anomalies on Monday and if necessary offer physical resistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have written the Electoral Commission chairman Bobby Bwalya to ask him to give express instructions to returning officers to close down any polling station where serious anomalies will occur on Monday. If he fails to do this our instruction to our members are to do whatever it takes to forcibly close the stations,&quot; Banda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Post yesterday noted more contradictions in the voters' roll with several polling stations vanishing from their constituencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An advert placed in yesterday's Times of Zambia by Ndola town clerk and district returning officer Emmanuel Chenda to publicise polling stations of the four constituencies in his district has exposed discrepancies in the number of polling stations in various registers produced by Nikuv.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chenda's advert shows the number of polling stations for Ndola Central to be 36, but this has contradicted the Election Commissions-Nikuv Summary document on elections, which puts polling stations in Ndola central at 23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chenda's advert claims Kabushi has 43 polling station but the Nikuv Summary shows 49.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Chenda has advertised 35 polling stations for Chifubu the Nikuv Summary has entered voters' names in 31 polling station in the same area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another affected area is Bwana Mkubwa where Chenda is telling the voters of 34 polling stations against the Nikuv Summary of 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But another document of the Electoral Commission, a white Consolidated volume of polling stations produced by Nikuv contradicts both the Summary and Chenda's advertised information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from Ndola Central which tallies at 36 the rest are startling with Kabushi having 50 polling stations, Chifubu 30 and Bwana Mkubwa 32.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And three people in Choma were yesterday found in possession of two voters cards each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But acting Director of Elections, Joel Sikazwe, maintained &quot;it was not possible for one person to possess two voters cards&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is not possible unless you can show me to prove that you have the cards,&quot; Sikazwe said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to investigations by The Post, Muleya Ruth has two voters cards carrying similar details but from two different polling districts and different dates of issue - voter number: 801030/0081: Reg No 113847/73/1 Name: MULEYA RUTH; Residential address: HANYANGA SINGANI SIALUMBA, CHOMA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polling District name: SUNTWE Box/batch No 0258/03 Date of Birth: 21/01/62 issued: Oct 96.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other differences on Muleya's other card are the date of issue which indicates June 1996 and date of birth which appears as 16/12/60. The polling district reads TANCHI but both from Mbabala Constituency in Choma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other persons with two cards each are Mudenda Vaileti and Simango Elson also from the same Constituency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Post investigations recently revealed that there were about 17,000 ghost voters due to duplication of national registration cards and misplacement of names in the voters registers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sikazwe said: &quot;I am not aware about all those anomalies. But if they are there, a person will only be allowed to vote once. It's one man one vote.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - President Frederick Chiluba has turned down a request from South African President, Nelson Mandela, that he declares a state of emergency over Zambia so as to postpone the November 18 elections and accomodate opposition UNIP and former President Kenneth Kaunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Chiluba revealed this during his tour of Kabwata constituency today to check on the MMD campaign progress and preparedness for the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chiluba said Mr Mandela sent a fax message to him to declare a state of emergence to facilitate a possible postponement of the November 18 elections for the sake of UNIP President, Dr Kenneth Kaunda.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In reply Mr Chiluba told Mr Mandela that there is no need for a state of emergence because there is no crisis in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He reteirated that elections will go ahead as scheduled because five presidential candidates as well as more than 500 parliamentary candidate are contesting the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said government will not interfere with the electoral commission, the only organ empowered to delay or postpone elections as doing so would defeat the very democratic purpose for which it was instituted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not possible to instruct the electoral commission to postpone elections because I will be accused of political interferance,&quot; Mr Chiluba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday this week President Chiluba met Mr Mandela in South Africa to discuss possible solutions to the election boycott undertaken by UNIP and its President Kenneth Kaunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of Kabwata residents thronged arround Mr Chiluba who toured markets in the constituency including Kamwala market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security personnel had a tough time controlling masses of people striving to have a glimpsy of Mr Chiluba who urged the voters to vote for Vice President, Brigadier-Geneneral Godfrey Miyanda as area MP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chiluba expressed disatisfaction at the state of roads in the area and other facilities which are in a deplorable state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chiluba also met party officials in the contituency who welcomed him with ululations, songs and party slogans. He urged them to rally behind Gen Miyanda so that the MMD programme started in the area would continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Miyanda, who also accompanied the president, assured Mr Chiluba that the party in the constituency was solid and voters were fully geared to vote for him and Mr Chiluba because MMD was the only party with good development policies for the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chiluba told MMD cadres in the constituence that they only have today and Sunday to campaign hence the need for a vigorious approach to woo more people to vote for MMD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He assured the nation that the elections will go ahead and they will be peaceful despite plans by UNIP to use its vigilante wing to disrupt Monday's elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said alert law enforcement officers will ensure peace prevails during the elections adding that those who have boycotted the November polls are wasting their time since the country can not afford losing billions of Kwacha by postponing the elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Human Rights Association of Zambia has cautioned foreign countries against interfering in the internal affairs of the country because Zambians are capable of deciding their own destiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Association president, Dr Dixon Konkola, said at a press briefing today that there is no need for foreign intervention because there was no crisis in the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said foreigners have no right to dictate to the country on how to conduct the elections as Zambians are mature and experienced enough to solve problems.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Konkola also described as unfortunate and undemocratic the colection of voters cards by UNIP under its leader Kenneth Kaunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Dr Kaunda should be persuaded by his political experience that the best way to change a government is by participating in the elections instead of boycotting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the same function secretary general of the association, Adolfas Mubanga, said law enforcement officers should respect and protect human dignity and maintain and uphold human rights during the November 18 presidential and general elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said police and security personnel should be posted in the minimum number necessary and should not be positioned in such a way as to intimidate or discourage voters from participating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mubanga also cautioned election monitors against seeking favours or being partisan adding that their role is to ensure that human rights are observed through free and fair elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said their presence decreased the likelihood of intimidation and fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Neutral and objective observers do instil confidence in the electorate and thereby increase their ability to freely express their political will in the ballot booth without fear of reprisal,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said a bigger number of monitors is needed in order to gain the attention and recognition by the electorate adding that a relationship with other monitors should be created.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mubanga has called upon the voters to turn up in big numbers and exercise their democratic right by voting without fear or intimidation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newly elected Zambia Union of Musicians (ZUM) chairman Webster Malama told The Post that the agreement which was signed by 121 countries would include blocking counterfeit goods coming into the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zambia as a developing country has been given about six years in which it is expected to educate its nationals about the agreement because after the expiry of the grace period it would mean sanctions to any country that abrogates the agreement,&quot; Malama said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malama just returned from Malawi where he attended a regional seminar on Experts of copyright and Neighbouring Copyrights in the Southern African Development Committee (SADC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A member country is supposed to offer equal protection to intellectual properties of its locals and those of foreign artists. In Africa only South Africa has been treated as a developed nation therefore is expected to observe the agreement as of January 1, 1996,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seminar was also attended by Tanzania which is regarded as the notorious piracy &quot;boy&quot; in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the first time Tanzania was represented at copyright seminar and the representatives were sympathetic with the artists of the region who had lost a lot of money through the pirated intellectual properties coming through it,&quot; said Malama</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - League leaders &quot;Mighty&quot; Mufulira Wanderers will have their toughest hurdle tomorrow as they play Lusaka Dynamos at Woodlands stadium with play-maker, Nelson Banda and their first and second choice keepers Collins Mbulo and Peter Chilufya respectively missing from the line up because of red cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wanderers have fifty-four points while their closest rivals-Zamsure , who will be away to Nkana, have fifty-two points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even without Banda, the likes of Bilton Musonda, Martin Chola, Vincent Mutale and goal thief, Paul Chellah, have the capacity to get the vital goals to push the Mufulira side further up on the league.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Allan Kamwanga, improving at the back, Wanderers trainer, George Lwandamina, will have to employ a tactic that will be able to withstand the pressure from the youthful Lusaka Dynamos side, which held Wanderers to a one- all draw at Shinde Stadioum in Mufulira when the two sides met in the first leg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alex Namazaba, Perry Mutapa, Aliford Mapataki and Milton Tembo are the players that have seen Dynamos rise from the bottom of the table to the number five slot and should Michael Mwanza maintain his grip in defence-God help Wanderers-a defeat wouldn't be far fetched for Wanderers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same venue, City of Lusaka, with Jerry Mafripa now in full charge as coach after the resignation of Fred Nasilele, will be up against relegation- bound Lifebuoy Strikers in a game that will determine whether the Ndola side will stay in the elite of Zambia's soccer or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another game which on paper promises to be entertaining, Roan United struggling to clinch a top-eight place, will host Kabwe Warriors at Luanshya's Kafubu Stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With two defectors from Kabwe Warriors-John Lungu and Justin Sakala-in the line up, trainer Fighton Simukonda, can easily ease the pressure haunting his once Stylish side with a win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that will largely depend on the form of Warriors goalie, Davies Phiri, who on his day makes many strikers eat humble pie.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But sources say the reason the team, which was demoted to the first division from the premier league last season, is training using the hard tennis court is because of the decision by management of its former sponsors- Zambia National Profident Fund (ZNPF) to stop the soccer team from using the football pitch.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ZNPF managers told the players to look for another ground because the sports complex is only for social football and not competitive type. That is why the coach, Boniface Simutowe decided to start using the tennis court,&quot; said a source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Simutowe, in an interview on Monday, maintained his team which uses Woodlands Stadium for its league matches, will soon start using the football pitch.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - MMD's campaign chairman, Vernon Mwaanga, yesterday told off South African President Nelson Mandela over his recent role in the Zambian political impasse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwaanga told the press in Lusaka that Mandela, who is also chairman of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) has no right to advise Zambia on an election postponement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mandela yesterday sent a fax message to President Frederick Chiluba in a last minute attempt to persuade him to postpone Monday's presidential and parliamentary elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela's fax appeal to President Chiluba was revealed during his press address in Durban yesterday. He also disclosed some details of the meeting between him and President Chiluba on Monday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mandela told the press that he had agreed with President Chiluba to postpone the elections during their meeting in Pretoria on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African President was addressing the newsmedia on his role in Zambia's political crisis, and especially during his meeting with President Chiluba on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mandela said the Zambian President had given him two options under which an election can be postponed and they included an Electoral Commission announcement or declaration of a state of emergency by himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This then would automatically annul the elections date, which can be announced later,&quot; Mandela said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their discussion appreciated the legal questions and it was on this premise that President Mandela sent respected South African Judge Richard Goldstone to confer with the Electoral Commission on a possible postponement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela has repeated this position to various news organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Chiluba reacted favourably to the suggestion that Monday's election be postponed,&quot; Mandela told the South African Press Agency (SAPA) on Wednesday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He later told the South African Broadcasting Corporation(SABC) that he advised President Chiluba that the &quot;elections would lack legitimacy&quot; if allowed to go on in the present circumstances. He particularly pushed for a way to allow participation of the main opposition UNIP and its president Kenneth Kaunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African President reiterated the position taken by SADC at the Maseru summit and when President Chiluba visited Mandela as chairman of SADC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in Lusaka Mwaanga, whom President Chiluba had been using to explain his government's position on the elections to SADC and other African leaders, dismissed Mandela's effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mandela has no right to tell us to postpone an election. We have run this country for 32 years and we have the integrity and sovereignty to make our own decisions,&quot; Mwaanga said. &quot;We cannot be given instructions like school children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwaanga, who last week accused the United States and Japanese governments of funding some civic organisations to cause anarchy in the country, maintained the elections are going on as scheduled because MMD has &quot;cleared all anxieties over elections in meetings with opposition parties&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But former Circuit Holdings managing director, Malcom Freed who is in South Africa revealed that Mandela's press address placed emphasis on SADC reaction should President Chiluba defy the subregion's plea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If President Chiluba will go ahead with the presidential and parliamentary elections on Monday, November 18 the SADC will never recognise the results of such an election,&quot; Freed quotes the South African President as having told the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the Zambian Independent Monitoring Team and the Committee for a Clean Campaign have described Mwaanga's comments on President Mandela as unfair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;MMD is treating this election like a party matter. We cannot have elections without sorting out the outstanding issues,&quot; said CCC leader Ngande Mwanajiti.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZIMT leader Gershom Musonda added: &quot;MMD is just not serious about this election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Electoral Commission chairman, justice Bobby Bwalya, briefing the press yesterday following discussions he held with Justice Goldstone, said the prevailing political situation in the country does not warrant the imposition of a state of emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a commission we feel that the present situation does not warrant the imposition of a state of emergency because on the ground the situation is peaceful,&quot; Bwalya said. &quot;This is the most highly contested election in the history of our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bwalya made the remarks after he had earlier disclosed that postponement of the elections was one of the options discussed by President Frederick Chiluba and President Mandela, as one of the solutions to resolve the current political impasse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier on Wednesday, commission vice-chairman Meebelo Kalima also said a state of emergency could only be imposed &quot;where there was a war or the nation was torn apart&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Lusaka lawyer Sakwiba Sikota said it was not up to the Commission to determine whether &quot;conditions warrant a state of emergency or not&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that President Chiluba disrupted his campaign midway to travel to South Africa over the electoral process shows there is a crisis. Hence discussing the possibilities of postponement with SADC chairman President Mandela,&quot;Sikota said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The polls which have been boycotted by the main opposition party UNIP has attracted 150 parliamentary candidates from the ruling MMD closely followed by 142 from the Zambia Democratic Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Party is fielding 99 candidates while there are 96 candidates standing as independents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newly formed National Lima Party and Agenda for Zambia are each fielding 83 and 11 respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Congress, Real Democratic Party, Movement for Democratic Process and Poor Peoples Party have a total of 8 candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Bwalya also said two candidates had filed their nomination papers on UNIP ticket and symbol while one was said to have filed on the Liberal Progressive Front(LPF) ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both UNIP and LPF, who are boycotting the polls recently indicated that their members who opted to contest the elections would do so as independents.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Aero Zambia has 'fired' seven of their 12 pilots after they downed tools last Friday demanding better conditions of service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aero's management on Monday wrote letters to the seven pilots who had withdrawn their services that the airline had accepted their &quot;resignations&quot; when they had not in fact resigned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pilots had on Thursday, November 7, written to management informing them of the strike action but suffered a rude awakening on Monday when they were greeted by letters from management accepting resignations that never were.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We wrote them (management) a letter informing them that we were withdrawing our labour until our conditions of service were reviewed but did not resign,&quot; one of the pilots disclosed in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those affected are Captain George Parkingson, Captain Musaka Mudenda, and First Officers - Victor Lemba, Osward Mukuka, George Sinkala, Pereira Kopolo and Katongo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pilots have complained of poor salaries which they quoted as below US$1, 000 a month the failure by the airline to pay them allowances and the lack of a sound insurance policy for the pilots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pilots in the region are paid monthly salaries of between US$3,000 and US$5, 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group disclosed that they had been promised better conditions just when the airline took off after Zambia Airways' demise but had continued working under their initial conditions a year after.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They claim they have had meetings with management since April last year but were told to &quot;hold on&quot; as the airline was just being established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In June this year we had meetings again but nothing fruitful came out. In July it was the same case and later in October we gave them up to November 7 but still nothing happened. So on Friday we wrote the letters to management informing them about our withdrawal of labour,&quot; one of the pilot who sought anonymity said, adding: &quot;But on Monday the deputy managing director, Mengistu called us and gave us letters stating that our resignations had been accepted.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when contacted for comment on the matter, Aero Zambia deputy managing director, Yewondessen Mengistu, denied knowledge of the strike action and the firing of the seven pilots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is news to us. Our pilots have never been on strike and everything is just normal here,&quot; Mengistu said in an interview, adding:&quot;We only have two pilots who have resigned and we have accepted their resignations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He disclosed that the resignations were with effect from the November 8 at 08:15 hours and his airlines would not take on any more pilots as there was adequate staff to run operations but denied to give reasons behind the resignations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mengistu has further denied reports about engaging Mozambican pilots to fill up the staffing gap left by the alleged strike action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have already said that we have adequate staff to handle operations so there are no plans to take on other pilots,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile internal sources confirmed the Mozamairlines unchanged schedules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although we are flying , it is only the four pilots that are working in fact two pilots from Mozambique joined us yesterday and this has affected our flight schedule,&quot; the aviation source disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And further commenting on the four pilots that are still flying, the fired pilots cautioned the airline not to over-work them because this could prove disastrous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The guys are being overworked. A tired pilot is a danger in the sky because his reflexes are impaired, anything can happen,&quot; one of the pilots warned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Whether you regard it as a tasteless eyesore or as a symbol of our status as a modern metropolis, the Coca Cola sign that crowns Ponte City in Berea is not simply a conspicuous feature of the Johannesburg skyline, but a technological marvel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A look inside a flashy new mag, Sign &amp; Graphics, tells a quite extraordinary story about how this structure came to be there. The steel structure itself, at 151m wide by 15m high, and weighing 6,4 tonnes, took four months for Natanya Signs to install.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eye-catching, red-and-white effect is made up of no less than 2 250 individual glass units. Each unit had to be manually bent into shape, inserted with an electrode that controls the electrical current, and pumped with gas - either neon or argon, depending on the colour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erecting the neon glass on to the structure took some truly phenomenal acrobatics. A monorail had to be constructed around the circumference of the structure so that the glass could be manually installed - an undertaking that took six weeks of dawn- 'til-dusk work. This is not surprising if you keep in mind the amount of glass involved: with 1 900m of white neon glass and 2 300m of red neon glass, if it was all laid end-to-end it would stretch from Ponte City to the Johannesburg Zoo (measured by car, not by crow).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because there was no power supply to the roof, a cable weighing 1 200kg had to be hauled up 19 floors - by hand. A housing area had to be specially built on the roof to accommodate all the computer and electrical switchgear equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The computer programme itself, which controls the sequences of the neon lights, is said to be one of the most advanced of its kind. Called the &quot; computerised theatre control system&quot;, the idea is to allow flexibility in programming the light sequences. This also means a complex and time-consuming task from an electrician's point of view, since each circuit has to be separately wired. The end result is an ever- fresh &quot;storyboard&quot; that can be changed as often as you please.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the power required by this ultimate billboard? The total power that the sign uses when it lights up is 196 650 watts - an incredible amount of energy if you consider that an average household would use about 5 000 watts at peak times (a roast in the oven, a few hot baths, light bulbs burning). The energy the sign uses each moment is therefore equivalent to the energy that would be used by 39 busy households.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coca-Cola will be occupying this site for at least the next 10 years, so those of you who howl about the flashing icon better start getting used to it!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg has the (dubious) honour of being home to what is officially the largest Coca-Cola sign in Africa - an honour earned by our nation's top- 10 position in the worldwide hierarchy of soft-drink consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Couchman, presence manager of Coca- Cola Southern Africa, describes the sign as &quot;a face lift&quot; to the sagging city skyline, giving us a landmark that puts us on a par with international centres such as &quot;Times Square, Piccadilly Circus, Hong Kong and Beijing&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Namaqualand - Few people taking a stroll along a beach would notice this small, white, pebble-like object. A dentist should recognise it as a tooth, says French palaeontologist Dr Brigitte Senut. &quot;And if he didn't, I wouldn't want to go to him!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it takes experts in palaeontology like Senut and her research partner Dr Martin Pickford to identify it as a fossil and understand its significance.  For this small, irregular tooth is a new piece in the jigsaw puzzle of evolution, an exciting discovery for two people who scour the world for new information about how humans and other species developed into their present- day forms.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a little like detective work - reconstructing a scene from some leftover details. This detail, our palaeontologists can tell us, is the 18- million-year-old tooth of a hominoid, ape-like creatures from which both apes and humans evolved; and it shows that this group, from the prehistory of man, was not confined to East Africa, as some have theorised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># The finding of the tooth was a &quot;a bit of serendipity&quot;, says Pickford.  Pickford, from the College de France, and Senut, from France's National Natural History Museum, are part of the Palaeontology Expedition to South Africa, a co-operative French-South African project that has been carrying out research in Namaqualand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year ago, they met Dudley Wessels, manager of Redaurum diamond mine near Hondeklip Bay, and an amateur fossil collector. They encouraged him to look out for fossils and hold on to them, and on this most recent visit, he showed them what he had found. Among the things he had spotted in the gravel turned up by the mining operations was the hominoid tooth, as well as the teeth of pigs and of a carnivore now extinct, called the bear-dog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then the detective work started. The tooth's age could not be determined from the usual methods of carbon dating (carbon dating only measures up to 100 000 years ago) and potassium argon dating (because it relies on volcanic layers around a fossil).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the tooth resembles that of a Kenyapithecus, the hominoids found so liberally in Kenya and Uganda, and the other teeth seem to confirm this diagnosis - they are found wherever Kenyapithecus occurs and plenty of specimens have come from East Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next step was to figure out how this find fitted or changed the current notions of how humans evolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Pickford: &quot;Darwin predicted Africa would be the birthplace of mankind.  The question was which part of Africa and what kind of animal (would we have evolved from).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senut and Pickford say the Rift Valley of East Africa was generally accepted as this place, mostly because so many hominoid fossils have been found there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the past 10 years, some finds have begun to cast doubt on this hypothesis. Senut and Pickford say that part of the jaw of a hominoid was found in Saudi Arabia about a decade or more ago, but for some reason, not much attention was paid to the discovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">#But in 1990, a researcher found an arm bone in Egypt that turned out to belong to a hominoid. Add their discovery, and the evolutionary picture begins to change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what about the million-dollar question: is this one of our ancestors?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senut and Pickford can't say, and are not impressed with the whole concept of &quot;the missing link&quot; - the idea we can find one fossil that will definitively show us what animal we are descended from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Evolution isn't like that,&quot; they both say. Because evolving is a process of slow change by degrees, there's no one particular ancestor. The creature whose tooth has turned up on our shores can only be described as part of the group from which we and the apes have grown. But where it and its counterparts turn up can show us where in the world we originated from.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Last week, delegates gathered at the second United Nations regional conference on space technology for sustainable development to ponder the effective use of space technology for local needs in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were mostly convinced that space technology was an important, if not essential, development tool and agreed on several areas where space technology could be used. Among them were communications and information technology, disaster prediction and management, education, energy, environmental management, food security, health care, rural and urban development, and transport.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The success of the conference could be measured in the large number of participants from Africa and other areas and the eagerness of African delegates to learn from each other and explore the use of the science to help develop their countries. Moreover, the conference raised some awareness in Southern Africa of the usefulness of space science and education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as they gathered to explore the way forward, a few questions came to mind. Where do we go from here? How will the recommendations of this meeting be put into practice? And most importantly: will Africans ever be more than consumers of space technology products?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The experience of India provides some good answers. India is arguably one of the most impressive cases of space science development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has managed to raise space science to a level never before attained in a developing country to address disaster relief, food security issues, crop and weather monitoring, and many other areas. Today, India is a producer and exporter of space products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first step for Africa in following this example is to enlist political motivation for the use of space technology to address local needs. Political leaders in African countries have to be seen to support space science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other critical ingredient for success is the mastery of the economics of space technology. To accomplish this, African countries have to collaborate with resource- rich countries. But they must pay their way in the partnership, by allocating funds for space science within their national budgets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if an African regional space technology consortium is created, African leaders should avoid addressing multiple-purpose development issues. They should tackle common, unique and cross-border issues so that resources are used effectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The focus should not simply be on developing satellites. Owning a satellite does not guarantee that local needs will be met. The important thing is the effective use of satellite products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A French strategic management specialist once said: &quot;Unfortunately, human souls and minds are not fully readable from outer space.&quot; Will space technology help solve development problems in Africa? Perhaps the answers don't really lie out there, but down here, within human beings. Space proponents must ensure that they develop human potential..</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The professional career of Dr Paul Lusaka closely mirrored the recent political history of Southern Africa. A highly respected Zambian, he served variously as a Cabinet minister, plenipotentiary and principal foreign policy adviser to Kenneth Kaunda over three decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are few major events over this period with which he was not intimately involved - from Rhodesian UDI to Lancaster House, as President of the United Nations Council for Namibia, and in early negotiations on South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many South Africans know him from their days in Lusaka. A naturally modest man, he would rarely speak about his personal achievements. Often, however, others would tell how he saved senior African National Congress officials from imminent attack, arranged a travel document, or a scholarship for someone in need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka had a permanently understated and courteous air about him. But it masked an incisive mind and a superb grasp of human relations. Following the 1994 elections in South Africa, he served as an adviser to the National Peace Secretariat (NPS). I recall how, on his first day in the country, Tony Gildenhuys despatched him to Durban to mediate a taxi conflict. With typical phlegm he accepted, although he had not been in the country, save as an envoy, or a student in the Fifties. He succeeded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, when he was mediating the bloody conflict between the Inkatha Freedom Party and the ANC in Bhambayi, he disappeared for two days into the community. Asked afterwards to explain why he did the manifestly inadvisable, he explained that the entire community had wanted to slaughter a goat for him.  He succeeded in getting that peace agreement too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His skill as a negotiator stemmed from his natural authority and integrity.  For the past three years he worked as a Commonwealth expert in South Africa for the NPS, the Training Institute of the Department of Foreign Affairs and then Comtask.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chair of Comtask, Mandla Langa, recently described his &quot;warmth and unflappable, avuncular style&quot; in this paper. Both Comtask and the NPS were voluble and energetic fora. But anyone attending those meetings will testify that when Lusaka spoke, you could hear the proverbial pin drop. He had a knack of getting people back on track, and to essentials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka was a true internationalist who always recalled his close connection with Canada (McGill his alma mater, and Canada the country which provided diplomatic training, and where he met his wife, Joan). His list of postings and service, including presidency of the 39th General Assembly, are a travelogue. But he could always tell you the price of maize at home!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His early support of the move to multiparty democracy in Zambia courted unpopularity within parts of Unip. It was a matter of great sadness to him that while he worked with South Africans to entrench democracy, he saw it ebbing away in his own country. He never profited from high public office, and was distressed by the corruption in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His untimely death robs his country, and Africa, of a great public servant and distinguished diplomat. He will be missed by many in this country and beyond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka died in Washington on November 11. He was 61. A date for a memorial service in Johannesburg will be announced next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Steve Godfrey is Commonwealth Development Adviser in South Africa. He worked in South Africa with Paul Lusaka from 1993 to 1996</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Three weeks ago the Mail &amp; Guardian attempted to provoke public debate with a front page editorial advocating the introduction of something along the lines of the United States primary elections to choose a successor to Nelson Mandela as leader of the African National Congress and - by implication - president of South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal itself has drawn little support, particularly among politicians. But events this week do tend to support our belief that public debate is overdue where the succession is concerned. We refer to the fuss over The Star's front page report on Monday which suggested that Mandela had dumped Deputy President Thabo Mbeki as his favoured candidate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Briefly, the row was triggered by an interview Mandela granted to the New York Times, The Times of London and the Sowetan last week. The interview seems to have been fairly unexceptional (The Times, for example, only got around to publishing it on Tuesday). But the succession issue was canvassed, the president assuring the three newspapers that he had not chosen a successor, who would be elected by the ANC at its congress next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Star then reported Mandela had warned the national executive committee (NEC), at a meeting over the weekend, that this &quot;Mbeki bombshell&quot; was about to break in the press. It quoted an &quot;NEC source&quot; as saying that &quot;everyone was shocked&quot; and that it was taken to mean &quot;the race is on&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report drew furious denials from the ANC's Department of Information and Publicity (&quot;superficial sensationalism signifying nothing&quot;) and an indignant rebuttal from The Star's editor, Peter Sullivan (&quot;... they do not dispute any facts in our report, only the way we played it&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaving aside the rights and wrongs of the report, we would suggest that the row proves a point for us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela's assertion in the Friday interview - that he had not chosen a successor and that it would be done by congress - received scant attention, because nobody took him seriously. When The Star got word (rightly, or wrongly) that he had meant it seriously - and that it was being taken seriously by the NEC - the assertion justifiably became a bombshell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The point we would make to Mandela, with all due respect, is that he cannot have it both ways. Either next year's ANC congress will see a real exercise in democracy. In which case we will applaud it. Or they will merely go through the motions. In which case it is time for public debate on the issue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - The word &quot;august&quot; gets its very meaning from the Law Society's annual dinner. The legal eagles of Zimbabwe gathered in black tie rectitude last Saturday in the Royal Harare Golf Club, with their wives softening the crispness of the occasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Imagine Chief Justice Ted Gubbay without his shoulder-length horsehair wig, attorney-general Patrick Chinamasa without his gown and his deep frown, advocate Adrian de Bourbon not talking down to his trembling adversary; all the other judges at their ease with drinks in their hands and being thoroughly convivial: no m'ludding and my-learned-friending, just normal people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 8.30pm, the guest of honour had still not arrived, although there had been confirmation earlier that day that he would definitely be there. A phone call was made, and received the bland reply: he can't come.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was all. No explanation and no apology. It was left to an embarrassed secretary for justice to fumble his way through a hastily concocted speech before the disbelieving guests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who was the yobbo?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Robert Mugabe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing up his own judiciary is one of a series of instances of discourtesies, absences and inappropriate behaviour committed by Mugabe in recent weeks. They are giving Zimbabweans serious anxiety over the head of state, now more than ever as the country accelerates into economic and labour crises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a serious avoidance game,&quot; said John Makumbe, acting chairman of the Zimbabwe chapter of Transparency International, the Bonn-based pressure group for state accountability. &quot;It has far exceeded rational behaviour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday last week, British Trade Minister Tony Nelson was kept waiting virtually until he reached the steps of the flight back to London, without knowing whether Mugabe would find time to see him. Nelson was the first visiting British minister in 16 years of independence not to have been given time to see the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, an International Monetary Fund (IMF) team, here to gauge whether Zimbabwe had done enough to qualify for a renewal of lending it desperately needs, flew out of Harare without an interview. It was widely interpreted as an opportunity for Mugabe to smooth over his injudicious denunciation of the bank as a &quot;blind dictator&quot; last month, but he ignored it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Nowak, the IMF Southern Africa divisional chief, wondered whether Mugabe's attack was &quot;an indication of a lack of commitment&quot; to the economic reforms the bank wants to see. Zimbabwe did not qualify for the cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If his schedule is too busy to fit in eminent people with the will to lend a good word in global business circles for the Zimbabwean economy, surely he remains a man of the people?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sorry. October 10 was the 50th anniversary of Goromonzi Secondary School just outside Harare, the country's first black government high school, with alumni who comprise many of the Cabinet and Zimbabwe's senior black professionals. The school was telephoned an hour before to be told he was too busy to attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after he was due at Kwenda mission in Chikomba communal land, where his heavy-lidded young wife, Grace, hails from. They, too, had to find a replacement for the guest of honour within an hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International travel continues to take a large bite out of his crowded diary. On Monday night he flew to Italy, via London, two days ahead of the World Food Conference he is due to address. Add to this trips to Cape Town, Maseru, Hamburg, Vienna, Geneva, Accra, Ouagadougo, Luanda, Kingston, and Yaounde that he has flown to since his extraordinarily expensive wedding in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was on the eve of a planned general strike that he left for Rome, while a strike by nurses and junior doctors in Harare was into its fourth week and had spread to Bulawayo and Mutare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lives of thousands of urban poor have been made a misery by the lack of medical services. Mugabe's response has been a refusal to talk to the strikers, to sack them and a so-far failed attempt to replace them with expatriates from South Africa and Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strike flopped, but the timing of Mugabe's departure for Rome did not go unnoticed by Morgan Tsvangirai, the secretary-general of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), who asked if the president thought he was Vasco da Gama. &quot;There is no excuse for not doing your work,&quot; he fumed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Things are falling apart at home,&quot; said Makumbe. &quot;But Mugabe seems to have gone back to boyhood, falling in love with Grace, and taking her all over the world, telling her, 'let me show you Rome'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mobutu and Mugabe are the only African leaders enjoying themselves in Europe while their countries are cracking up. It's a pity.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - The Namibian government's failure to release the whole of a report on official corruption has underlined concerns that the authorities here are unwilling to tackle graft within their own ranks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Hage Geingob tabled the final part of the report of the Frank Commission probe into governnment irregularities in Parliament two weeks ago, 16 months after it was handed over to President Sam Nujoma by commission chairman, Judge Theo Frank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the first three Frank Commission reports covering government irregularities from the time of Namibia's independence in 1990 until 1992 have never been released, and no action has ever been taken on the findings.  Nor does it appear that any action has been taken on recommendations of the final released section of the report.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that allegations dating back to 1990 remain unresolved has fuelled speculation that the government is turning a blind eye to corruption particularly when it concerns senior members of the ruling party, the South West African People's Organisation (Swapo).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allen Liebenberg, general secretary of one Namibia's smaller opposition parties, the United Democratic Front, claims that the Frank reports are being withheld to hide the depth of corruption they uncovered. As a result of government inaction, he says, &quot;Corruption has become the order of the day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unreleased findings of the Frank report are believed to deal with pension fraud, the flouting of tender board regulations and the irregular acquisition of communal farming land by politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geingob has said the significance of the Frank report has been exaggerated by the media. He told national television that the Frank findings mainly concerned the actions of officials from the previous administration before independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Frank Commission saga is not the only instance of long-running government probes either failing to resolve allegations or having their findings ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1994 the current Minister of Justice Ngarikutuke Tjiriange and the then deputy minister of home affairs, Nangolo Ithete, were found to have misused drought aid to drill boreholes at an ostrich farm they owned in a communal farming area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite damning evidence presented by a probe chaired by the head of Namibia's Public Service Commission, Willie Brits, the government refused to take any action against the two ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cases against government officials accused of misconduct also take years rather than months to clear up. The head of the state veterinary laboratory, Otto Hubschle, is facing long-standing allegations concerning the irregular production and sale of animal vaccines in Angola and Namibia, dating back to 1992. He has now had his misconduct hearing postponed until February next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, the failure to resolve the case is affecting South African confidence in the quality of Namibian beef imports, according to veterinary sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are fears that the failure to punish those found responsible is encouraging more official fraud. This year the government has been rocked by claims that food intended for use in its drought relief scheme has been diverted for private profit. The case is currently the subject of a police investigation. Two weeks ago the head of Namibia's state housing company was arrested in connection with allegations that R10- million intended for a low- income housing scheme had been stolen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hartmut Ruppel, a board member of the Namibian chapter of the anti- corruption organisation, Transparency International, and a Swapo MP, has expressed concern at the slow pace of official probes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The wheels of justice don't turn like an electric motor, but they should at least turn,&quot; he says. Ruppel would like to see institutions like the Tender Board and the office of the ombudsman beefed up to prevent future corruption cases. He cites Nujoma's recent order of 800 Chevrolet vehicles from General Motors in Detroit for R146-million as a case in which the Tender Board was bypassed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even if there is no corruption, if there is a lack of openness one does not have the same confidence in the transaction,&quot; Ruppel says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goma - The first rebel recruiting table was set up outside Goma post office, a building which ceased to serve its original function several years ago when the Zairean government stopped delivering the mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were no volunteers in sight to join the insurgents who have seized Goma and swathes of eastern Zaire in recent weeks. Perhaps it was all too public. No one can be sure who will be in charge of the city next week. The recruiting table disappeared.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of Goma's residents are in two minds about their new masters. So far as much of the city's population is concerned Goma has been invaded by Rwandan Tutsis in pursuit of Rwandan Hutu extremists. They know a foreigner when they see one, and strange looks and languages are everywhere. But foreign or not, the insurgents are still generally preferred to what went before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a sad reflection on how low President Mobutu Sese Seko has dragged Zaire that most of Goma's residents fear the rebel occupiers less than the army which was supposed to defend the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The rebels are not as bad as the Zairean soldiers. Zaireans were terrible.  The Zaireans took everything. Radios, televisions, everything. The Rwandans just steal money from us,&quot; said one young man among a crowd only too keen to be able to finally deride Mobutu in public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Jules Kubuya Songe, administrator of Goma hospital which has been mortared by both sides and looted by its own patients, is sanguine about the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So long as they don't kill us, so long as they don't steal from us, so long as there is security, then it's OK,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goma residents have learned to live with upheaval. Nineteen years ago the giant Nyiragongo volcano blew, gushing a stream of molten lava to just short of the heart of the city. In Goma they talk of hundreds of deaths as entire villages disappeared under the lava. Pictures of the eruption still adorn the city's bars and restaurants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1990s brought a blight of army-led looting which hit almost every Zairean town and city. Unpaid soldiers tore through Goma four years ago. A few months later the troops were hungry again. This time they were good enough to approach Goma's administrators and warn them that its residents faced a choice - raise enough cash to pay the military or face another bout of looting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As most of the shops had already been plundered, people knew their homes would be the next target. A frantic scramble to gather cash culminated with people carrying cardboard boxes full of money into a local bank. Only half the money the army demanded was raised, but it was enough. The military took the cash and left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The calm was short lived. In July 1994, one million people walked across the border from Rwanda. They died in their tens of thousands of cholera and dysentery on the hard volcanic lava spilled 17 years earlier. Goma's residents died too, but it was little noticed by an outside world more concerned with the refugees who have haunted the city ever since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year came the war. Goma has been mortared, besieged and plundered.  Food supplies have been cut off since the rebels seized the town. A trickle of aid which rolled in this week has still to be distributed. It was, in any case, something of a Trojan horse. Aid agencies brought food to Goma in the hope it would open access to the vast numbers of Rwandan refugees the other side of rebel lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kubuya Songe - who is among those who take the view their city has been invaded by Rwanda - says that if it were not for the Rwandan refugees no one would have taken any notice of the hardships inflicted on the city. And he believes that as soon as the refugees have gone, Goma's people will be forgotten again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All these organisations come. All these journalists come. All they say is 'refugees, refugees, refugees'. Everything comes with the refugees and everything leaves with them. What does anyone do for Goma?&quot; the doctor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His own hospital could do with some help. Two weeks ago it was packed with wounded Zairean soldiers but as the rebels approached a mortar landed on the hospital. Troops and civilian patients alike fled. People recovering from operations, with broken limbs and women close to labour, bolted. They took with them everything they could carry. The hospital was looted by its patients. In place of the stolen sheets and medicines, soldiers left their guns and uniforms. They had no intention of fighting. Kubuya Songe has appealed for stolen drugs to be returned. There has been little response.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Department of Land Affairs labour tenant rights facilitator Busani Ngubane says many labour tenant eviction cases are complicated by the involvement of a plethora of unions and organisations operating in the Vryheid area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of these unions charge people money just to introduce them to a lawyer.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others get people to sign contracts with the farmers that they are farmworkers instead of labour tenants. Some of them give bad advice and then it is too late to take legal action,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other land rights legal officials say some unions are &quot;getting rich off these poor landless people&quot;, and point to the flash cars driven by local unionists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General United Workers Union of South Africa (Guwusa) president France Phillips has a black Mercedes parked outside, unusual for a rural union official, but denies he is getting rich at the expense of labour tenants. He says he only charges R10 monthly membership dues and his competitors in the KwaZulu Union of Farm Residents Organisation (KwaZufro) and the Mining, Agricultural, Commercial and Allied Workers Union of South Africa (Macawusa) say they charge even less. They all say &quot;some other unions&quot; are the culprits, but refuse to specify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unions point the finger back at the Department of Land Affairs, which they say has failed to help their members, and at the farmers whom they accuse of employing new tactics to kick tenants off their land. &quot;The farmers are turning their farms into game reserves and telling the people, 'If you don't move, we'll bring in lions next week'. Others are turning their farms into forests which employ less people,&quot; says KwaZufro President Zakhe Mtshali.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Catholic Church will not be taking action against members of the faith who, as African National Congress MPs, voted in favour of the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Bill. But MP Jennifer Ferguson, who, while not a Catholic, abstained from voting on the Bill, could face expulsion from the ANC and the loss of her seat for breaching party discipline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC whip Geoff Doidge said Ferguson's action would be considered by the ANC's National Executive Committee. She might escape with a reprimand but could face expulsion, he said. &quot;In other Parliaments the chief whip would simply suspend an MP who did this, without even consulting the party leadership.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doidge himself is a Catholic. He said this week: &quot;I've been taught that abortion is wrong. But I am in Parliament as an ANC MP. People voted in 1994 for the ANC, not for Geoff Doidge. I'm not there as a Catholic MP, but as an ANC MP. In terms of that I must follow party discipline.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By abstaining, Ferguson defied a two-line whip. This allowed MPs who felt unable to toe the party line on the issue to be absent during the vote - but this had to be with leave of the chief whip, Doidge said. ANC MP Father Smangaliso Mkatshwa, a Catholic priest, was among about 11 ANC MPs who took advantage of this option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another ANC MP, Sister Bernard Ncube, who is a Catholic nun, did not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Catholic Church will not be excommunicating any MPs, notwithstanding a carefully worded statement issued by Archbishop Wilfrid Napier on the eve of the vote. Napier said that under canon law, &quot;all Catholics involved in a deliberate and successful attempt to bring about an abortion are automatically excommunicated&quot; for a crime against human life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His statement linked the canonical diktat to the responsibility which &quot; likewise&quot; fell on legislators who promoted and approved abortion laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people outside Parliament didn't realise the dilemma some MPs found themselves in,&quot; Doidge said. &quot;It was a very difficult time, wrestling with one's conscience and party loyalty. You opened the paper in the morning and saw you were threatened with excommunication.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His own position was made doubly difficult by his being a whip. &quot;My job is to ensure that MPs vote in favour of legislation tabled by the organisation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those who voted for the Bill will not incur excommunication,&quot; Father Emil Blaser, associate secretary general of the Southern African Catholic Bishops' Conference, said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Canonical law must be interpreted strictly. It states that anyone involved in procuring an abortion will be excommunicated - the person undergoing an abortion, the doctor performing it, the friend who assists. It says nothing about those in Parliament who helped pass a law that makes abortions possible.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the church would see the yes-votes of Catholic MPs - it estimates there are about 78 - as sinful in that they had gone against the teachings of the church. This would mean their seeking forgiveness through confession, Blaser said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ferguson, the mother of two children, said that she had acted in terms of &quot; the dictates of my heart&quot;. She had obtained a backstreet abortion aged 21 and felt &quot;at peace&quot; with this decision. While not opposed to abortion on request per se, she believed it should not be allowed beyond 12 weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her statements prompted a rebuke from fellow ANC MP Pregs Govender in an open letter published in The Cape Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You are a woman of power,&quot; Govender wrote. &quot;You have found your voice and it is heard by many people ... there are millions in this country who are not as fortunate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You were voted into Parliament by many who believed you would protect and defend their right to make their own choices (as you had done in choosing an abortion at 21 years ...).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What is your responsibility as an MP voted into a position of power and privilege in relation to the rights of women who put you there?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Govender noted the &quot;real courage&quot; of Sister Ncube, who voted for the Bill &quot; because she saw the pain and suffering caused by the lack of access to services (under present abortion law).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Her faith, conviction and compassion go beyond herself. It encompasses the need to save the lives of women and young girls who die in their hundreds every year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Her compassion gives her the courage to face the pain and ostracism that voting for this Bill will inevitably bring from the Catholic Church that she has served as a nun for so long and so faithfully. That takes real courage,&quot; Govender wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a response soon to be published, Ferguson says: &quot;The Bill has been given to the women of South Africa as a step towards our empowerment. If we, however, see abortion only as an issue of women's liberation, we have planted a seed of another cycle of oppression - one which neglects to hear that most silent voice of all, the voice of the unborn child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said there was evidence that in India most abortions were of female foetuses. &quot;Is this liberation of women? Is this what we are fighting for?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an MP, she had felt &quot;unable to reduce the complexity of the issue into a mere choice of two buttons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was searching for the third way, the one that could compassionately embrace both mother and child. I know many of my colleagues were in a similar dilemma. A neighbourly comrade held my hand and said, 'Press the yes-button, my darling, then go home and pray to God'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was unable to vote without conscience. I abstained.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Thirty five elephant in the Kruger Park have been darted from the air with sedatives, checked with an ultra-sound machine to ensure they are not pregnant, and given a hefty dose of the pachyderm pill in a novel experiment designed to test whether animal contraception can minimise the need for culling the Kruger National Park's elephant population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The experiment, funded by the Humane Society of the United States, involves research into two types of contraception. The first method, known as &quot;immuno- contraception,&quot; requires the cows to be injected with a vaccine derived from proteins harvested from pigs' ovaries. The vaccine provokes the formation of antibodies in the elephant that binds its ovaries and prevents them from being penetrated by sperm.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second method requires the cow to be immobilised so that implants of oestrogen, which work according to the same principles as the contraceptive pill used by women, can be surgically implanted into the animals. So far 25 cows have been vaccinated and another 10 implanted with the pill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aim of the experiment is to determine whether this kind of contraception works and, if so, whether it has an adverse effect on the long- term fertility and behaviour of the elephants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initial computer modelling suggests that at least 2 300 adult cows will need to be under treatment at any one time in order to stabilise the Kruger National Park populpation ... The costs involved in doing so for 2 300 elephants at this stage appears to be prohibitive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the research project is still in early experimental stages, it drew widespread criticism at the elephant policy indaba hosted by the National Parks Board this week. A number of wildlife organisations complained the project involved an extravagant expense at a time when rural people could benefit from revenues and products derived from elephants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Africa is a protein-poor continent. We're trying to grow cattle and crops.  All the world has cattle and crops! But elephants are something the world wants. They want to see them, and they want their products, and we've got them. But what do we do. We reduce productivity through contraception. It makes no sense,&quot; said Jon Hutton, project manager of the Africa Resources Trust, in an article criticising the experiment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Elephants can provide both income, through the sale of products and hunting licences, and much-needed protein for communities bordering national parks. The same economic activities can also fund the upkeep of those parks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parks board, however, insists that its relatively small experiment does not mean it has given up the right to use culling as a population control method. &quot;The current state of this technology suggests that even if contraception works in elephants, it will not be a viable option for controlling larger elephant populations,&quot; says an official statement. &quot; However, should the research show that contraception can be achieved in elephants, it will offer a useful option for limiting small populations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Anthony Hall-Martin, director of research and development for the National Parks Board, admitted at the indaba that Kruger's population could be allowed to rise as high as 25 000 if the policies of other conservationists in Africa are followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hall-Martin noted that Kruger's management had based its culling policy on observations that elephant moved into new grazing land once their herds exceeded 1,2 animals per square kilometre of rangeland. In parts of Tanzania and Zimbabwe, where ecological conditions were similar to those in Kruger, conservationists had established the terrain could support 2,7 elephants per square kilometre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Barrit, from the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said he welcomed the board's decision to review the scientific status of its policies and to open the debate on how to handle Kruger's elephants to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other animal rights groups said Hall-Martin's admission vindicated their claims that the old policy of shooting a few hundred elephants a year to keep the population of Kruger at around 7 500 had not been necessary.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The sky on the night of President Nelson Mandela's inauguration back in May 1994 was moonless and, after watching the song and dance at the Union Buildings on an old television set, I sat in a hut with Gilbert Nwaila talking by candlelight about life in his village about a kilometre from the fence of the Kruger National Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nwaila, a cattle farmer from the village of Mabiligwe in a far corner of the Northern Province, told a story of how his neighbours had been moved at gunpoint from the northern parts of what is now the Kruger Park, and he described the manifold problems which continued to affect their lives on the day of their freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is how he described the paradox: &quot;Today we have our freedom. Yet we cannot move. We feel locked in. The people of Mabiligwe had lived in a wild and beautiful part of the park for more than 100 years when government trucks and some policemen arrived in 1969 and told them to move. Some resisted by throwing stones but the community relented when the police threatened to shoot.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he spoke, a series of low bellows emanated from the cattle kraal next to his homestead. Nwaila's sons ran into the darkness where they found a heifer that had been chased and mauled by hyenas. The boys slit its throat, and as its blood seeped into the earth, Nwaila explained that in a bad month he could lose six head of cattle to predators which break out of the fence that separates his people from the park where they once lived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, more than two years after Mandela's inauguration, the representatives of thousands of people like Gilbert Nwaila made it clear that they would no longer accept a situation in which ordinary rural people, many of them the victims of removal to make way for the park, are expected to bear the new burdens of living next to one of the world's most famous game reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The occasion was a conference called by the National Parks Board this week to discuss how best to manage the elephant herds of the Kruger Park without resorting to culling - one of the most heated environmental controversies in recent times. Billed as the elephant indaba, the event turned into one of the most important challenges to this country's conservation authorities to ensure that game reserves play a meaningful role in rural development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know very much that the Kruger Park is a national asset. But we shouldn't forget that the wild animals in Kruger have a direct impact on the local people. The animals are destroying our products. The park must help to make development programmes to upgrade these neighbouring communities. We feel we must be assisted by the Kruger National Park,&quot; said Mmbengeni Musalafu, a local government councillor for three villages adjoining the park's northern boundary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'What the communities want is some involvement in the management of the park because their voice is not being heard. The National Parks Board seems to be representing animals only because at the end of the day the people's voice is not being heard,&quot; added Joseph Ngwenya, member of the transitional local council for the Bushbuckridge area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The councillors were part of a delegation representing villages along the entire western border of the Kruger Park which attended the conference to make the very basic point that, although the South African public had a right to discuss what went on inside the national park, the needs of people who used to live there and whose livelihoods were most affected had to be given priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Elvis Madhlope, vice chair of the Bushbuckridge Environmental Forum, emphasised lions which preyed on people's livestock or marauding elephants trampling people's crops were only the most dramatic issue the delegation wanted to deal with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Historically people lived there, he said. &quot;But ever since the Kruger National Park was established we have never seen what that place can do for the community. No classrooms or businesses like people being able to sell their crafts in there. Take even this elephant issue. We hear about the selling of ivory in the past but we never knew what happened to it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A set of resolutions, adopted earlier this month at a workshop attended by more than 100 people from many of the villages bordering the park, insisted that mechanisms or an institution must be created to ensure effective community participation in and benefit from the management of the Kruger National Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of speakers at this week's conference added that the new board of trustees, appointed last year by the Cabinet to oversee the work of the parks board, was not creating this opportunity. &quot;We are not really challenging the legitimacy of this new board of trustees. But we are challenging the effectiveness of their job. Many issues need their attention but have not yet been addressed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the rural delegation said they were disturbed to hear about the public conference to discuss how best to manage the population of Kruger's elephants in the press - even though the park's management had set up four forums in regions adjoining the park to liaise with neighbouring communities about conservation issues that affected them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The parks board made no plans to take the process to communities,&quot; said Unjinee Poonan of the Group for Environmental Monitoring (Gem), the organisation that arranged the community workshop and delegation. &quot;The National Parks Board didn't even take the policy discussion document to its own community forums.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A list of resolutions presented by the rural delegation stated that specific needs of the neighbouring communities that must be addressed through a change in the management policy of the Kruger National Park included:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Compensation for damages suffered by problem animals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Access to natural and cultural resources in the park. The former includes firewood, water and thatching but also ... the right to harvest wildlife through hunting. The latter includes the right of access to visit sites of cultural importance such as ancestral graves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Business partnerships based on tourism and related activities to do with the existence of the park. This would be one of the most effective ways to redistribute the benefits and revenues generated by Kruger's existence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Environmental education to remedy past exclusion of black people from exposure to game reserves and the kind of conservation values that they generate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Contributions from revenues generated by the park to infrastructural development such as the provision of water, electricity, housing and clinics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Julian Sturgeon, from the Africa Resources Trust (Art), pointed out that the communities demands were modest and responsible. They respected the park's integrity and did not want to take over the reserve so that it could be used for farming or other economic activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sturgeon added it was a priority for the parks board - along with other government agencies such as provincial governments, the Department of Land Affairs and the Department of Environment Affairs and Tourism - to ensure that effective programmes were created on the borders of Kruger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gilbert Nwaila may not have realised it when his heifer was killed by hyenas in Mabiligwe more than two years ago, but the event that took place earlier that day - the inauguration of a new government which has given effective power to ordinary people in far-flung parts of the country - has ensured that people and their needs can no longer be ignored by the country's conservation authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And this, rather than issues relating to the complex question of whether to cull or not to cull elephants, was the basic message from the parks board's indaba this week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Walter Ndlovu, a census representative for Mpumalanga, some farmers blocked enumerators from entering their farms. &quot;The reason is purely political - many of them are racist,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the North-West, farmers claimed to be busy ploughing and thus unable to allow enumerators on to farms. Census officials in the region believed this was only an excuse to deny them access: &quot;Farmers don't want to let people know under what trying conditions labourers work,&quot; one official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The enumeration period ended on October 31 but regional offices contacted this week said they needed more time to get to inaccessible areas. They expected to complete the count by the end of November. Most provinces said they had already counted more than 90% of their people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Western Cape more than 92% of the population has been counted. &quot;The slowest area so far is the Boland due to the huge distances between farms and all the rain,&quot; said Shahieda Hendricks, a Cape census representative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hendricks said people in Khayalitsha had refused to fill in the Xhosa questionnaire because it was badly translated. &quot;We then had to get more English questionnaires, which they were happy to answer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counting has been especially slow in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal. In Gauteng, there were too few enumerators. Difficulties were also experienced gaining access to property with security fences and aggressive dogs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A random sample shows, too, that census officials have not always been quick to collect completed forms. A resident of Parkview, Johannesburg, said his form had not been collected despite numerous calls to the local census office. &quot;I was told to leave it in the letter box after I had filled it in,&quot; he said. When the form was still not collected a census official told him: &quot; We are not here to sort out problems of collection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Enumerators in KwaZulu-Natal said fighting had created difficulties. &quot;In many areas where there was faction-fighting we were accompanied by the police.  We had to count the people and once we were finished they could continue fighting,&quot; said KwaZulu-Natal census representative Agrippa Ngcobo.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It took the Irish ambassador to jog the South African government into realising it needed to ease up on its immigration rules to allow foreign investors, and foreign government-sponsored consultants into the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Eamon O'Toole, after consultations with other European ambassadors over problems with the Department of Home Affairs, made a number of high-level representations to the departments of Foreign Affairs and Home Affairs earlier this year to try and smooth the passage of foreign citizens who wished to work in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Toole said he had responded to a call for help from an Irish citizen who was battling to get a work permit to work in a company in Cape Town, which is a subsidiary of an Irish firm and employs about 13 South Africans.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I discussed this with my European colleagues and found that the problem was quite widespread. Then I discussed it with everybody I could find, including the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Aziz Pahad. I wrote a letter to the Minister of Home Affairs, Mangosuthu Buthelezi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems that things have improved because of these discussions. South Africa has its own rules, I understand, but you need foreign investment for employment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks to the ambassador's intervention, Home Affairs now automatically gives two- year work permits to Europeans who are coming to South Africa to work in European- based subsidiary companies. Their spouses and children automatically get permits as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while that may be a giant leap forward for Home Affairs, South Africa's image abroad was tarnished this week by media reports that a high-level consultant, appointed by the German government's Credit Institute for Reconstruction, had had difficulties getting the right papers to stay in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home Affairs originally did not want to provide the consultant, James Hokens, with a work permit because he did not have a German service pass or a diplomatic passport. The German embassy could not give him either because he was an American national.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The matter is being resolved,&quot; said Hokens from Johannesburg this week. &quot; The Department of Housing has been negotiating with the minster of home affairs to sort this out and I have now got an exemption. It was just a pain because I could not open a bank account and had no legal standing when I arrived. It also hampered the development of the project.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hokens is the chief technical advisor to the Rural Housing Loan Fund through which a sum of 50-million Deutschmarks is being channeled for housing.  He said negotiations between the two governments were reaching a conclusion, and &quot;great progress had been made&quot;, despite the negative reports from Bonn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hokens, who worked in Namibia after independence, said South Africa would eventually realise the need to co-ordinate the departments of Foreign Affairs, Finance and Home Affairs in order to facilitate investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It took Namibia four years to realise the need for co-ordination across ministries and eventually they set up a planning commission in the Finance Ministry to work this out. Once South Africa does the same people will find it easy to invest. The problems encountered now are a reflection of a country just emerging into the global economy. There is a need for some flexibility and understanding by government ministries, otherwise people can be very legalistic and unconstructive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the German embassy's Jutte Wolke, things improved after the Irish ambassador made representations to the South African government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were able to bring in a brass band earlier this year without them having to have work permits so we are seeing an improvement in our cultural exchanges.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - KwaZulu-Natal attorney general Tim McNally has again come under fire from the Investigation Task Unit (ITU)probing hit- squads in the province after he declined to prosecute the third hit squad-related case brought before him since the October acquittal of former defence minister Magnus Malan and 19 others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ITU's civilian board convenor Howard Varney said he saw &quot;little prospect of organised political violence being exposed and stopped through the administration of justice&quot; after McNally this week refused to prosecute former KwaZulu Police (KZP) commissioner Lietenant-General Roy During and two senior KwaZulu government officials in connection with an illegal arms cache uncovered in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week McNally declined to prosecute former KZP deputy commissioner Brigadier Sipho Mathe in connection with allegations he issued a false police appointment certificate to a Caprivi- trained hit-man who had admitted to committing 24 murders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late last month McNally also declined to prosecute several senior IFP officials including provincial MPs on hit squad charges emanating from the 1995 trial of the Esikhawini hit squad. Varney said the cache referred to in the case investigated against During - comprising a light machine gun (LMG), a spare barrel and a large quantity of ammunition - was uncovered in a basement storeroom of the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly by a building manager in September 1993.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During arrived to investigate but, according to his own admission, stopped the investigation on the instruction of then KwaZulu chief minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi's admnistrative secretary Stan Armstrong who he claimed was his &quot;superior&quot;: &quot;According to During, Armstrong claimed that the weapon and ammunition was under the control of Robert Mzimela, then secretary of the KwaZulu government. Neither Armstrong nor Mzimela supplied During with an explanation,&quot; said Varney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ITU investigated charges of defeating the ends of justice against During for his role in stopping the investigation, and charges of unauthorised possession of arms and ammunition against Armstrong and Mzimela, both of whom continue to enjoy similar senior positions under the KwaZulu- Natal Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McNally confirmed his decision not to prosecute in the case but said this decision was taken by a member of his staff. Explaining the decision, McNally said: &quot;The memorandum drawn up by the ITU and which acompanied the docket indicates a lack of confidence in the case. It stated that 'there does appear to be insufficient evidence against either Armstrong or Mzimela to make their prosecution on this case viable'. General During is described in the memorandum as 'a relative innocent in the affair' ... The charge of allegedly defeating the ends of justice appears to have been something of an afterthought,&quot; McNally said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Varney said the most serious charges were those against Armstrong and Mzimela, but agreed the evidence was &quot;not that strong&quot;. Denying the charge investigated against During was an afterthought, Varney said the ITU had requested his prosecution by letter: &quot;A strong prima facie case of defeating the ends of justice existed against General During. We should not have to explain to an experienced attorney general the seriousness of a police commissioner defeating the ends of justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McNally's office said, however, that there was &quot;no evidence to suggest During ... (was) defeating or obstructing the course of justice. In fact During set in motion the investigation regarding the (weapons) ... The explanation of During that he recieved instructions from Armstrong must be accepted&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Varney countered that McNally's &quot;assessment of the facts makes little sense.  On During's own version he admitted to stopping a police investigation into the possession of a highly lethal weapon which has since vanished ... During was the chief of police. Armstrong was not During's superior,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Varney added that the ITU regarded the case as &quot;extremely serious&quot;, especially in light of evidence led in the trial of Vlakplass commander Eugene de Kock that substantial weaponry from the SADF's operations in Namibia was illegally procured, some of which were handed over to IFP functionaries in Ulundi: &quot;It appears that light machine guns were amongst (these weapons),&quot; said Varney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McNally said &quot;there is nothing in the papers available to me to suggest any link between the machine gun in question and Eugene de Kock&quot;. McNally added that &quot;Varney is an attorney who is employed by the Department of Safety and Security as the convenor of the ITB. His role is that of an investigator. So far as I am aware, he has no experience as a prosecutor. It is his function to oversee the investigations of his unit. It is the function of the attorney general and members of his staff to make decisions as to whether to prosecute or not.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The man who lifted the veil of secrecy once shrouding Inkatha Freedom Party-aligned hit- squads in KwaZulu-Natal launched a scathing attack this week on the prosecuting team who kept him silent during the Magnus Malan trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Caprivi political commissar Daluxolo Luthuli spoke to the Mail &amp; Guardian this week in his first interview since the &quot;trial of the decade&quot; - the bloodstained province's biggest third force trial - ended in acquittal in the Durban Supreme Court last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luthuli - who has been referred to as Chief Albert Luthuli's grandson, though he is only distantly related to the late African National Congress leader - said that from the beginning of the prosecution he had feared the murder conspiracy trial against former defence minister Malan and 19 other apartheid-era securocrats and IFP members would not succeed because of the failure to call witnesses like him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From the beginning (the state) was supposed to prove the existence of the Caprivis, how they were organised and who was responsible ... When people like myself were not called, how were they supposed to prove how this paramilitary wing was created?&quot; he asked.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of 73 potential witnesses listed by the state at the beginning of the trial, Luthuli is convinced his testimony could have bolstered the state's case: &quot;There are a lot of things I could have added to that trial,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presiding Judge Jan Hugo went even further than that: he referred to Luthuli as the &quot;fons et origio&quot; - the origin - of the whole investigation.  Luthuli said he had expected to testify about the purpose of the 1986 Military Intelligence training of 206 IFP recruits in the Caprivi strip, as well as the selection procedures for specialised training and the meaning of key terms and phrases on which the state's case ultimately fell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I understand the case was running around the word 'offensive'. Nobody gave a correct interpretation,&quot; he said. &quot;I was supposed to be there to interpret those words 'offensive', 'defensive', so you know that if a defensive group has served and left the area, there must be an offensive group following in their footsteps.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state alleged members of the defensive group of Caprivi trainees had collected intelligence on four potential targets, after which 10 members of the 30-man offensive group had carried out the 1987 KwaMakhutha massacre at the centre of the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judge Hugo accepted that offensive group members had carried out the attack, but ruled that their training could not be construed according to the primary meaning of the term &quot;offensive&quot;, which is &quot;to attack&quot;. Hugo accepted expert defence testimony that the term had an innocent or &quot;defensive&quot; meaning when used in a military context.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luthuli led the investigation task unit to the state's star witness, Johann Opperman, but says he now fears KwaZulu-Natal attorney general Tim McNally may have jeopardised his own testimony in future cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rejecting &quot;that stupid quote (of McNally's) that I am an unreliable witness&quot; , Luthuli said he feared such a statement from the prosecutor could be used to discredit his testimony in other cases which are still pending: &quot;It was up to the judge to say I was unreliable and then for McNally to charge me,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Luthuli had been involved in hundreds of incidents over several years McNally told the court he had not called Luthuli as he was an &quot; unreliable&quot; witness who had incorrectly stated that the KwaMakhutha massacre was a revenge attack for the death of a man who actually died six months later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luthuli countered that McNally had previously called him to testify against self-confessed Esikhawini hit-squad members Romeo Mbambo, Gcina Mkhize and Israel Hlongwane &quot;when I didn't want to be against them. I was the one who convinced them it was high time they told the truth. I wasn't even consulted or told I was going to give evidence against them,&quot; he claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state called Luthuli in an unsuccessful endeavour to counter claims in mitigation by Mbambo and his co-accused in 1995 that they had acted under orders from senior members of the IFP and KwaZulu government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Convinced the state's three accomplice witnesses in the Malan trial - former Military Intelligence officer Johann Opperman, Andr' Cloete and Caprivi trainee Alex Khumalo - were essentially telling the truth, despite the court's refusal to indemnify them, Luthuli says he is frustrated at the state's failure to secure convictions because the Caprivi men &quot;were not recruited or trained as policemen, yet they were given police appoinment cards. They have been involved in many massacres since KwaMakhutha (and) Military Intelligence were deeply involved. The Caprivis were their brainchild and if there were no Caprivis the violence would not be the way it is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luthuli admitted the aqcuittal of the Malan 20 had increased his personal fears, &quot;because they all know who is responsible for them being accused as perpetrators of violence&quot;, but said he did not regret his 1994 decision to turn state's evidence because the truth had &quot;relieved&quot; him: &quot;I feel more free now than ever before,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luthuli said he looks forward to testifying before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. &quot;That is the place where I will open my heart.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Several senior military men, including former Civilian Co- operation Bureau (CCB) operatives, will receive subpoenas in the next three weeks ordering them to appear before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While most former policemen implicated in &quot;dirty tricks&quot; operations are busy preparing submissions in pursuit of indemnity from prosecution, few members of the former South African Defence Force (SADF)have so far decided to voluntarily spill the beans.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the truth commission is preparing about a dozen subpoenas to serve on men such as former military intelligence chief General Joffel van der Westhuizen; Eddie Webb, former chairman of the CCB; Joe Verster, its former managing director; and other office- bearers in the SADF's secret organisation. Verster and his colleagues were paid off shortly after the CCB was disbanded six years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among them were several Angolans who had previously worked for the SADF's special forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While little is known about the CCB operations outside South Africa, its internal operatives - mostly former policemen - are also going to be subpoenaed, among them convicted murderer Ferdie Barnard, &quot;Staal&quot; Burger, &quot; Slang&quot; van Zyl, &quot;Calla&quot; Barnard and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of senior special forces operatives are also on the truth commission's list, as are others who served both military and army intelligence and who may need to seek indemnity from prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subpoenas will be issued prior to the cut-off date of mid-December for voluntary applications for amnesty. The truth commission, however, will continue to subpoena more former SADF members next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission is about to be swamped with applications for amnesty from policemen before the cut-off date for voluntary applications</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Transvaal attorney general has hundreds of cases under investigation for prosecution, and at least one major trial will get under way before the courts close, also in mid-December.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I myself was appalled and felt a sense of outrage at the way in which the matter was handled. The perception created was clearly one which reflected badly on the criminal justice system,&quot; stated the minister in his strongly worded letter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He expressed deep regret at the casual way in which the case against Allan Stokes - a local sailor charged with the murder - was handled. &quot;I believe that an apology is due to the family. Insofar as I am the minister in overall charge of justice, I do indeed record my apology.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Govender, a former ANC national organiser and a rising star in the new civil service, died on November 10 last year after he had boarded a catamaran owned by Stokes during a picnic with colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to fellow trainee Jacqueline Coetzer, she and Govender had boarded the seemingly deserted catamaran to investigate loud noise coming from a radio. Stokes told police the couple broke into the vessel and looted his provisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spotting them from the shore, Stokes raced to confront them in a motorised dinghy, allegedly armed with a machete. Govender died in the ensuing m l'e.  His body was later recovered from the dam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Coetzer reached the shore she found Stokes chatting amicably with two policemen who tried to arrest her. No apparent attempt was made to find Govender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stokes was only charged with murder nearly four weeks later and only after a public outcry from his family and the ANC. He was given unconditional bail and allowed to leave the country to take part in the Cape to Rio yacht race.  His trial is due to start next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omar said the preception created was that the authorities had &quot;bent over backwards to accommodate the accused&quot;. The fact that he was not immediately arrested and locked up creates &quot;a very strong suspicion of a friendly relationship with the police&quot;, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Govender's fianc'e Roslyn Perkins, a British citizen living in London, says she is concerned the forthcoming trial is taking place in the regional court.  &quot;We wanted it held in the Supreme Court and are not happy with the reasons given against this,&quot; she complained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omar has written to Free State Attorney General Muller van der Merwe expressing his dissatisfaction with the department. The minister received a reply which he described as &quot;totally insensitive and inappropriate&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jo Hiemstra, deputy attorney general of the Free State, refused to comment on the row except to say: &quot;The attorney general has made his views known to the minister and as this is an internal matter will be issuing no public statement.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - During winter months the joints in Percy Stellenberg's jaw become stiff and sore as if in need of oiling. Come summer time the right side of his face is distorted by massive swelling, and pain continues to be a feature of his daily life. In any season his sense of smell is confused by the aroma of blood, which when he blows his nose escapes into his hankie blackened and congealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giving evidence at the West Rand Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearing this week, Stellenberg (40) told how his once handsome face was rebuilt with metal parts after it was ripped open &quot;like the page of a book&quot;, when a uniformed policeman deliberately fired a rubber bullet at pointblank range in 1990.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stellenberg, who now has two stainless steel plates in place of cheekbones and his jaw held together by metal bolts, explained that the shooting took place as he remonstrated with police who had shot and killed a youth in the former coloured township of Toekomrus then casually drove a Casspir armoured vehicle over the body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His tale was one more item in a litany of callous acts of violence which continue to be unravelled by TRC hearings as they travel the length and breadth of the country. They show that even in post-apartheid South Africa, police and security personnel continued human rights violations which impacted on the lives of ordinary citizens with no political affiliations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Toekomrus, a sparse-looking township tucked away on flat and barren gold mine territory outside Randfontein, was a peaceful community until the white town council voted to inflate rental charges six years ago. Local people refused to pay and petitioned against the increase (on average from R180 to R220 per month) claiming elderly residents would be hardest hit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 18 the protest reached fever pitch after electricity was abruptly switched off in the township. There was talk of organised civil disturbance and workers were forced to stay home because taxi drivers went on strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the year Nelson Mandela had been released from prison, but the euphoria of his walk to freedom was already ebbing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unable to get transport to his job as a machine turner at an engineering firm in Booysens, Johannesburg, Stellenberg spent the day at his cousin's house before walking home with friends. It was about 3pm when the small group ambled along Diamond Street. Along the way they heard rumours that a teenage boy had been killed by police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within minutes rumour became reality when they came upon the body surrounded by an angry group of young men, police and military personnel.  Stellenberg says he approached the Casspir and asked its occupants to leave the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pleaded to no avail for about 10 minutes. Then without warning one white policeman wearing sunglasses climbed out on top of the vehicle, pulled his revolver and fired down on Stellenberg. &quot;I heard a bang, felt searing pain and then only remember waking up in hospital in deep pain.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His wife did not even recognise him when she saw his wounds. The bullet had split open his right nostril, parting open his top lip, shattering bone and teeth before exiting through his lower jaw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wires were used to fuse his bones together in the first operation, the second and third saw the installation of steel plates and screws. A year later cartilage was removed from his ribcage to rebuild his collapsed right nasal passage, allowing him to breathe normally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assault has left him a shadow of the gregarious men he used to be, carrying both psychological and physical scars. He was unable to work for 10 weeks. &quot;I'm still not 100% but fortunately my hands can still operate machinery. But at times I have bad dreams and I no longer socialise the way I used to because people stare at me, some of them think I'm a gangster or something,'' he says. &quot;I also lost all my teeth and now have to wear dentures which is very upsetting.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stellenberg told the TRC he did not lay charges against the police because he heard he would be arrested, but he now wanted an investigation to find out who had made the cowardly attack on him. &quot;I'm sure he is able to sleep peacefully in his bed like so many of those who say they were only defending the state from terrorists,'' he says. &quot;But I would like to see his face and show him what he did to mine.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Smith, a friend and neighbour, was the other Toekomrus resident to tell his story about police behaviour on that fateful day. He spent 11 days in Garden City Clinic after his body and face were peppered with birdshot and rubber bullets - one piercing his lungs - in a separate incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith had tried to return to his home and family on the day of the shooting, after hearing unrest had broken out in the area. &quot;The boss let us leave early and I wanted to go and protect my property,'' he says. But on arriving at the township he found roads blocked by Casspirs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I could not get past the blockade and had to take another route.'' He ended up at a friends house and waited. After about an hour they heard gunshots and screaming. &quot;We went to investigate and heard that Jones Khamu, a local youth, had been killed.'' As they approached the scene shots rang out and Smith fell wounded. &quot;I don't know whether it was the police or soldiers who fired but it was clear that I was unarmed when they did.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith (43) had worked hard for nearly 20 years to achieve a senior position in an engineering company, but lost the job because the injuries stopped him going to work until the following year. For 17 months he even had to pay his own medical bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I couldn't continue my welding work because I got a searing pain in my eyes. I still have a pellet embedded in my head which the surgeons said they could not remove.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Smith told the TRC that his biggest regret was that because of the shooting he could not afford to send his oldest son to university the following year. &quot; We had great plans for him to go into law and today he has just an ordinary job.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Mismanagement and racism turned what could have been a quiet, early censure into a spectacular, politically embarrassing downfall, say former colleagues of sacked Transnet executive Sipho Nyawo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Little else, they claim, can explain the events that led to Nyawo's dismissal last week - an action that damaged the credibility of Transnet and that of its shareholder, the public enterprises ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyawo, formerly chief executive of Portnet, racked up 181 alleged abuses of his company credit card between February 1994 and last December. No one, it seems, chastised him for doing what he should not have been doing and the practices went on unchecked.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only when Nyawo's promotion to head Portnet beckoned were the details - a weighty, official-looking &quot;charge sheet&quot; - leaked to the media</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Transnet board and minister Stella Sigcau decided in July to appoint Nyawo anyway, deciding that the claims at that stage were &quot;mere allegations&quot;, a spokesman says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four months later, last week, Nyawo was fired, after 65 of the charges were validated in an investigation ordered by Sicgau and carried out by retired judge John Trengove. The charges - worth around R50 000 - include unauthorised ATM withdrawals, paying for first-class plane tickets, fast food and gynaecological bills for a third party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyawo is now taking court action against the parastatal and Sigcau, and they are considering bringing criminal charges against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sigcau's office, determined that it act correctly throughout, says the allegations at the time of Nyawo's appointment were unproven. The claims might have been floating around since the end of 1995, but Nyawo had always denied them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transnet chairman Louise Tager agrees, but goes further. &quot;We had to walk a narrow path between rumours and allegations against him on the one side and racism and victimisation against black management on the other,&quot; she says.  She also says Transnet does not know who drew up the 181 allegations against Nyawo. &quot;We imagine it was a group of people. We can't tell where it came from.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This statement surprised several of Tager's colleagues. Human resources director Joe Ndhlela, called in for the initial investigation in February, found the allegations had been compiled by Nyawo's superiors at Portnet - including port management chief executive Neil Oosthuizen and port operation chief executive Philip Venter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndhlela found it puzzling that the charges had not been dealt with as they occurred - credit card spending is supposed to be reconciled every month.  Instead the irregularities had been allowed to build up, dating back to the month after Nyawo joined Transnet as planning and development manager at the Port of Durban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oosthuizen and Venter have now moved on, but most of the other managers are still there. For the past four months they should have been answering to Nyawo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndhlela, mindful of Nyawo's legal action, is reluctant to comment. Other senior staff, however, are less reticent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This has been a study in management inefficiency, for both the new and the old management,&quot; one source says. &quot;Why should these managers have let these abuses accumulate for so long and then for us to read about it first in the press? There was an issue of racism in that people were not implementing procedures in an even-handed manner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his report, Trengove found that Nyawo &quot;rendered valuable services in connection with the transformation of Portnet, often under difficult circumstances&quot;. These &quot;difficult circumstances&quot; will have included Nyawo coming up against Portnet management - viewed as a bastion of the old order, stuffed with white Afrikaans males who spend much of their time looking out for each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African Railway and Harbour Workers' Union has previously claimed that conservatism within Portnet is central to attempts to &quot;destabilise and polarise the workforce under black management. It is obvious the objective is also to embarrass transformation processes, eliminate those responsible for transforming Transnet and destabilise the black empowerment agenda,&quot; the union said last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Described by Tager as knowledgeable and intelligent - &quot;his abilities were never questioned&quot; - Nyawo began attracting critical media attention as the seat on the Transnet board drew closer. Most of the critical stories surfaced first in the Afrikaans press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the credit card allegations, questions were raised about Nyawo's doctorate and his links with the Strategic Planning Institute - an organisation he helped found which counted Portnet as a major customer. The latter story appeared on the day Nyawo was suspended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such attention has not been concentrated solely on Nyawo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the Afrikaans press which also broke the first stories concerning pay for the new Transnet board. Such coverage missed the far larger package former managing director Anton Moolman commanded - a guaranteed R1- million a year - until Sigcau revealed it in Parliament last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyawo, however, also did himself few favours. His repeated denials of every allegation failed to convince those he might have counted as allies. The numbers involved also jarred. The parastatal once operated 4 000 credit cards for management. Nyawo notched up 65 proven infringements in 22 months; among the 3 999 other card users, another investigation uncovered only 121 cases over 14 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June, one month before his appointment to the board, Nyawo and other alleged card abusers were offered amnesty by Transnet - four weeks to repay what they had taken from the company, with no further reprisal. None of them took up the offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tager is determined to draw a line under the affair, saying the process, &quot; long and painful&quot;, is now over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyawo thinks otherwise. And the door has been left open to his legal action by an apparent botch-up by Transnet in handling his dismissal. Trengove did recommend that Nyawo be dismissed - &quot;the picture is one of disregard of the rules and practices which Nyawo as a manager should have operated&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he also says Nyawo had not personally gained from the transgressions, that Nyawo had undertaken to repay any loss Transnet might have sustained, and that the transgressions &quot;occurred in circumstances of equally appalling and even greater laxity&quot;. He recommended that his report be considered by the Transnet board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Transnet board did not see the report before the dismissal, and still hasn't. The decision was made by Sigcau after discussions with Tager. &quot;That was only a recommendation,&quot; Tager says. &quot;The report is a very thick document.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Apparently faked documents saying that Zambian President Frederick Chiluba's wife visited South Africa for drugs treatment adds to a litany of irregularities as the Zambian election race enters its final stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian was provided this week with immigration computer printouts, and what appears to be first lady Vera Chiluba's account details at Johannesburg's upmarket Riverfield Clinic, indicating she had received treatment for &quot;substance dependency&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the supposed referring doctor, Mark Oliver, this week denied ever treating Chiluba, while Riverfield said it had reconstructed what had been an elaborate hoax.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Riverfield manager Lyn Dick said they first became aware of the slur when it was posted on the Internet last week. She said it followed inquiries by a former patient into &quot;where and for how long Vera had been here&quot;. When he was denied any information, he asked for a copy of his own account - which could have formed the basis for a doctored version implicating Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dick said the clinic had &quot;no records&quot; of Chiluba receiving treatment and that she had made a sworn affidavit to the Zambian High Commission saying Chiluba had not been at Riverfield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allegations of irregularities in the run-up to next week's presidential and parliamentary elections include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* President Chiluba and government ministers are using government vehicles and aeroplanes in their campaign travels. Chiluba has defended himself by saying that &quot;anywhere you go in the world, it's the same practice. The incumbent uses state facilities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Chiluba has been making donations to schools and orphanages from what he calls a Presidential Fund. More than 10 schools and five orphanages have each received R90 000. Chiluba said: &quot;I am empowered to use funds in the presidential coffers to help the poor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In some constituencies, Chiluba has given his party's candidates up to R400 000 each to woo voters with last-minute renovations to dilapidated schools and church buildings. Foreign Affairs Minister Christon Tembo, who is standing in a large constituency south of Lusaka, openly assured Chiluba of votes after making donations in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Coverage of the election campaign in the public media, which forms 90% of the media, has been biased against the opposition parties. National radio and television stations have been airing campaign meetings and rallies of the Movement for Multiparty Democracy. Opposition leaders are given little, or distorted, coverage. Ben Kangwa, controller of Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC) television, was recently suspended for allowing the airing of a political advertisement from Kenneth Kaunda's United National Independence Party (UNIP). It was a paid advertisement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The voters' registers are deeply flawed. Monitoring groups have found they contain more than 100 000 &quot;ghost&quot; voters. Some names appear more than three times in different areas. Nikuv, an Israeli computer firm which conducted the registration of voters, has admitted to the errors. Manager Gershom Korda said: &quot;We are looking into that urgently.&quot; But strangely, Justice Bobby Bwalya, chairman of the Electoral Commission of Zambia (ECZ), has denied the existence of ghost voters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Leaked details from an unpublished United Nations report confirm the role of Willem &quot;Ters&quot; Ehlers - former president PW Botha's last private secretary - in the arms build-up in war-racked Central Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recently completed third report of the UN commission investigating embargo-busting arms sales to Rwanda's defeated Hutu forces contains an admission by Ehlers that he was involved in a June 1994 arms consignment from the Seychelles to Goma, a Zairean provincial capital bordering Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ehlers told the commission he had been under the impression the 80 tons of rifles, grenades and ammunition, worth well over R1- million, was destined for the Zairean armed forces, which would not have contravened the UN embargo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Washington-based Human Rights Watch Arms Project, whose earlier revelations of the illicit arms flow to the region sparked the UN inquiry, this week called on the UN to release the report publicly. Said Arms Project director Joost Hiltermann: &quot;Suppressing this essential report on the role of arms trafficking in Cental Africa at exactly the moment when the region is going up in flames suggests that the Security Council is less interested in promoting international security than it is in covering its own failures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation said the unpublished UN report, dated October 28, concludes that &quot;arms have continued to flow from or through South Africa, Angola, Eastern Europe and the former Yugoslavia, and Kinshasa, Zaire&quot;. The Arms Project said the international community had &quot;enlarged&quot; the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis in the region by &quot;supplying arms to, or failing to impede the rearming of, the perpetrators of the 1994 (Rwanda) genocide&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exerpts of the UN report obtained by the Mail &amp; Guardian repeat the finding that Ehlers, once seen as a likely future chief of the South African Navy but seconded to Botha's office until Botha retired in 1989, was a broker in the arms consignment which appears to have ended up with the defeated Rwandan Hutu forces when they fled to Goma and other parts of eastern Zaire in mid- 1994. These forces have been held responsible for the massacre of up to a million Rwandan Tutsis and Hutu moderates in the first half of 1994, and have again been central to the latest conflict in Eastern Zaire, where Goma has been a flashpoint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report says the UN commission interviewed Ehlers in Pretoria in September, where he corroborated earlier evidence gathered by the commission.  But he told the commission he had believed the client had been the Zairean government, as the client's representatives had been two Zaireans. The report pointed out, however, that the one, Jean-Bosco Ruhorahoza, described himself first as Rwandan, and later as Zairean, in Seychelles immigration papers. It also pointed out that another member of the party which inspected the arms in the Seychelles with Ehlers before it was flown to Goma was Rwandan Colonel Theoneste Bagasore, who has since been arrested in Cameroon in connection with his alleged role in the genocide. Bagasore pretended in some documentation to be a Zairean functionary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission's second report, published in March 1996, appeared critical of the South African government for initially not having replied to requests for information on Ehlers and other apparent violations of the embargo implicating South Africa. But the latest report says the commission's &quot; various interlocutors&quot; had told it that South Africa's arms industry was &quot; being brought under increasing government control. However, individuals who had been involved in the arms trade or the armed forces during the apartheid era were still active in an individual capacity or in private industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - President Nelson Mandela's weekend statement to his party's National Executive Committee (NEC) was less a reflection on Thabo Mbeki's chances to be his political heir than a lifting of the lid on a carefully managed process to find the next deputy president - and eventually Mbeki's successor as president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian learned from a well-placed government official this week that Mandela recently called in Mbeki and then Jacob Zuma, the man many see as the African National Congress's and the country's deputy president under Mbeki, to tell them an alternative candidate to Zuma - someone not seen to be as close to Mbeki - should be found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela's pre-emptive action to avoid a divisive race for the second highest office in the party next year when he retires as ANC president, and in the country when he leaves office in 1999, corroborates the view that Mandela's statement to the ANC NEC, that he had not &quot;anointed&quot; Mbeki as it was a decision for party structures, was above all a statement reasserting the primacy of the party. It may have been a subtle warning to, among others, those who might have thought their political futures depended on the fortunes of Mbeki.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela's representative Parks Mankahlana said it was wrong to see the statement as a withdrawal of support. &quot;Madiba's main worry has been that he doesn't want Thabo to be seen (in a leadership position) by his grace, as Thabo's authority would then be questionable. Thabo must be seen to be riding to the presidency on his own.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government official said: &quot;Some time ago Mandela called in Mbeki and said, 'Let's deal with the issue of the deputy presidency. I don't want it to be someone close to you, because - although it's untrue - there is this image that people get hired or fired because they are close to you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official said Mbeki agreed there was an &quot;image problem&quot; and that a process to canvass ANC structures for an independent candidate - and young enough so that he or she could be groomed to take over from Mbeki after he had served &quot;one or two terms&quot; as president - could be identified. Zuma, who has been very close to Mbeki during their shared years in exile, was disqualified on both counts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela then called in Zuma, breaking the news to him. Mandela suggested outgoing ANC secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa as a candidate, but did not pursue it when &quot;everyone said, 'No, he's out or on his way out.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official said another name was &quot;given to&quot; Mandela after more consultation. He did not say who it was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramaphosa, the man who was until earlier this year seen as the main challenger to Mbeki himself, was reluctant to talk directly about Mandela's NEC statement this week, but sketched the context like this: &quot;Mandela was asserting the centrality of the ANC again, submerging himself and other personalities to the ANC ... He was emphasising the importance of the organisations above the individual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a central thread that runs through all the developments within the ANC this year - through Rocky Malebane-Metsing, through Bantu, through Winnie ... The ANC is reasserting itself as an organisation ... and it feels good to be in that type of ANC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramaphosa spoke as if perhaps it was not so good, at one point after 1994, to be in the ANC. Earlier reports told of a feeling that the ANC lost some of its soul and spirit under the pressures of its new role in government. At the time South African Communist Party veteran and NEC member Jeremy Cronin was one of the few to say publicly that the party needed resuscitation and that the government, with its operators, bureaucrats and consultants, was setting the agenda, not Shell House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cronin this week said the party was back on its feet. &quot;Two major position papers have emerged and they are very much ANC papers, with a fair amount of political stocktaking, rather than governmental and technical reviews ... The party is returning to strategic political and programmatic discussions ...  Mandela was reaffirming collective leadership and saying that nobody, including the president, was above the party structures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This would please Cronin, who does not have a position in government; it would please Ramaphosa, who has been alienated from government and is unlikely to return; and it would please Mandela himself, who is taking stock and wanting to leave as his legacy a united party, free from leadership divisions and faction fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is just as well Mandela has made the statement now, as he has recently been clumsy in the way he positioned himself in relation to key appointments.  His open support for new Chief Justice Ishmail Mohamed, for example, was controversial because it appeared to be undermining the appointment procedure.  Similarly his easy devolution of responsibilities to Mbeki was beginning to be viewed by some commentators in the same light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mankahlana this week denied there were any serious divisions in the ANC, but acknowledged there was a problem surrounding the perception of factions backing different candidates for leadership positions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The international tourism and manufacturing mega-production Dolphin Group, apparently a Saudi Arabia-based corporation, has pledged direct cash investments in excess of R6- billion to the Mpumalanga provincial government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although government officials declined to go on the record and confirm the pledge this week, sources report that the group intends to either buy or launch developments in various parts of the province totalling at least R6,3- billion during the first phase of a multi-sector investment drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provincial legislature documents in the possession of African Eye News indicate the pledged investment will be phased in over a six-year period and spread over various sectors of the regional economy, including tourism, manufacturing and a plant to service the motor industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A large portion of the proposed initial investment will be in the tourism and travel markets, with the Mpumalanga Parks Board offering their flagship game reserve near Badplaas to the group for a R198-million redevelopment into a White Mischief period theme park.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investment boost involves an astronomical injection into the regional economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpumalanga's annual budget, excluding social programmes, is just more than R4,7-billion and the pledged amount is almost a third of the agricultural sector's contribution to gross domestic product.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of the parks board's other reserves, including the Loskop Dam and the relatively pristine Blyde River Canyon will also reportedly be offered to the group for development into theme parks, with plans for an American-style paddle steamer on Loskop dam and a cable car down the centre of the Blyde Canyon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unclear whether the offer includes casino rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parks board's decision to turn its reserves into entertainment style theme parks is based on the fact that the Dolphin Group already manages Kenya's world famous Masai Mara Reserve successfully and also has vast international expertise in the hotel and resort industry from its other holdings in the east.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sources stressed, however, that the proposed investments would not just be centred in the province's parks, but would also focus on other economic sectors where Dolphin already has expertise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dolphin currently owns a number of multinational banking operations, a &quot; massive&quot; string of travel agencies and related subsidiaries as well as extensive motor-manufacturing interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group reportedly also has controlling shares in a large European newspaper chain and a series of smaller manufacturing enterprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The planners who set this deal up view the proposed investment, which will exceed the provincial government's entire annual budget in its final phases, as a way to suck in a series of additional foreign investors by looking at one of the really big guys,&quot; explained the source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This big guy will convince smaller guys to invest simply by being in the area and its subsidiaries will also offer the province access to a well- established business infrastructure and marketing machine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The planned investment, which a preliminary study suggests could total as much as R10- billion over a six-year period, was initially brokered by parks board chief executive officer, Alan Grey, during a secret visit to London in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grey met with senior Dolphin executives in London after breaking away from a scheduled fundraising tour of south-east Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The executives were reportedly so pleased with the meeting that they then flew Grey to the Masai Mara Reserve in Kenya to show him what they were capable of achieving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group of Dolphin executives then toured Mpumalanga for one week in October and identified potential investment areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grey is currently in London again, mainly to attend the World Travel Market exhibition, and could not be reached for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parks board representative Gary Sutter said on Wednesday that he did not have the authorisation to comment about the potential investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look you obviously have a source but we aren't prepared to offer any comment at this time. All the details will be released at a press conference on November 27,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alan Bernstein, deputy chairman of Conservation Corporation Africa (CCA), told the Mail &amp; Guardian that if the details about the investment pledge were true it would involve a massive boost for the country's entire tourism industry. CCAis Africa's biggest nature tourism corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The single biggest logjam in the development of a sustainable tourism industry in Southern Africa is how quickly we are able to build infrastructure and facilities in Mpumalanga, the wildlife heart of South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bernstein said game lodges in the province were running at full capacity and the lack of accommodation there was acting as a constraint to the expansion of tourism flows into the entire country as most overseas visitors want a wildlife experience during their visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Willie Sephton, acting director of conservation in the North West province, welcomed the news, but warned that Mpumalanga might be &quot;selling out&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From our experience of this thing we know how easy it is to lose control if the funders are not tied down as tightly as possible,&quot; he said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter John Massyn, director of Lodges of Manyeleti, added &quot;An injection of that scale into the regional economy will provide a boost of such a scale that I don't think a purist approach to environmental impact is appropriate provided certain basic standards are maintained to protect the quality of the resource base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would, however, like to see a commitment in the business plan to prevent the massive leakages of revenue out of the region that characterise these kinds of foreign investment in other parts of the Third World.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Public Protector Selby Baqwa confirmed this week that he is investigating allegations - uncovered during a probe into the beleaguered University of Zululand's fake degree scandal - against a senior academic at the institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Associate professor of history, Jabulani Maphalala, is the vice-dean of the arts faculty and a member of the University Council. Baqwa confirmed he is investigating allegations that Maphalala irregularly altered a course grade for a student in terms of an unauthorised re-examination which allowed the student to graduate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baqwa said the alleged irregularity was uncovered when it emerged that the student - now employed in the admissions, registration and records section of the university - had allegedly also received two other irregular course grade changes. These other changes fell into the probe's broader focus of course grades allegedly purchased illegally from corrupt officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former Inkatha Freedom Party central committee member, Maphalala applied unsuccessfully for the post of truth and reconciliation commissioner. His rejection was widely believed to result from his alleged involvement in the events surrounding the 1983 Ongoye Massacre in which several students were killed on the campus by an attacking impi after a student boycott opposed an invitation to IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi to address graduation ceremonies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maphalala could not be reached for comment at the time of going to press, but the documents in the possession of the Mail &amp; Guardian suggest he was aware of the transgression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University of Zululand's head of protection services, Ken MacKay, confirmed his receipt in June of a letter from Maphalala, dated June 28 1996, which explained that he had given an oral special re-examination to the student without authorisation from his head of department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I unfortunately forgot to tell Professor Johan de Villiers about this oral examination because of other commitments which needed my attention. I have apologised to Professor de Villers about not informing him about this student, &quot; Maphalala said in the letter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Door-to-Door campaigning has already started in some Free State towns as African National Congress members rally support for their candidates for the election of new leaders in the forthcoming provincial conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A drive for new members is also under way to win seats on the regional executive - amid complaints in areas known to support Patrick &quot;Terror&quot; Lekota of difficulty in obtaining recruitment packs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are currently 267 ANC branches in the province. The number will probably change in the run-up to the conference which is unlikely to be held before February next year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some ANC members claim there are branches which have not been properly constituted, and ANC regional leaders have admitted they issued membership to people who did not pay the required R12 membership fee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arrangements for the conference will be managed by the task group elected by the National Executive Committee to oversee the province. It comprises Labour Minister Tito Mboweni, parliamentary speaker Frene Ginwala, and MPs Malusi Gigaba, Dimpho Hani and Joe Nhlanhla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC will send organisers from other provinces to Free State regions to certify membership and monitor the recruitment of new members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People are queuing to join the ANC. We've had teachers, nurses and even policemen asking for membership cards because they want to be involved in the election of a new premier and chairperson,&quot; said a Bothaville ANC member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the branch has only received one recruitment pack from the Free State regional office this year. Each pack contains 240 membership applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bothaville ANC members claim their branch's request for more packs has been ignored because it supports Lekota. They claim the ANC regional leadership deliberately skewed the distribution of the packs to limit support for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We discovered that the Goldfields region, Qwa-Qwa region and Sasolburg region each received 25 packs. Look at the way they were distributed in the Sasolburg region: 15 packs were given to Parys, which is (ANC Free State former chair) Pat Matosa's stronghold, nine were given to Koppies, and Kroonstad received only one. Kroonstad's population is bigger than Parys and Koppies combined,&quot; the Bothaville branch complained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We suspect ANC organisers are being manipulated to boost support in areas where people will not necessarily support Terror. The task group will have to investigate this as a matter of urgency. We want to embark on a recruitment drive and we need those packs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are working as though this is a real election in which all people can participate. We are going out every night, knocking on doors and asking people to join the ANC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC members in Welkom claim they do not have a single recruitment pack, despite requesting them on several occasions from the regional office.  Members there are also planning a door-to-door campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC members in Bloemfontein say if the task group discovers there are people who received membership cards without paying a R12 fee, the membership should be cancelled immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC recently redivided the city into three zones, and a hectic recruitment drive has already started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not the first time allegations have been made in the Free State that recruitment has been unorthodox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Housing MEC Vax Mayekiso was found guilty by an ANC disciplinary hearing of distributing 17 packs unconstitutionally in the run-up to the local government elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Transnet has uncovered fraud and theft thought to have been costing subsidiary South African Airways's (SAA) duty-free operation at least R5-million a year - more than 10% of the operation's annual sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group's internal audit team paid Johannesburg-based private investigators R470 000 to undertake the six-month investigation into the operation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its report has just been finalised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one has been dismissed and no criminal charges have been brought as a result of the theft and fraud uncovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But SAA's duty-free sales head Andre Stewart was sacked six weeks ago after the probe uncovered an undeclared conflict of interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the pilfering is thought to have happened at the operation's Kempton Park headquarters, though some took place on board SAA flights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAA sources say such pilfering is common to airlines worldwide, but that the level in SAA was comparatively high. Management is now discussing plans to tighten controls over the business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transnet has also recruited independent investigators from accounting firm KPMG to probe procurement irregularities in its Portnet division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The investigation is at an early stage and is expected to run for some months. But one procurement manager and his assistant have already been suspended, and more suspensions are expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is thought the losses run to more than R10-million. Several of Portnet's major suppliers are involved in the investigation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A fuss this week over a personal secretary to Nelson Mandela who posed for Hustler magazine offers an alternative explanation for the decline of South Africa's porn industry: that the smut merchants don't recognise a golden opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lilian Arrison, a secretary at the president's official Cape Town residence, submitted her portrait to the 1996 Beaver Hunt Competition - the intimate nature of which is conveyed by the patriotic slogan offered by Hustler: &quot; Local labia is lekker.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hustler completely failed to recognise Ms Arrison's professional status - describing her merely as &quot;Lily, a secretary from the Mother City&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They missed the significance of her answer to a question as to what she would most enjoy in life. &quot;I would like a special person to shower with me,&quot; she answered.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - New details have emerged of gold syndicate suspect Paul Ekon's association with African National Congress leaders - including his alleged loan of a handgun to Thabo Mbeki - but ANC leaders say Ekon's largesse never influenced them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, police this week said they would accept an offer from Ekon to open his Swiss banking records - an offer that Ekon told the Mail &amp; Guardian would prove his innocence. Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi, replying to a question in Parliament last week, confirmed Ekon was under investigation by the police Diamond and Gold Branch and that the investigation would be completed &quot;when all the relevant documents have been received from Switzerland&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Ekon was being investigated for the &quot;illegal possession&quot; of R4,8- million in unwrought gold - a reference to a Johannesburg International Airport police raid in June last year, when 129kg of gold was confiscated.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a subsequent Rand Supreme Court tussle over the legality of the raid, police disclosed in an affidavit that they believed the consignment was part of a syndicate racket in which five tons of gold - worth almost a quarter of a billion rands at present value - had been smuggled to Europe and Britain in a single year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ekon, who is now resident in London, last week said he had been out of the country for &quot;six to nine months&quot; at the time of the raid and could not have been in possession of the gold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said when there were rumours linking him to the &quot;Chemfix&quot; gold smuggling operation a number of years ago, he had offered to fly a South African police officer to Geneva and instruct Swiss authorities to hand over documentation to prove his innocence. He was repeating the same offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police East Rand liaison officer Inspector Michelle Erasmus this week said the investigating officer &quot;would very much like Ekon to be in touch. He will gladly accept the offer - Ekon just has to say where and when.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ekon, a flamboyant 37-year-old millionaire businessman, entered the public eye this year when axed deputy minister Bantu Holomisa named him as the host of Mbeki's 50th birthday party in 1992 - claiming the party had been financed, through Ekon, by casino magnate Sol Kerzner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G has since learnt that Ekon cultivated extensive contacts in the ANC since the movement was unbanned in 1990 - to the consternation of some ANC members, who thought he was not to be trusted. Ekon socialised with ANC officials as senior as President Nelson Mandela, acted as a &quot;fixer&quot; in a number of ANC-sanctioned but failed black empowerment deals around the time of the 1994 elections and dispensed largesse to whomever would take it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But perhaps the most divisive was his gift of handguns to a number of ANC members - confirmed to the M&amp;G first by ANC insiders and later by Ekon himself. Ekon last week said he had offered &quot;tiny little guns&quot;, designed to be concealed easily, to a number of ANC leaders in the early 1990s - including Aziz Pahad (now Deputy Foreign Minister), Tokyo Sexwale (now Gauteng premier), and Chris Hani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ekon said Sexwale had accepted the offer, while Pahad had turned it down.  Hani's gun had been &quot;paid up&quot;, but he did not collect it and was assassinated two weeks later, in early 1993. He said he had lent his own handgun to Mbeki in about 1990, but that Mbeki lost it in a burglary - which got him (Ekon) into trouble with the authorities. &quot;You don't know how closely I was followed by the security police because I was friends with Thabo,&quot; Ekon claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbeki's liaison officer Ricky Naidoo this week said Mbeki, on a visit to a number of European countries, could not be reached for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a senior ANC National Executive Committee member told the M&amp;G that, while the ANC had problems safeguarding leaders after their return from exile, there was a feeling that offers like Ekon's should not be accepted. The organisation already had enough problems with &quot;unaccountable guns&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had the impression Ekon was attempting to &quot;compromise&quot; the country's leaders-to-be so that he could call in the favours after the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he confirmed ANC Department of Intelligence and Security members had done a background check on Ekon in the run-up to the 1994 elections. &quot;He was not checkable, and we were not happy with it. We could prove nothing against him, but we needed to be able to trust him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mufamadi this week denied Ekon had been in &quot;regular contact&quot; with him to discuss a possible amnesty, as claimed in a Sunday newspaper. &quot;I am not an attorney general. I cannot give assurances that he will not be prosecuted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mufamadi said he had not seen Ekon in &quot;perhaps more than two years&quot;, and that Ekon contacted him only once, a month or two ago, complaining that police appeared to be implicating him in the gold racket. Mufamadi said Ekon suggested &quot;a certain police officer&quot; could attest to his innocence. &quot;I met with this man (the police officer). He said to me, 'Minister, don't believe what the investigating officer is saying about Paul Ekon.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mufamadi said he could not preclude either version, but that he would leave the investigation to the police. &quot;If I were Paul Ekon, if I was convinced I'm not involved, I'd fly back and announce publicly that I'm here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he could not remember anyone warning him of an ANC background check on Ekon before the elections, but that during the struggle and in the run-up to the elections the organisation needed help from all types.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A political commentator, who knew both Ekon and ANC leaders at the time, said this week: &quot;If the question is whether he was a serious player or a useful groupie, I'd say it was pretty much the latter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he suspected it was a &quot;naive period&quot; for the ANC, when it easily trusted anyone offering help.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bloomfontein - President Nelson Mandela this week offered Patrick &quot;Terror&quot; Lekota a Cabinet post if, for the sake of party unity, he agreed to withdraw from the contest for chairman of the Free State province, according to party insiders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement late on Thursday that Lekota is to join the Senate is thought to be a stepping stone to a ministerial post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cabinet offer is said to have been made to Lekota during a private meeting as Mandela sought to end the internal African National Congress power struggles which have brought political chaos to the Free State</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela announced late on Thursday that Lekota will be joining the Senate - soon to become the Council of Provinces - as a &quot;respected ANC member&quot;. Since ministers can only be drawn from the ranks of MPs, this is a likely staging post to higher office.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another development earlier this week, leading ANC members in the province say that the National Executive Committee (NEC) ordered Lekota not to make himself available in the coming elections for Free State premier or regional chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News about the order has spread rapidly in the Free State and Lekota supporters are warning that they will make the province &quot;ungovernable&quot; if it is enforced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the Free State, ANC members are gearing up to contest the positions which became vacant two weeks ago when the NEC decided Lekota, his cabinet and the entire ANC provincial executive committee should resign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there is broad acceptance for the NEC's decision and for the task group it appointed to oversee provincial conference preparations, the week's developments have confirmed the suspicions of many Lekota supporters that there are moves to oust him permanently from the Free State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say that ANC branches should be involved in the process of electing a premier to ensure a popular choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC has gagged its Free State members from talking to the media on pain of disciplinary action, but many ordinary members who believe their viewpoints have been ignored by the ANC's national leadership spoke out this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some took bizarre precautions to ensure they would not be discovered breaking the gagging order. In Welkom, members gave elaborate instructions for a meeting place, parked their cars two blocks away and changed the venue of the meeting at the last minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked whether this was really necessary, one of them laughed wryly and said: &quot;I never thought I would need to use these tactics again. At least I haven't lost my old skills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the member, who had held a senior position in the Free State ANC, explained the reasons for their paranoia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have discovered that the NEC has instructed Terror not to stand in the elections for premier and chairperson of the Free State ANC,&quot; he claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe branches will nominate Terror for premier with overwhelming support, but when he's asked if he's available, he might say no if the NEC manages to convince him that he won't have a future in the organisation if he doesn't toe the line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the NEC does not allow Terror to exercise his democratic rights and stand for the election, it could have serious implications for the organisation. This is no (Bantu) Holomisa, they have formulated no charges against him that we know of and they have not found him guilty of anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Bloemfontein, sources close to Lekota added to the fears that he would not be allowed to contest his position. They had also heard he was being pressurised to withdraw from the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope he is going to resist them, we will rally as much support for him as we can. They have no right to do this, it's as though they have judged him already and found that he is guilty,&quot; a source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC members in Bothaville, a small town 170km north of Bloemfontein, believe they are Lekota's most ardent supporters and are prepared to take on their entire leadership to ensure he is treated fairly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While we believe it's important our voices are heard, it's not that important that we should risk our membership of the ANC, so no names please,&quot; said ANC members in Bothaville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This branch has written letters to Shell House (the ANC's national headquarters) and to Nelson Mandela on a number of issues which concern us.  Mandela responded, but all he said was that we should refer our problems to Shell House,&quot; said a member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We wrote to Shell House again, and the only response was that we were told to observe proper protocol and send our complaints to the proper channel, the regional leadership. They didn't seem to understand that our problem was with the regional leadership, we couldn't complain to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There will be a big crisis in the Free State if Terror is not allowed to stand as premier or chairman of the ANC. This province will never recover,,&quot; another Bothaville member vowed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Refugees continued to stream across the Zairean border into Rwanda throughout the day but there are no hard figures on numbers of arrivals. By 1pm local time UNHCR had estimated that 15,000 people had arrived in Gisenyi. UNHCR Geneva said that if the rate of arrival did not slow, 100,000 were expected by this evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exodus was so far reported &quot;orderly&quot; and aid agencies were standing by in Gisenyi. WFP said it could feed 200,000 people for 10 days, but a spokesperson for WFP in Gisenyi expressed concern about the capacity of aid agencies to cope with the sheer numbers. UN eyewitnesses said Mugunga camp - from where most of the returnees were walking - was empty at midday. TV pictures have shown the remains of a massacre at the deserted camp of fifteen people, including women and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First-hand accounts from refugees say that the Interahamwe and former Rwandan forces tried to make the refugees retreat with them into the interior yesterday. Some of the refugees who refused to go with the Hutu militants were reportedly killed, and an unknown number accompanied them into the interior. Refugees are also reportedly heading towards Masisi. There are also some 490,000 refugees from Bukavu and Uvira who have not been accounted for.  Concentrations of refugees - apparently mixed up with the internally displaced - remain inaccessible in the Zairean interior.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR chief Sagata Ogata told the BBC she was &quot;elated&quot; at the refugee exodus, but stressed that measures should be taken to ensure the safety of thousands of other refugees hiding out further in the interior. Madame Ogata said she would still like the help of a multi-national force to set up road security and to encourage other refugees still inside Zaire to repatriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a BBC report Zaire's Minister of Information said the government was happy the refugees were repatriating as &quot;it was the only solution&quot;. He also expressed frustration that Zaire had not been properly consulted about the mandate of the multi-national forces. The ICRC today launched an appeal for 49 million Swiss francs (US$38.5 million) to cover the cost of its operation in eastern Zaire for three months. It said Kinshasa had given it permission to operate throughout Zairean territory, and it was now in a position to provide non-food relief supplies for 525,000 people and food for 250,000 people per month. It was not planning to set up new camps, but to help people on the move. Should reports of epidemics be confirmed, the ICRC would be able to treat 30,000 people. A UN interagency flash appeal is due to be launched early next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) appealed yesterday to the UN to immediately authorise the deployment of a multinational force, warning otherwise of tens of thousands of deaths among the refugees and internally displaced people.  The agency said it was outraged by the &quot;apathy&quot; of the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a day of intense negotiations, Western nations at the UN agreed late Thursday on a mandate for deploying a multinational force in eastern Zaire.  The UN Security Council is due to authorise the force later today. The force is expected to eventually comprise at least 10,000 troops aimed at &quot; facilitating&quot; the return of refugees. Dutch foreign minister Hans van Mierlo on Thursday joined the calls for disarming Hutu militias, but the Canadian commander of the force Lt-Gen Maurice Baril ruled out the possibility at a news conference in New York. Baril said the main headquarters would be in Goma, with branches in Kigali and Kinshasa. Staging bases would be established in Kigali, Entebbe, and Nairobi, with two &quot;secure forward operations bases&quot; in Goma and Bukavu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Britain sent a 43-strong reconnaissance party to the region today to check conditions on the ground, and Brazil offered to send 150 troops. The commander of American troops possibly to be sent to eastern Zaire arrived in Kigali on Thursday, accompanied by about 40 other soldiers, state-run Rwandan radio reported. He said the group had come to assess the situation and decide whether US troops should be sent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi said today it would not host a multinational force unless regional economic sanctions were lifted. &quot;You can't leave the population here to suffer in misery while helping those on the other side of the border,&quot; foreign minister Luc Rukingama told AFP. &quot;We shall be very happy to make our ports and airports available as soon as the economic blockade is lifted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN Special Envoy Raymond Chretien was headed for Burundi today to discuss the crisis in eastern Zaire with Pierre Buyoya. A spokesman for Chretien said he met Zairean leaders in Kinshasa on Thursday and received assurances that US troops within a multinational force would be welcome. Chretien is due to meet Rwandan president Bizimungu in Kigali on Saturday. Chretien, travelling with UN Humanitarian Coordinator Sergio Vieira de Mello was scheduled to arrive in Kigali tonight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zairean deputy premier Mutombo Bakafwa Nsenda said in Rome today that Zaire had not been formally notified of plans for a multinational force and in any case, his country would not allow relief aid for refugees to be brought in.  The aid must be placed and distributed in Rwanda, he added. According to BBC radio, the Zairean information minister said his country was happy the refugees were returning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mobutu expressed on Thursday support for humanitarian aid corridors to allow the repatriation of refugees from his country, a visiting OAU delegation said. He told the delegation at his villa near the French city of Nice that he was ready to do anything to restore peace and stability to the region and insisted on the inviolability of frontiers. Opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi meanwhile said he was ready to meet Mobutu in France for talks on forming a government to resolve the crisis in the east. He told a Kinshasa news conference on Thursday it was &quot;high time&quot; responsible Zaireans met to resolve the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belgian commercial VTM television reported Thursday that Tutsi rebels were holding 40 Belgian nationals in Goma. Foreign minister Erik Derycke told the television the Belgians were not physically threatened but their movements were limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A UNHCR report on Thursday said at least 80,000 internally displaced people had gathered in the northern town of Kisangani where a team from UNHCR, WFP and UNICEF was looking into the possibility of launching an assistance programme. According to unconfirmed reports, another 80,000 refugees were said to be in the Walikale area, about 80 kms west of Goma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of returnees to Burundi from refugee camps near Uvira has dropped sharply raising concern among aid workers, DHA reported from Bujumbura between 7-12 November. About 140,000 of the 220,000 refugees who fled the camps were Burundian Hutus but only 40,000 of them have been accounted for. Tens of thousands of refugees have also returned directly from South Kivu to the volatile northwest Cibitoke province. Between 12,000 and 16, 000 are beleived to be living in fields near Buganda, 10km south of Cibitoke town. Another 3,000 are in another camp north of Cibitoke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR said 21,000 people had fled Burundi to Tanzania so far this month, compared with 8,100 in October. There were 14,500 refugees in Kibundo camp and over 6,600 in Kasulu as of yesterday. 15,000 refugees were registered in the Kigoma region, including a small number of Burundians and Rwandans, and there were 10,000 new arrivals in lakeside villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official Ugandan New Vision newspaper reported today that some 70,000 people had fled their homes near the Uganda-Zaire border in the Kasese area after intensive fighting. It quoted military sources as saying the clashes were between Zairean-assisted Ugandan dissidents and Ugandan government forces aided by Zairean Tutsis rebels.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) today launched an appeal for 49 million Swiss francs (38.5 US dollars) to cover the cost of its operation to protect and assist some of the two million people affected by the conflict in eastern Zaire for three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICRC has just obtained confirmation from the authorities in Kinshasa that it may work throughout the territory of the Republic of Zaire, although certain formalities remain to be completed. An ICRC-chartered Hercules aircraft left Nairobi this morning with 14 tonnes of high-energy biscuits, two tonnes of medical supplies and 2,000 blankets. It landed in Kinshasa at about 10 a.m. local time before going on to Kisangani, where a team is already setting up a logistics base.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICRC delegation in Zaire has drawn up a plan of action to bring desperately needed aid to displaced persons. Existing health facilities in the areas affected by the conflict will receive support, and medical teams will be sent to hospitals in Kivu province and in Kisangani. A field hospital available in Nairobi could very quickly be set up in Zaire. Teams of specialists will make sure that drinking water is available in places where large numbers of refugees and displaced persons have gathered. Should reports of epidemics be confirmed, the ICRC would be able to treat 30,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICRC is in a position to provide non-food relief supplies (blankets, plastic sheeting, jerrycans and soap) for 525,000 people, and food for 250, 000 people per month. The aim is not to set up new camps, but to distribute survival rations and water to displaced people on the move or making their way home. The ICRC is also planning a resettlement programme for displaced Zairians returning to their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICRC has officially reminded the parties to the armed conflict that the rules of international humanitarian law are applicable. It has a mandate to protect and assist conflict victims, and will work in close coordination with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, which is specifically in charge of assistance to refugees. A coordination unit is to be set up, comprising representatives of the main humanitarian organizations and of the multinational force which is about to become operational.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - UNHCR reported that by 1pm local time that 15,000 people have arrived in Gisenyi, Rwanda. WFP said an estimated 70,000 others were backed up at the border. CNN reported &quot;wildly fluctuating figures&quot;, but described the exodus as &quot;countless thousands&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Kessler, UNHCR Nairobi, said there was a 25 mile long stream of people, which included people from Mugunga, Lac Vert, Sake, Kahindo and Katale. UNHCR Geneva estimate that if refugees continue arriving at the present rate, 100,000 are expected by this evening.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exodus is reportedly &quot;orderly&quot; at this stage, with aid agencies waiting to recieve the refugees/returnees in Gisenyi, Rwanda. The World Food Programme has at least 750 tons of food in Gisenyi, which can feed 200,000 people for ten days, said a WFP representative. There are also food rations (two month food packages) in Nkamira way-station nearby. The United Nations and NGOs have food stocks and preparations in Rwanda. UNHCR says there is a reception centre at Umubano which has the capacity for 15,000 people. There are two more reception centres at Nkamira and Gisenyi-College. UNHCR have additional relief stocks in Kigali (Rwanda) and Kampala (Uganda).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations eye-witnesses report Mugunga camp empty. TV pictures have been shown of a massacre at the deserted camp of fifteen people, including women and children. First-hand accounts from refugees say that the Interahamwe and former Rwandan forces tried to make the refugees retreat with them into the interior yesterday, and began destroying the refugee huts. Some of the refugees who refused to go with the Hutu militants were reportedly killed, and an unknown number accompanied them into the interior. Refugees are also reportedly heading towards Masisi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is assumed that most of the people fleeing towards the border are Rwandan refugees, but they could also include internally displaced Zaireans.  One journalist speculated that there could be members of the former Rwandan forces (ex-FAR) and the Interahamwe militia among them. The refugees returning to Rwanda are being screened and searched, slowing down the numbers crossing into Rwanda. One journalist in Gisenyi told IRIN that groups of Rwandan personnel - some identified as soldiers in civilian clothes - were taking details of families, numbers of children and wives and details of original commune and prefecture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People arriving at the border are said to be in reasonably good condition, but medical personnel caution that the strongest people will arrive first.  There have also been two confirmed cases of cholera at Goma hospital of people from Sake, according to WHO. Sake is one of the endemic cholera areas in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the Rwandan returnees will reportedly be trucked immediately back to their home communes, although a system of repatriation or screening has yet to be made public. One UN official told IRIN that it was essential that a huge mass of people should not congregate at the border as it would rapidly lead to problems of disease and sanitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although some press reports portray the exodus as a &quot;solution&quot; to the eastern Zaire crisis, hundreds of thousands of refugees remain unaccounted for. Mugunga camp held about 400,000 refugees before the crisis, and the total number of refugees in the Goma area was 715,000. Reports so far indicate that the numbers heading for the border are likely to be around 100, 000. First hand accounts from refugees arriving over the border describe long walks in the forest, over the last two weeks, indicating that many of those arriving have initially come from the Katale and Kahindo camps and not the original Mugunga population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also some 490,000 refugees from Bukavu and Uvira who have not been accounted for. Concentrations of refugees - apparently mixed up with the internally displaced - remain inaccesible in the Zairean interior.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Mugunga camp is reported by UN eyewitnesses as &quot;empty&quot;.  Journalists and aid agencies report tens of thousands of refugees fleeing through Goma and arriving at the Rwandan border. Thousands have already crossed. CNN reported that rebel forces appear to have pushed the former Rwanda forces (ex-FAR) and Interahamwe militia back, causing the flight of refugees who had been contained inside the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, people fleeing towards the Rwandan border are said to include Zairean displaced, and, according to CNN, also ex-FAR and Hutu militia. It is not yet clear whether all refugees from Mugunga camp are fleeing towards the Rwandan border. Mugunga camp was said to contain about 400,000 before dispersal. Other refugees may have fled into the interior with the ex-FAR and militia, or been casualties of heavy fighting in the camp. The condition of people arriving at the border has been reported as &quot;generally good&quot;. Refugees from Mugunga would have only about 15 kilometres to flee, once out of the camp, and had reportedly been receiving some food from existing stocks inside the camp as recently as last week. Mugunga hospital had also been reported last week as functioning at a rudimentary level.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports by the American Refugee Committee told IRIN that Mugunga camp had been displaced about four kilometres yesterday because of heavy fighting.  Sources in Goma and Sake alledge that rebels surrounding the camp had included an elite force of Rwandan soldiers. Rebels last week reportedly managed to push back the ex-FAR behind Mugunga, and now control the road up to Sake. Displaced Zaireans from Goma - who moved west when Goma was first taken by rebels - have been forced to flee towards Minova (south west of Sake) . Retreating Zairean soldiers congregating in Sake have fled north to Kisangani. Fighting is primarily between the ex-FAR and the rebel Alliance of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL). American Refugee Committee say Kirotshe hospital admitted 60 wounded Zaireans yesterday - believed to be from fighting around Sake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heavy fighting reported around Goma and Sake yesterday held up aid assessment missions. UNHCR and other agencies have been preparing for an influx of returnees into Gisenyi, Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A multinational intervention force still awaits a mandate from the UN Security Council, which should decide on the matter today or Saturday. An advance party of twenty-five Canadians is expected in Nairobi today. The US government, which sent an advance team of forty personnel to Entebbe, Uganda, says its forces can only be inserted into a &quot;non-hostile&quot; environment before US troops will proceed into eastern Zaire. The US also would prefer to have &quot; complicity&quot; from governments in the region. Both the US and the Canadian government say they will not attempt to disarm the armed groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebel Alliance of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo- Zaire (ADFL) instituted a unilaterally declared ceasefire on November 4, which held tenuously in areas accessible to aid workers and journalists.  Securing a ceasefire is difficult in that there are a number of different armed groups involved in the conflict: they include the rebel ADFL; the Zairean armed forces; Zairean militia groups (including the Bangilima and the Mai-Mai); and the former Rwanda armed forces (ex-FAR) and Interahamwe militia.  Other armed groups reported to have been involved in the conflict are Rwandan government forces, and the Zairean Camp Security Contingent (previously guarding the camps).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is generally agreed by the United Nations and aid agencies that the number, condition and location of refugees and internally displaced persons is not known, and that lack of information continues to be a major problem.  Requested satellite images of the refugees' locations are said to be too indistinct to be of assistance. Different reports of the last week put the refugees in the following approximate locations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOMA -- refugees from Mugunga camp reported today as fleeing towards the Rwandan border as rebels push back ex-FAR and the Interhamwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TONGO -- From the Kahindo and Katale camps north of Goma, who reportedly split into smaller groups when caught up in fighting earlier this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MASISI -- From Sake, and also from the Kahindo and Katale camps, who are now concentrated mainly in the forest near Masisi town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYIRAGONGO -- there are other reports of refugees from Kahindo and Katale who fled through the lava fields or skirted round by the edge of the forest, and are heading towards the Goma area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUKAVU -- Many Bukavu refugees reportedly west of Bukavu, towards Chimanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Internally displaced people are also of concern, and are reportedly mixed with the refugees in some areas. The Fizi area, south of Uvira, reportedly contains a concentration of internally displaced, as well as the fishing villages along the coast line. High tension is reported to exist between the local population and the refugees. Refugees and internally displaced in the interior are believed to be surviving on what produce they can find from village fields and gardens. Although water is available in many areas, many internally displaced people and refugees are reportedly suffering from dehydration because of the onset of diarrhoeal diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations World Health Organisation is distributing an information sheet for aid organisations on protocol for the treatment of Shigella (bloody diarrhoea) and cholera - the two epidemics which decimated massive concentrations of refugees who crossed into eastern Zaire in 1994.  Anticipation of massive numbers of deaths in the present crisis are now being treated with more caution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior UN nutritionists gave IRIN the following &quot;statistical background&quot; to help estimate the scale of the crisis: Before the crisis, there was an average rate of 84 deaths per day, based on an estimated crude death rate of 0.7 per 10,000 per day in a refugee population of 1.2 million. The birth rate would add about 137 live babies each day. This is considered acceptable by nutritionists and aid workers. Alarm bells ring once the death rate rise about 1 per 10,000 per day; if it reaches 2 per 10,000 per day it is considered a crisis. During the peak of the diarrhoeal disease epidemic in Goma in 1994, the death rate was 25 per 10,000 per day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is an unprecedented paucity of information on the condition of the refugees in the current crisis, and conflicting estimates of deaths, but death-rate calculations indicate about 480-960 deaths per day. A senior nutritionist warned that the death rate is likely to increase as soon as refugees start congregating in large numbers, because of sanitation problems.  The nutritionist speculated that refugees in the interior may have a better chance of survival if they were travelling in small groups.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - One hundred thousand people have so far crossed the border at Gisenyi as of 10:30 am local time, according to the UN Humanitarian Coordinator's spokesperson, Paul Stromberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of the massive return, the United Nations Security Council has mandated a multi-national force to use &quot;all necessary means&quot; to facilitate a humanitarian operation in eastern Zaire. On November 15 (Friday) the Security Council authorised deployment of troops under Chapter VII, which allows for intervention without the consent of the affected governments, and the use of force. The operation is to end on 31 March 1997 unless the Council decides on an earlier date. Details of a follow-on operation to succeed the multi- national force are to be considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost of the operation is to be borne primarily by the participating member states, but the Security Council welcomed the establishment by the Secretary General of a voluntary trust fund to support African participation in the force. It also called for an international conference on peace, security and development in the Great Lakes region under the auspices of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Controversy among member states about whether to disarm or engage the various armed groups continues. The powerful mandate remains open to interpretation. Chapter VII is the same mandate that was invoked for Somalia in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the Canadian and US government have made it a condition of participation that they will not attempt disarmament. The Security Council resolution welcomed the offer of leadership by the Canadian government. The US - which has already deployed 40 troops to neighbouring Uganda - has gone further by asking for a &quot;de facto ceasefire&quot; and says it does not wish to put troops into a &quot;hostile&quot; enviroment. However, regional leaders and humanitarian organisations continue to stress the need to separate out armed Hutu militants from genuine refugees, and remain concerned about the numbers of refugees and internally displaced people still in areas inaccessible because of armed groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday's massive exodus of thousands of people into Rwanda, which had prompted comments in the press that there was no longer need for a multi- national force. Estimates of Rwandan refugees heading for the border fluctuate wildly between tens and hundreds of thousands. Some journalists report that registration systems in Rwanda and on the border are breaking down. However, even if the highest estimate is taken, it still means that at least half a million refugees remain inside Zaire - along with unknown concentrations of internally displaced persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire presented objections to the authorisation of the force. Zaire's representative, Lukabu Khabouji N'Zaji, said that the Zairean government &quot; should be formally consulted on the composition and mandate of the force and the measures needed to implement the decision&quot;. He reiterated the stance that Zaire has maintained since fighting broke out in eastern Zaire, namely that Zaire was the victim of agression by regular armed forces of Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi. He said that Zaire believed the force should have its headquarters in Zaire, and objected to planning done in Kigali. The representative said the force should have a political as well as humanitarian mandate, and should be able to move around to defend itself militarily if blocked by armed aggressors. Zaire also insisted that there should be no recognition of rebel administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan representative at the UN, Gideon Kayinamura, said the proposed multi-national force &quot;is no longer relevant as far as rescuing Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire is concerned&quot;. He said plans for the proposed force should be altered to adapt to the changing situation on the ground, and should include a new mandate. The representative said a new mandate should consider disarming the ex-Rwandan Government soldiers and militia, as well as &quot;availing adequate resources to facilitate the rehabilitation and re- integration of the returning refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement to the Security Council, the Canadian representative, Robert Fowler, said there was still need for a force despite the &quot;heartening news&quot; of returning refugees. In reference to the mandate, he interpreted it as not including disarmament or engagement with armed groups. He said it was important to be clear about what the multinational force was seeking to accomplish, which was facilitation of humanitarian assistance - &quot;We do not, therefore, envisage disarmament or interposition as elements of the Force's mandate. Indeed, disarmament cannot be part of this mandate, as it would require a much larger and robust force which would need to engage in a war with those who most evidently do not wish to be disarmed.&quot; Canada anticipates a multi-national force 10 - 15,000 strong. Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy yesterday claimed that the exodus of refugees across the border was a &quot;direct consequence&quot; of the plan to send a Canadian-led multi-national force to the region, reports AFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US representative Madeleine Albright welcomed the formation of a force with Canadian leadership, but said &quot;some outstanding questions concerning the organisation and operation of the mission remain to be worked out&quot;. The United States has faced criticism for dragging its feet over the multinational force, until Canada offered to lead on Tuesday November 12th.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Security Council has been strongly criticised by Kenyan president Daniel arap Moi for not consulting African nations about preparations for an intervention force in Zaire. In Rome, at the UN World Food Summit, President Moi said yesterday he expected the UN to consult with regional leaders through the OAU, but had only learned of authorisation for intervention &quot; through the media&quot;. President Moi hosted the November 5th Nairobi Summit which brought together regional leaders and affected states (except for Burundi, still under regional sanctions). The Nairobi Summit, which called for a multi-national force with a strong African component and peace talks, was widely seen as the first main step taken to address the eastern Zaire crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi on Friday said the main objective of the multi-national force should be to disarm the former Rwandan forces and Interahamwe militia. A statement issued by Burundi's UN ambassador said they should be held in centres far from the borders with Burundi and Rwanda. The statement warned that otherwise, the mission would be a repeat of 1994 in Rwanda when UNAMIR &quot; helped unleash the genocide&quot;. The statement also called for an international conference on the Great Lakes region, under UN and OAU auspices, aimed at triggering a massive return of refugees to their countries. It added that while world attention was focused on Zaire, Burundi which was toiling under economic sanctions, had been forgotten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN Special Envoy Raymond Chretien met Burundian leader Pierre Buyoya on Friday to discuss the multi-national force. According to Chretien, Buyoya said he had no objections to the force but that he needed more details of the mission before he would allow the establishment of a base in Bujumbura. He described Buyoya's attitude as &quot;extremely practical.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior UN official said today he was concerned about the military's apparent lack of consultation with the humanitarian community regarding the scope of operations in regard to humanitarian needs. He said it appeared the military were planning deployment and operations in isolation, as in Somalia in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of refugees continued to stream across the Rwandan border at Gisenyi today after spending a rainy night in the open or under makeshift shelters. A spokesman for the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Kigali said they were crossing at the rate of 12,000 an hour. According to UNHCR, a further 300,000 people were on their way from Mugunga and further west. A UN refugee official reported first thing this morning, two long columns of people could be seen snaking into Goma from the west. UNHCR expects a further 250,000 people to cross the border today. Five hundred unaccompanied children have been registered so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan president Pasteur Bizimungu and his cabinet were at the border yesterday to welcome home the refugees. He told them they would be able to reclaim their property in Rwanda, and that only the guilty would have anything to fear. CNN showed pictures of the refugees applauding Bizimungu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the returnees are being encouraged to continue to the Nkamira transit camp, 25km from the border, for onward trucking to their home communes. Along the way, they are being supplied with nutritional biscuits and water. At Nkamira, aid agencies hope to separate the refugees into groups according to the distance of their home communes. Food packages will be handed out at prefectural level, before the refugees return to their communes.  Fifty trucks organised by UNHCR are available, with more on standby, and the first truckloads are expected in the home communes today. The refugees will receive plastic sheeting, jerry cans and blankets. Screening by the Rwandan government will now take place in the home communes, apart from the search for weapons at the border. Other refugees are being housed at the Umubano camp near the border crossing, which has a capacity for 30,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR estimates it has supplies for 50,000 people in Gisenyi and additional stocks are being brought in for another 20,000 people. UNHCR stocks of food and non-food items in Rwanda are sufficient for 200,000 people. The World Food Programme meanwhile says it has 30,000 MT of food in Rwanda, enough to feed 700,000 people for 45 days, and NGOs have emergency relief for another 250,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heavy weapons fire was heard in eastern Zaire from the Gisenyi area around 10:00 local time today, AFP reported. It said a UN agency official described how a small plane flying over Goma and Gisenyi came under anti-aircraft fire, although it was not hit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sixty-five &quot;invaders&quot; and three Ugandan soldiers have been killed in two days of fighting in western Uganda, according to the New Vision today. The invaders were still in control of Mpondwe border post by yesterday afternoon.  A Ugandan newspaper reported today that Health Minister Crispus Kiyonga narrowly escaped death in a rebel ambush on the Ugandan-Zaire border Thursday.  According to the Monitor, he was forced to abandon his car and run on foot for one kilometre as rebels fired bullets in his direction. Fighting has been raging in the Kasese border area since Wednesday between Ugandan troops and Zairean-backed rebels.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - As Rwandan refugees streamed out of the major camp at Mugunga in eastern Zaire, Human Rights Watch/Africa today stressed that any new camps established for them must exclude anyone bearing arms, including armed soldiers of the former Rwandan army and militia responsible for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. According to Peter Takirambudde, Director of Human Rights Watch/Africa, &quot;When refugee camps were first established in Zaire, the international community permitted the civilian and military authorities who had carried out a genocide to reassert their control over the refugee population. To fail to separate armed elements from unarmed refugees now would simply repeat the mistake, postponing any real solution to the crisis.  The proposed international force cannot simply hand out porridge; it must offer effective protection for the lives and human rights of the refugees.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Troops of the United States and other participants in the multinational force should rigorously screen all who seek entry to the new sites to ensure that no one bearing arms is admitted. In addition, to protect camps and humanitarian relief corridors, the force must also effectively police areas inside and around the perimeters of the camps to protect refugees and humanitarian workers from assault or intimidation. If the multinational force fails to establish its authority within the camp sites, the Rwandans who directed the genocide could once again take control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The human rights organization insisted that the force must be mandated to arrest any person indicted by or sought by the International Tribunal for Rwanda in connection with the 1994 genocide. &quot;All the talk of international justice is hollow rhetoric unless the troops are directed to arrest those sought by the Tribunal and provided with the means to do so,&quot; Takirambudde said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch/Africa also urged the international community to provide resources needed to increase the number of United Nations Human Rights Field Officers monitoring the situation within Rwanda. The Rwandan government has reportedly agreed to adding 200 officers to the 100 now working in the country. This addition of human rights monitors would increase confidence among the returning refugees and help ensure their safe integration into their home communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the returning refugees, some will certainly be arrested on charges of having participated in the genocide and will swell further the ranks of those now awaiting trial in Rwandan prisons. More than 83,000 persons are detained in inhumane conditions. Rwanda recently adopted a law establishing a system of plea-bargaining for many of those accused of genocide and setting the punishment for those found guilty. It has also received substantial foreign aid for rehabilitating the judicial system and for training magistrates and other judicial personnel. With the legal framework in place and the human and material resources now available, Rwanda should proceed immediately with trial of persons accused of genocide. It must also ensure that future arrests, whether among those now resident in the country or those returning from the camps, be made according to due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While acknowledging the need for an international humanitarian response, Human Rights Watch stressed that the fundamental causes of the crisis impunity for past crimes, lack of protection for human rights, and the importance of dialogue among the political actors still must be addressed by both local and international governments.</SPAN></P>

Note: The last fact sheet was dated November 8, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current Humanitarian Situation:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to shelling from Mugunga camp on November 13, fighting broke out on November 14 between the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) rebels in Goma and Hutu militia in Mugunga camp. As a result, some 100,000 people were reported fleeing the camp towards Goma and the United Nations (U.N.) High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported Mugunga camp had been destroyed. The U.N. World Food Program (WFP) estimates at least 75,000 people crossed the border into Rwanda at Petite Barriere on November 15. WFP has enough food stocks pre-positioned at the border to support this group for two weeks and is bringing in additional commodities in anticipation of larger flows. It is also reported that there are sufficient medical supplies and water for the immediate future. The Government of Rwanda (GOR) agreed on November 11 to allow U.N. agencies and nine non-governmental organizations to provide relief to eastern Zaire via Rwanda.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goma: ADFL rebel leader, Laurent Kabila, allowed the U.N. to bring seven trucks of food and medical supplies to Goma from Rwanda on November 11.  However, the supplies were impounded overnight in a rebel-guarded stadium. On November 13 the first attempted food distribution in Goma was disrupted by shelling from Mugunga camp. The U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs (UNDHA) confirms that rebels and the U.N. reached an aid distribution agreement. UNDHA also reports that thousands of Rwandan refugees are sheltering in the forests of Masisi and about 200 refugees were killed on November 13 as a result of fighting around Tonga, northwest of Katale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kisangani: UNHCR estimates that 80,000 people have been displaced by the Zairean army southeast of Kisangani at Lubutu. U.N. agencies plan to airlift relief supplies to Kinshasa and then move supplies forward to Kisangani to support operations targetting displaced persons and accessible refugee populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bukavu: A U.N. assessment team was able to cross into Bukavu on November 11 but has since been denied access. The team reported that the town has no power or running water, no doctors or drugs are available in the government hospital, and no supplies have reached the town since the fighting began.  Limited supplies of gasoline are available, and the town's market re-opened on November 9. WFP has staff and trucks carrying food commodities standing by on the border should clearance be granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uvira: U.N. assessment teams are attempting to contact authorities in Uvira to gain clearance to cross into Zaire from Burundi. U.N. teams are waiting on the border should clearance be granted. The UNDHA reports that roughly 100, 000 displaced Zairians and refugees (primarily Burundians) have flocked to Fizi. Last week a UNHCR team sent a mission to Kalemie, however the team was unable to proceed to Fizi or Uvira. There is very little information regarding this area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numbers Affected:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up to one million Rwandan and Burundian refugees and internally displaced Zairians have been affected by the fighting. Three thousand Burundian returnees have arrived at Gatumba, Burundi; an estimated 16,000 returnees have crossed into Cibitoke, Burundi from Uvira; 5,300 Zairian refugees have fled to Burundi; 10,600 Zairian and Rwandan refugees have crossed into Kisoro and Ishasha ports in Uganda. Before the movement on November 15, 4,958 refugees (mainly Zairean) and 3,400 Rwandan returnees had crossed into Rwanda at Gisenyi and Cyangugu. As of the morning of November 14, Tanzania was hosting 11,233 Zairean, 2,795 Burundian, and 606 Rwandan refugees in Kigoma.  UNHCR estimates that 12,000 new refugees have also congregated in villages along Lake Tanganyika. On November 14, some 9,300 Burundians crossed the Tanzanian border fleeing fighting in eastern Burundi. The Congo and Zambia have received roughly 1,000 refugees each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Government Assistance (USG):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of USAID/BHR/OFDA's Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) are on the Gisenyi/Goma border monitoring the urgent situation and coordinating the USG response. The DART also crossed into Bukavu briefly on November 14. On November 13, the USG announced that it will participate &quot;in principle&quot; in a multinational force to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and repatriation of refugees. Roughly 1,000 troops are expected to be deployed to Zaire and up to 4,000 other troops may be sent to neighboring countries to support the operation. A USG 40 member military team was in Kigali on November 13 to assess the region's humanitarian and security situation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Text of remarks as prepared for delivery by Zimbabwean Ambassador Bernard Midzi to a sub-Saharan African trade conference sponsored by the State Department and the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA) on November 14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Permit me to thank the American Foreign Service Association for organizing this business leaders' symposium on &quot;Trade and Investment Opportunities in Sub-Saharan Africa.&quot; As for the title of the symposium, participants in this plenary may want to reconsider or amend it to read &quot;Business and Development opportunities in African countries.&quot; The diversities of African countries, in many respects, might be lost in the (original) title. Rather, sub-Saharan Africa is composed of 48 diverse nations with diverse characteristics.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consideration of any subject related to Africa should take into account the existence of countries whose historical trajectories are not identical; whose levels of development are at different stages; and whose responses to challenges of development or lack thereof are varied; whose levels of commitment to creating conditions that are necessary for development and economic growth may be critically impinged upon by domestic and or exogenous conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who have read the article in the February 1994 issue of the Atlantic Monthly Magazine by David Kaplan on &quot;The Coming Chaos&quot; might be tempted to accept that Kaplan's conclusions have been vindicated by events taking place in the Great Lakes region in Central Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the temptation to agree with Kaplan is real, I invite you to consider what Jeffrey Sachs said recently in his testimony to the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade: &quot;Peace, of course, is not so easily guaranteed, but the conditions of peace on the continent are better than today's ghastly headlines would suggest. Several of the large-scale conflicts that have ravaged the continent are over or nearly so. The end of apartheid has ended confrontations throughout southern Africa. Mozambique and Namibia are at peace, and in Angola, the fighting is subsiding. Relations between Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania are better than at any time in the past 25 years.  Ethiopia's 30-year civil war has come to an end with Eritrean independence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an illustration of the absurdity and misperception of Kaplan's article, could it be true that the flutterings of a butterfly's wings in the Amazon forest could cause the collapse of buildings in New York? If so, how come the stampede of zebra hoofs in one corner of sub-Saharan Africa is said to cause an earthquake thousands of miles away?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations - Statement as prepared for delivery by Madeleine K.  Albright, the United States' representative to the United Nations, to the Security Council November 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With great sadness, the world is once again watching tragedy unfold in Central Africa. None of us can forget the shock and horror of the strife in Rwanda in 1994, the hundreds of thousands of innocent people slaughtered in churches and schoolyards and in their homes. Millions of refugees fled the violence across the borders into Zaire and Tanzania. Thousands died in makeshift camps until the international community was able to bring water, food and medicine. Now, in the last few weeks, new fighting again has sent most refugees and displaced persons into flight, danger, and deprivation, and blocked humanitarian support from reaching them. Their plight is urgent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The international community is, as always, ready to assist those most in need -- the innocent civilians caught between fighting and fear. Last week the Security Council adopted a resolution which laid the basis for a rapid and effective international response. In the interim, the Secretary-General's special envoy and the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) have been working to calm the situation and aid the refugees. And a lot of nations have been developing coordinated plans for a temporary humanitarian force, under the leadership of Canada, to permit restoration of aid and repatriation of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the complexities of the situation in Eastern Zaire, with multiple armed groups and a fragile political environment, require prudent preparation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States strongly supports the initiative of the Canadian government to lead a multinational force to allow the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the refugees and displaced persons in the current crisis, with the dual function of facilitating the voluntary repatriation of refugees to their home countries. We welcome the offers by nations from around the world to participate in the international force that the Security Council is authorizing with this resolution, and the many offers of humanitarian assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The long-term solution is voluntary repatriation of the refugees. To avert a recurrence of this humanitarian tragedy, refugees who wish to return to Rwanda must be able to do so. It appears, as we speak, that perhaps tens of thousands are finally taking advantage of this opportunity. We welcome this development and hope it continues. The government of Rwanda has taken credible steps and made further pledges to ensure the security of the refugees and is working with the international relief agencies to assist them upon their return. We are consulting with the governments of the region on the arrangements necessary for deployment of U.S. forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. is working closely with the Canadian and other governments, the U.  N. agencies and the humanitarian community to determine how we might most usefully participate in these humanitarian efforts and facilitate the repatriation of the refugees. Although considerable progress has been made, some outstanding questions concerning the organization and operation of the mission remain to be worked out. It is a complex effort and planning for an appropriate operation to follow the temporary multinational force must also begin right away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We applaud the effort that the Secretary-General's special envoy, the OAU and regional leaders, the European Union and other mediators are making to address the underlying political problems that must be resolved before the region can achieve true peace and stability. We urge all the parties in the region to cease hostilities directed at one another, cooperate with the mediation efforts, permit the flow of humanitarian assistance and support the secure repatriation of refugees. We also urge all parties to cooperate with the International Tribunal, which is authorized to deal with those persons responsible for the 1994 genocide.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The latest onslaught on the media by People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad) has been condemned by Minister of Post, Telecommunications and Broadcasting Jay Naidoo as worse than the threats against the media at the height of apartheid repression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The community-based organisation, which originally emerged in a bid to rid coloured townships of drug lords, has become more militant in recent months and has begun to target journalists whom it regards as the enemy alongside the drug lords and drug peddlers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pagad invited the media to a press conference (held in a mosque in Athlone, Cape Town) last Wednesday night, where they lashed out at journalists for almost two hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attacks on reporters stemmed from what Pagad alleged to be &quot; inaccuracies and lies&quot; in the press's coverage of the organisation's activities. The &quot;press conference&quot; was attended by more than 2 000 Pagad supporters who hissed and chanted periodically when they disagreed with the media and supported their leaders.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was addressed by four leaders of the organisation. All of them, except Pagad chief co-ordinator Aslam Toefy, wore scarves disguising their faces.  Most of their vitriol stemmed from the fact that the organisation had split into two and journalists continued to represent three expelled members - Farouk Jaffer, Ali Parker and Nadthmie Edries - as members of Pagad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also warned the media to stop focusing on the role Qibla - a militant Muslim organisation - played in supporting Pagad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naidoo said he was &quot;horrified&quot; at the treatment meted out to journalists: &quot; I consider it a humiliation not experienced even at the height of apartheid oppression to parade journalists before a hostile crowd and make threats against them and their newspapers. This is even more unacceptable in our new- born democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the minister responsible for broadcasting, I cannot accept threats against the media. It would be a disaster for our democracy to subordinate the media to the vested interests in our society, irrespective of who they are. The freedom of the press is a foundation of a democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are occasions when even I have strongly disagreed with the media.  That has never conferred on me the divine right to tell journalists what to write and editors what to print.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I call upon the sensible Pagad leaders to desist from threats as were made ... and to join the mainstream of South African society in consolidating the democratic values we have fought for as a nation and for which many patriots have paid the ultimate sacrifice,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalists were escorted inside the mosque at about 9.50am and seated in front of a table where the Pagad leaders were sitting. We were asked to identify ourselves by name and publication or broadcast medium before the press conference began. The names were repeated over the public address system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Below is an edited version of the Pagad press conference:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Pagad had to say ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE are giving The Cape Times and the Cape Argus until Friday to rectify all the damage they have done or have tried to do to Pagad. If not, on Sunday, Pagad will call for a boycott of The Cape Times and Cape Argus. (Cheers from the audience.) We will be fair to them tonight and our people can then decide if they should boycott or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media is responsible for creating misconceptions about Pagad. They have perceived a split in Pagad by indicating two different mosques where Pagad meets. The media has not related the support the groups have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Qibla continues to be a big question mark on Pagad's campaign. We say Pagad consists of people from various communities, Muslims, Christians, Catholics, Hindus. To prove this, if the media was honest and fair, it would show footage of people of other denominations praying at Pagad meetings on numerous occasions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do not persist with this Qibla link.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media persist in labelling the three expelled members of Pagad as the original leaders of Pagad, knowing full well they only joined four months back. Pagad started two years ago, and they weren't part of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question was put to our members in this very mosque, should they be expelled. The amirs (leaders) of our G-force (armed units) were unanimous that they should be expelled. Is it true? (Resounding yes, shouted from the crowd.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are saying to the media this is the last time we will discuss the expulsion with you. You are not to label those people as Pagad, you are not to refer to a &quot;moderate&quot; Pagad or an &quot;other&quot; Pagad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The perception the media sitting here is giving to the rest of the country is that Pagad is all about fundamentalism and violence. Stop playing with people's minds with your inaccuracies and lies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the media we say that there are no moderates in Islam in terms of its principles. You either take action to right a wrong or you stand back and do nothing. If that strikes you as fundamentalism, then we say thanks be to God that we are fundamentalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media has consistently given gangsters coverage on TV and in newspapers as righteous, law-abiding citizens. The media labels Pagad as violent, but then shows these people smoking dagga and displaying firearms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the last opportunity the media is being given to report wisely.  Pagad does not need the press, it does not need to adapt to your whims and fancies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you are going to be biased lean towards the victims. In World War II the media probably won the war before people went to battle. Here you have the same opportunity to play an important role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Look at the truth commission, the majority of whites are saying they never knew what happened in South Africa. The media must take responsibility for this. We will allow the media to ask questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: Would you like the media to ignore your campaign?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answer: It would be better for our campaign if the media ignored us instead of writing lies about our campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: Journalists and photographers have been experiencing threats right from the start of the campaign. If you want positive coverage, why threaten us?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answer: Yes, we had problems with the news media and instructed our security people to keep the media out. We did this because the media was working in the interests of the gangsters instead of getting involved in the process of uplifting humanity. What do you want us to do to such people, entertain them? We will all no longer tolerate them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Question: Why do you cover your faces with scarves?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answer: I used to cover my face and stopped because I found it was not necessary. If I put a bucket on my head or a scarf, the media will still see it necessary to print my name under a photo without my permission. If I die in this cause, I made my peace with Allah. I made a commitment and I will die in this commitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason we cover our faces is because certain people print pictures of us and give it to the gangsters. The brother who was killed, Faizal Rycliff, his picture was circularised. I may be next. You can kill me, but you will never kill Pagad.We cover our faces to protect our wives, children and brothers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We discovered the media and many people who have not been part of our demonstrations try to imply that because we cover our faces we have something to hide. We are dealing with people who work with cowardly tactics. If the dealers can't get you they go for your family. In a situation like this it is better that the enemy does not know you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cape Times editor Moegsien Williams said he did not take kindly to threats and did not think people should be allowed to make such threats. The Cape Times would not change its editorial policy at the behest of one organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What gives me sleepless nights is that if people make threats of this nature soon after you will find journalists are in physical danger if they are sent to cover Pagad events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Cape Times policy is to stand our ground but to talk. We will not cut off communications with Pagad,&quot; said Williams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Argus editor Shaun Johnson was not available to comment, but in his editorial on Friday, he called on Pagad to let &quot;reason prevail&quot;. He said his newspaper had no agenda against Pagad and was not a mouthpiece of any group.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The new South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board members await President Nelson Mandela's approval before they can take up their seats at the end of the month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this round of nominees, selected by a parliamentary committee, has raised eyebrows among some media observers who note the omission of people with an &quot;immense wealth of media experience&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The omissions include respected writer, Professor Fatima Meer; head of the Rhodes University journalism faculty, Guy Berger; former head of communications at the University of the North West, Professor Graham Addison; and vice-chancellor of the University of the North, Njabulo Ndebele.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SABC board is to oversee the running of the corporation and ensure that new policies are implemented by management. The relationship between the board's chair and the SABC's chief executive, therefore, needs to be cordial if the needs of both parties are to be met. However, it is understood that the relationship between board chair, Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri and SABC chief, executive Zwelakhe Sisulu, has been &quot;quite tempestous&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike the first board selection - which was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">headline news - the new selection was finalised with little media attention, even though meetings were open to the public. The reason for this, say observers, is that the role of the second SABC board is less important than that of the first which took over prior to the 1994 all-race elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first SABC board had a mammoth task to fulfil. It had to set the pace of transformation at the public broadcaster by introducing and approving affirmative action quotas, bring in 11 languages across the three channels and ensure that the SABC became representative of the South African public, rich in different cultures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task facing the new board, says one former member, is not as spectacular, &quot;but the new board will have to keep the SABC afloat as the public broadcaster is believed to be in financial dire straits. The new board, in some ways, has a more difficult task ahead.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight of the current SABC board members have been re-elected, including Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri, Ruth Teer-Tomaselli, Brigalia Bam, Anna Boshoff (the only Afrikaans-speaking person out of the seven Afrikaners who were on the old board) and Colin Kenneth Hickling (deputy chair), among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela can decide to cut down the selected 21 nominees to 16 or he can keep the total number of members selected as well as choose the chair and deputy chair. He also has to decide how long members will serve, but their term cannot exceed five years. The outgoing board served for three years.  Criticism has been levelled at the selection process and the panel members used. The previous selection panel consisted mainly of people from the legal profession whereas this year's selection took place with a good deal of political party intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allegations of political horse-trading have been made and one insider says a lot of &quot;shuffling took place at the last minute. Even the closing date for nominations was shifted at least three times allowing some political bods to make last-minute nominations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of the portfolio committee on communications of the national assembly, Sam Moeti, denies there was horse-trading, saying: &quot;This was an open and transparent process and anyone who was interested could attend.  Nominations were made by the public, a shortlist of 40-something names was compiled and it was further discussed and debated by the committee members who finally decided on 21 names which were handed over to the president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moeti was unable to furnish the Mail &amp; Guardian with the initial shortlist of names, of which Berger and Addison formed part, as Parliament is in recess.  It is, however, understood that the shortlist presented to Moeti's select committee was finalised by sub-committees which consisted of representatives from the major political parties. About 110 nominations were initially received by the committee, according to Moeti.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other new SABC board members are Francois Beukman, Lyndall Campher, Paul Davis, Frederik Kok, Mandla Langa, Professor Zanemvula Mda, Professor Mbulelo Mzamane, Litha Nyhonya, William Rowland, Masepeke Sekhukhuni, Sheila Sisulu (incumbent member), Reverend Gabriel Setiloane, Professor Jabulani Thembela (incumbent member), Christine Qunta, Allister Sparks (incumbent member) and Professor Paulus Zulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The incumbent board members who were omitted include Fikile Bam, Herman Bailey, Leon Bartel, Erra Cilliers, Arnold De Beer, Antonie Gildenhuys, Tsepo Khumbane, Fatima Meer, Khaba Mkhize, Njabulo Ndebele, Winston Ndungane, Abram Nkabinde and Pieter Potgieter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Finance and Fiscal Commission believes it is time the provinces raise their own revenue. Murphy Morobe spoke to Aspasia Karras about the commission's proposals</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PROVINCES must start playing a much stronger role in developing their own fiscus if they are to survive as executive entities. That is the message the Financial and Fiscal Commission (FFC) is trying to hammer home with increasing urgency in its reports to Parliament's standing committee on finance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the commission added more flesh to its proposals that provinces raise their own revenue. In the context of the administrative crises in two of the nine provinces, the Free State and the Eastern Cape, the commission may be fighting a much more complex case than just one for revenue expansion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Murphy Morobe, chairman of the commission, argues: &quot;The issues being raised are critical. We have to ask ourselves what form the state will and can take.  As the political actors proceed with giving meaning to the provisions of the new Constitution, so will the form and content of the state unravel. We as the commission have to be aware of these developments in order to remain relevant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission, an innovation of the interim Constitution, was appointed by the president. It advises and recommends approaches and solutions to the fiscal and financial requirements of the national, provincial and local governments through the relevant legislative authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission, says Morobe, has deliberately taken a low profile during the past two years in order closely to monitor and evaluate the terrain and the role it should play. In this time it has developed its &quot;currency&quot; - its consistent quality of work and legitimacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are precedents in other countries such as Australia and India, but their role, says Morobe, can vary from being &quot;indispensable to the system to being about as useful as a toy telephone&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission's principal task is to work out a way to split the pool of money between the provinces in a given year. First, the money is divided vertically, between ministeries and national functions; then allocated to the provinces in a horizontal split. The Constitution does not explicitly state that the FFC cannot play a role in the vertical split, but it has tended to tread carefully, as the issue is a political minefield, and is now driven by a new institution - the Budget Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Should we want to get more involved in the vertical split, we would have to play the role in such a way that we did not usurp the powers of the executive. After all, they have the first call in terms of determining the national interest. We cannot, however, be impassive to decisions made at that level; co-operative government impacts at all levels,&quot; says Morobe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trying to balance the needs of provinces against the constitutional requirements for equity in the context of a decentralised unitary state is indeed difficult, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new proposals are an attempt to address the problems of nine dependent provinces - significant imbalances in revenue-raising capacities and expenditure responsibilities, as well as growing deficits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is, however, the commission's role to point out that its proposals encompass the fiscal relationship envisaged by the Constitution. Only a systematic approach to these issues will prevent complete chaos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, it is talking about that most critical of concepts of co-operative governance, which Edward Ritchken from Ashoka, a non-governmental organisation dedicated to supporting innovation in social development, explains as: &quot;The process through which power and authority are exercised between and within the state and civil society around the allocation of resources. How antagonistic forces with material interests in the state and civil society forge alliances and enter into conflicts so as to access more resources to reinforce their power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission has concluded that a decentralised system can improve the allocation of resources, provided that sub- national governments are accountable to their electorates. Thus each province is given specific allocations determined at national level for education and health care, and is allowed to determine how it will spend the rest of its portion. The FFC has allowed for a five-year phasing-in process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Morobe elaborates: &quot;This is not just about numbers, it is not only an expenditure issue, but more importantly a revenue issue. If we continue to make significant transfers from the centre, in some years it will become difficult to justify the existence of provinces with an executive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An essential element of accountability is the responsibility of raising your own revenue. The issue is then not entirely about which way the cake will be split, but more importantly how provinces can be empowered to bake their own cakes. At present, the average province raises 4% of its expenditure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FFC, in its most recent presentation, has added some critical elements to the formula. The most controversial one is the proposal to allow provinces to raise their own revenues by imposing surcharges on personal income tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This does not mean that individual income tax rise, but rather that central government reduces its individual income tax rates by a few percentage points, in a phased process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, within the 25% capping on personal income tax, the provinces are given a few percentage points' leeway to levy as they choose.  This would then count as own revenue. Morobe argues that in this way richer provinces, which might otherwise feel done in by the redistributive elements of the formula, can compensate for the horizontal split.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the provinces have not been formally accorded taxing powers, the commission argues for a proxy for own revenue (a transitionally assigned surcharge) to equal the tax room given to each province in the first year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second element is the tax-capacity equalisation grant which seeks to compensate provinces for their different tax capacities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The grant will partially compensate for the different tax capacities and disparities in the various provinces,&quot; says Morobe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the FFC has begun a major programme to develop similar recommendations for local government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morobe concludes: &quot;First prize is a comprehensive government response to the proposals. But there has to be a strategy, which in the present period must also take into account the establishment of the National Council of Provinces and its role in the system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are many interrelated wholes, everybody has to be alive to chapter three of the Constitution, on co-operative government and the cross- functional issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - I would like to address some of the perceptions and misconceptions about the World Bank in South Africa that have surfaced recently, at times with a degree of emotional fervour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First, what is the World Bank and what are we doing in South Africa?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank is a co-operative bank owned by its member governments.  South Africa is both an owner and a client of the bank. It can call on the bank for whatever services it wants - advice, loans, training or guarantees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To date, the World Bank's role has consisted mainly of providing advisory services requested by agencies primarily within the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">True to its main objective of helping to reduce poverty in its client countries, the bank has worked with the Reconstruction and Development Programme office to produce a report on key indicators of poverty in South Africa, and co-financed a household living standards survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have also helped to finance a participatory poverty assessment undertaken by several non-governmental organisations (NGOs), as well as a poverty and inequality analysis under the auspices of the deputy president's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank has been one of several contributors to policy formulation in a number of areas, including macro-economics, health financing, urban basic services, land reform, small and medium enterprise development and education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have also provided a few small grants for early childhood development, increasing Aids awareness among teens and developing procurement reforms to assist small entrepreneurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government is currently discussing with bank staff the possibility of seeking World Bank financing for some programmes already envisaged or under way in the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to enhance industrial competitiveness and job creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Second, has the World Bank pressured the government into accepting our advice?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No. The policymakers with whom we have dealt seek advice from any number of sources, and draw their own conclusions as to the course South Africa should take in addressing its own development issues. Alec Erwin, the DTI minister, was recently quoted in the Mail &amp; Guardian as confirming this. The bank provides information on what has and has not worked in other countries, rather than a single policy prescription.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Third, is there a World Bank ideology?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again no. The World Bank is not a monolithic organisation - our staff come from a wide variety of fields: economics to anthropology, engineering to rural development. Complex issues of development do not lend themselves to a single simple answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank does, however, have policy views based on the international experience that we have had the opportunity to observe and analyse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This experience reveals that sustainable development can best be achieved when the government takes the lead in setting the rules for job-creating investment by the private sector, relying on the latter to provide the financial resources and the entrepreneurial capacity to make the most productive use of physical and human resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Governments across the globe have come to realise that private sector investment is required to generate the growth, the jobs and the infrastructure to improve the living standards of their populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody denies that economic growth is a prerequisite to improved living standards - no country in the world has managed to reduce poverty and income inequality if its economy is not growing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have also learnt that growth is not enough to ensure improved living standards of the poor. Countries must adopt policies and programmes that aim to ensure that benefits of growth are shared among their people. While this involves providing opportunities for people to improve their own welfare, it also requires efficient, equitable and sustainable provision of services.  Basic among these are health and education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, provision of education opportunities has been shown to be one of the most important, if not the most important, variable in translating growth into improved welfare. It is for this reason that the World Bank is the largest financier of social sector programmes - for health, nutrition and education - in the world, with an annual expenditure of over US$3-billion globally to these sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More and better quality education is key to South Africa's transformation into a society where all of its citizens benefit from any gains on the growth front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fourth, does the World Bank care more about policies or people?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government policy has a major impact on people, and so the World Bank is rightly concerned about policy issues. At the same time, much of the bank's financing goes directly into investments such as schools and clinics that provide tangible benefits to people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Development is about people - their access to opportunity, to a voice in the matters of state and community that affect them, and to sustainable livelihoods that allow them the dignity and responsibility of ensuring their own welfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most important question concerning the bank's role in South Africa is whether it contributes to actions that improve the well-being of South Africans, particularly those who have not benefited from the country's economic progress in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, is the cause of development better served by dialogue or by disassociation?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am baffled by the sentiments of some groups that contact with the bank constitutes contamination and should therefore be curtailed. The bank has learnt a lot from groups with differing views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exchanges with NGOs and civil society groups have had a direct and positive impact on its understanding of and sensitivity to social and environmental aspects of development programmes. We seek more dialogue, not less.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's easy to seek scapegoats for why policies or programmes do not succeed.  It's much harder to find solutions to achieving sustainable development for people. We have a responsibility to put our heads together and focus on the latter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The on-going row between book giant CNA Gallo and the newcomer to the industry, Facts &amp; Fiction, is set to flare up again, with the news that Facts &amp; Fiction is to take fresh allegations of unfair practices to the Competition Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The relationship between the two has been acrimonious ever since present Facts &amp; Fiction managing director Anthony Ward left the CNA stable last year to form his own company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ward told the Mail &amp; Guardian this week that he would be approaching the Competition Board with new evidence of unfair competitive behaviour by the CNA Gallo Group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ward said he had instructed attorneys to submit an application to the Competition Board to consider the entire structure of the book industry. &quot;The two applications (by Facts &amp; Fiction to the board) in the past have been met with very cursory treatment and we have instructed our lawyers to take a formal stance,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The books industry is worth an estimated R1,4-billion per annum. Facts &amp; Fiction and CNA compete head-on in the general book market, valued at R275- million, and CNA is estimated to control 95%. CNA Gallo lifted earnings by 5% to 5,8c a share, on turnover up 6% to R703-million in the six months to September 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CNA has about 320 shops nationwide and Exclusive Books, part of the CNA Gallo stable, has 10 specialist bookstores. Facts &amp; Fiction has seven outlets in Gauteng, with plans for another three in the Western Cape this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Industry insiders say Ward's company has not only managed to expand the market, but at the same time has captured 10% of CNA's share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason for his decision to approach the Competition Board was prompted by two levels of uncompetitive behaviour, says Ward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the retail level, we are faced with bullying tactics to prevent us from gaining retail space or by making it extremely frustrating to acquire any space. The other level is in terms of the whole book market where there is monopolistic and uncompetitive behaviour,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mirroring the allegations made to the Competition Board last year by Facts &amp; Fiction, Ward says he knows of two different instances where his competitor has made attempts to prevent his company from expanding into new premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">September last year saw the Competition Board informally investigate charges against CNA Gallo that it had allegedly tried to block Facts &amp; Fiction from gaining retail space in the Rosebank Mall, among other centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistant director Hennie Roux, from the board, said the charges had been investigated but it had found that the matters didn't warrant a formal investigation in terms of the Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ward describes the CNA Gallo Group as a bullyboy preventing everybody from playing fairly and squarely in the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He expressed concern at CNA's horizontal and vertical integration. Over the past 10 years Exclusive Books has gobbled up a large share of the independent booksellers, with the latest being Sheldons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CNA Gallo Group has the controlling share in a number of distribution, warehouse and publishing companies, including a stake in Trans South African Book Distributors (50%), Struik Holdings (46%) and Heinemann (50%).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is obvious that the situation is monopolistic in nature,&quot; Ward said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a number of occasions, he said, CNA Gallo had used delaying tactics in delivering books to his stores - an accusation backed up by other independent booksellers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CNA Gallo director Geoff Engel, however, refuted Ward's allegations of monopolistic behaviour or unfair competitive practices. He said the company had already stood the test by the Competition Board on whether it was behaving in a monopolistic fashion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The very fact that there are so many new entrants into the book trade and CNA's declining market share, says Engel, shows it is not hampering market growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would be happy to debate any specific points with Anthony, but he only levels broad accusations against us,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Engel, CNA Gallo does not have the clout to influence landlords' decisions on the allocation of retail space, and none of aits stores is an anchor tenant, as is the case with the large supermarkets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If anything needs to be considered, it's Facts &amp; Fiction's 50% ownership by Stocks &amp; Stocks - a major landlord.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though CNA Gallo might be vertically integrated into the market, Engel says it does not have control over the board of directors or management of these companies (in distribution etc) - that rests with the partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Technically we have no control over these companies,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the only time CNA Gallo ever holds back stock is owing to commercial considerations, such as when a client is overdue on their accounts or over their credit limit, says Engel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the slanging match continues, both sides welcome the chance to see the matter finally settled by the Competition Board.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - British Aerospace (BAe), a front runner in the bidding to replace the ageing Impala trainers, is taking a 20% stake in Advanced Technologies &amp; Engineering (ATE), which supplies the integrated avionics systems for the South African Air Force's Pilatus &quot;Astra&quot; trainer and the Rooivalk attack helicopter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The value of the shareholding was not disclosed, but Alan MacDonald, BAe managing director responsible for the Asean and Southern African regions, said the move fitted perfectly with the British company's aim of building global partnerships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've been talking to ATE for about three years; the synergies are obvious.  A memorandum of understanding was signed last week, with the intention that we will help boost the company's international marketing, as well as its skills base by giving them advanced projects to work on.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BAe will transfer substantial contracts for systems integration work to its South African partners. It is also open to further investment: &quot;ATE generates much of its investment itself, but if the need arises, we will support expansion with more capital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both MacDonald and Jean-Marc Pizano, head of ATE, stressed the opportunities the alliance will provide for black empowerment and affirmative action. &quot;Any contract we receive,&quot; says Pizano, &quot;can lead to a cascade of business across the breadth and depth of our extensive supplier network, which is mostly South African,&quot; thereby boosting employment opportunities and skills transference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MacDonald was keen to stress that the link- up was not related to its bid to secure the air force contract to replace the Impala aircraft, due to be finalised by March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our aim is not just to sell products to this country but also to be good corporate citizens. Obviously we hope we will win the contract, but we also believe in this country and want to be part of its future growth.&quot; He warned of the dangers of sidelining the defence industry, despite the urgency of concentrating on more fundamental needs such as health and education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South Africa has tremendous capabilities, but is in danger of losing those skills and technological advances built up over so many years, which could undermine the industry. And the export opportunities are tremendous. So we plan to be part of that growth.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Eskom's Pension and Provident Fund is considering a major shake-up of its R2- billion property portfolio, according to confidential documents leaked to the Mail &amp; Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a strategic workshop held earlier this month by the fund's investment committee, it was proposed to dispose of a sizeable share of its property investments. In a move that is bound to catch many property analysts flat- footed, the fund is considering selling off portions of its investments in several prime retail outlets and offices in Gauteng.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But any proposed sale by the fund could encounter resistance from the unions, which feel Eskom is disregarding the National Framework Agreement (NFA) - an understanding between the government and labour on the restructuring of state assets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This view is not shared by Eskom management. An Eskom representative said it had on numerous occasions stated that, although not a party to the NFA, it would not unilaterally proceed with initiatives that fell within the scope of the NFA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa's assistant general secretary Mbuyi Ngwenda says the union has long argued that matters of a serious nature, such as the disposal of assets, should be discussed in the restructuring transformation committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eskom contends that the fund is a separate legal entity that receives its mandate from its 49 000 members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It plans &quot;actively to promote disposal of&quot; Debruynpark in the Pretoria CBD, which it says is high risk and has a massive vacancy rate, and the Cresta shopping centre, where the fund is considering reducing its shareholding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fund's 12,5% stake in the troubled Sandton Square is also under consideration for disposal, as is its 25% investment in the Sandton Consortium and the adjoining hotels and offices, which it says it may need to dilute in order to participate in further capital expansion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the fund's 20 property investments, 11 are under review for sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the document, property totals 18%, or R2-billion, of the pension fund's assets at present market values. It had achieved an outstanding 32,5% return on investments by the financial year-end in June 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there are a number of issues hampering the fund's growth, according to the document. These include a lack of new capital and the dismal future of regional shopping centres, which it says is a mature and saturated market in the Gauteng area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fund is forecasting up to R1,2-billion in capital requirements for a number of new investment opportunities, to be funded from the proceeds of the proposed sale of its assets. The two most significant are the Sandton Consortium and Pavilion initiatives in Johannesburg and Durban respectively, which the fund says would need an expected R900-million capital injection over the next three years, to fund retail expansion, casino and offices and a convention centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee said the fund needed to consider four broad future investment strategies: focusing on existing retail and prime offices; swapping locally with like- minded institutions to diversify risk; diversifying abroad through appropriate investment vehicles and pursuing Reconstruction and Development Programme initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Adriaan Nieman, property general manager of the pension fund, the document should be seen in the context of normal strategic planning. It is an overview of the property portfolio's current profile and investment philosophies and criteria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nieman said the board of trustees was fully representative of all shareholders, including unions, and would consider carefully the consequences of the investment committee's recommendations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not believe it would be in the public's interest to reveal the content of our confidential discussions. This leak could have a material impact on the value of the property portfolio,&quot; Nieman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Nieman, those assets under consideration for sale only comprise 3% of the total value of the fund's investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not want the portfolio to exceed the maximum of 18% of the fund's investments and we need to focus on the future major growth nodes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a two-to-five year strategic plan and we want to expand and diversify the portfolio,&quot; Nieman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arthur Els, an actuary for Ginsberg Malan &amp; Carsans, said he expected the move might be a result of the Katz Commission's decision to levy a 17% tax on income and rental profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most pension funds have less than 10% of their investments in property because of the depressed property markets and the new tax,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Syfrets property analyst thought it was a good idea that Eskom withdraw from the property market but said it might struggle to achieve its goal. He expects the Eskom pension fund to take a capital loss on its investments, especially since many have been overvalued.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goma - Ahead of heavy fighting that erupted near Goma in Eastern Zaire on November 14, United Nations relief agencies have reached an aid-distribution agreement with rebel leaders who control the area, a UN official said here on November 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 10-point agreement with rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila did not mean the UN recognised rebel authority in eastern Zaire or was interfering in Zairean domestic affairs, Ben Parker of the UN humanitarian affairs department said, adding that UN officials still had to resolve with Kinshasa the problem of distributing aid from across the border in Rwanda and Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal comes after Zairean authorities warned on November 11 that agencies would be barred from operating on Zairean soil if they dealt with rebel forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information Minister Boguo Makeli said that international organisations supporting the rebel alliance would be abetting &quot;treason&quot;, although there were a number of issues still to be resolved, the major one being the ability to receive permission from Kinshasa to deliver goods across the border from the east.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The aid agencies pulled out of Goma on October 24 under mortar and machine- gun fire as rebels of Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire fought retreating Zairean troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokeswoman for the UN's World Food Programme (WFP), Michelle Quintaglie, said in Nairobi that the organisation had food stocks on the border with Zaire and would be able to move in within &quot;12 to 72 hours&quot; of getting the go- ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the first two truckloads of food the agency moved into Goma on November 11 remained undistributed overnight the following day under rebel guard in a stadium in the town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 1.2 million refugees -- Hutus who fled civil strife in Rwanda and Burundi -- as well as thousands of displaced Zaireans have been out of the reach of aid agencies since they fled their camps ahead of the rebel advance which began a month ago on October 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some aid agencies estimate that many thousands will already have died from hunger, thirst and deceases in the inhospitable Zairean interior by the time they are found in the ongoing frantic search.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But once they are found, to take in the minimum of 500 tonnes of food a day needed for the estimated more than 1 million refugees would require 32 flights a day of huge C130 transport planes and a minimum of 60 trucks on the ground to ferry the food over poor roads to the east.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also fears that cholera could quickly kill up to 150,000 of them unless they have access to good quality drinking water in the next few days, the International Federation of Red Cross Societies announced from Geneva on November 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is an &quot;enormous possibility&quot; of an epidemic, said Piero Calvi- Parisetti, head of a Red Cross working group on the Great Lakes region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we are unable to provide them with good quality water, we could lose 100,000 to 150,000 people very quickly,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The treatment for cholera is simply water to rehydrate the victim, but it needs to be of good quality, Calvi-Parisetti stressed. Rain water is not up to scratch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local Red Cross offices in Zaire and Rwanda are unable to help most of the hundreds of thousands of refugees dispersed and in distress around Lake Kivu, since their food stocks have run out, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Red Cross Federation is in talks with Zairean authorities in Kinshasa to obtain approval to fly to a dozen airports west of Goma and Bukavu, but despite verbal assurances, written confirmation was not yet in hand by the time of going to press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As long as written approval is lacking, flights to these airports will be too dangerous, Calvi-Parisetti said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kinshasa - Residents of the Zairean capital fearing new unrest in the city stayed off the streets on November 12, the day set in a students' ultimatum for Prime Minister Joseph Kengo Wa Dondo to step down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students from the University of Kinshasa set the ultimatum, pressing Kengo to accept the blame for the Zairean army's military defeat at the hands of Tutsi rebels who have taken control of eastern Zaire's two provinces of North and South Kivu, triggering the flight of some 1.2 million refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite a ban on rallies, they demonstrated to &quot;support the war effort and the Zairean armed forces&quot; but especially for &quot;the resignation of the prime minister,&quot; said to be of Zairean and Tutsi parentage.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers here believe that the students are being manipulated by opposition parties, who like the students are more concerned with ousting Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, currently convalescing in the French city of Nice from a recent prostate cancer operation in Switzerland, than in military successes in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu told South African Vice-President Thabo Mbeki in Nice on November 12 that his condition since the operation is not yet fit, and that he would return to Switzerland for medical check-up before returning home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Kengo, who has been prime minister since June 1994, is in fact highly regarded in the West, having managed to restore a certain degree of stability to Zaire, which was wracked by unrest in 1991 and 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The students' ultimatum that he step down or &quot;face the consequences&quot; -- while unlikely to succeed -- has nevertheless created a tense climate in the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The streets were also deserted all day on November 11 after students appealed for a day of inaction, calling on people to stay at home, not to work, nor drive around town or do business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A week earlier, the students encountered little resistance when they commandeered hundreds of vehicles for a parade that had been banned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security forces' passivity rekindled fears of new unrest among residents who had begun to breathe easier since Kengo came to power two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fear of new student unrest has led France to deploy &quot;as a precaution&quot; some 120 troops in Brazzaville, the Congolese capital across the Zaire River from Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France's ambassador to Congo, Raymond Cesaire, sought to play down the deployment, saying it was not linked to the situation in Zaire but was &quot;part of an ordinary rotation in the countries of the sub- region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any intervention by the troops in Zaire would require a request or agreement by the Zairean government, informed sources noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Belgian and French troops intervened, with Mobutu's blessing in 1991 to help quell riots over government corruption and repression and to protect more than 20,000 foreigners living throughout Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then in 1993, after serious mutinies in Kinshasa, Mobutu allowed only a small French contingent to intervene while banning Belgian forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">French troops came to Kinshasa from Brazzaville to recover the remains of French ambassador Philippe Bernard, who was killed in his office by automatic weapons fire in circumstances that have still not been explained, during intense fighting between Zairean soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The troops also guarded the ambassador's residence, where several hundred foreigners took refuge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upwards of 6,000 foreigners living in Kinshasa, most of them longtime residents, still have vivid memories of these events. Some Europeans here expressed relief at the proximity of the French troops.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madrid - Four Spanish missionaries have been killed in Bukavu, the capital of south Kivu region in eastern Zaire, the Marxist order announced here on November 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman of the order Adolfo Varas said: &quot;We consider it certain that the four died,&quot; adding that they were killed overnight on October 7 near Bukavu, capital of South Kivu province, but their bodies have not been recovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The missionary order first announced the incident on November 8, when it said that at least three of its missionaries had been killed in Bukavu the previous day, although it said it had not received 100 per cent confirmation or the incident.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Spanish Foreign Ministry has not received confirmation of the deaths through its own information channels, a ministry spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 50 Spaniards, mostly clergy, are still in the conflict zone in Eastern Zaire, and most want to stay on in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bukavu is among a number of eastern Zairean towns seized in the previous week by Zairean Tutsi rebels, who have lived in Zaire for nearly 200 years and at first said they were fighting for recognition as Zairean citizens, but have since said they want to topple President Mobutu Sese Seko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 29, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Bukavu, Monsignor Christophe Munzi Hirwa, was also killed in the Bukavu region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Munzi Hirwa, a Jesuit, was &quot;caught in an ambush&quot; in the troubled eastern Zairean town of Bukavu, and his body was found in the early hours of October 30, according to an announcement that was later confirmed in Madrid by Igancio Velasco, director of the Bureau of International Cooperation of the Order of Jesus, as the Jesuits are formally known.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Vatican, a papal spokesman said Pope John Paul II had been &quot;greatly saddened&quot; to learn of Hirwa's death, only hours after the pontiff had &quot;begged&quot; the international community to help the Rwandan, Burundian and Zairean populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I pray that the guns fall silent, that the hatred and ethnic conflicts cease, that we stop this shameful killing of human beings and seek the path of negotiation,&quot; he told a gathering of the Catholic faithful in St. Peter's square.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to reports, Munzi Hirwa had before his death written to the United Nations accusing Rwanda and Uganda of waging war in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writing to the UN mission in Bukavu, Munzi Hirwa had accused Rwanda of using the Banyamulenge Tutsi rebels to seize power in Zaire, its much larger neighbour in the Great Lakes region, according to the Belgian News Agency, Belga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Munzi Hirwa had said the conflict in the Kivu area of Zaire was &quot;a war by Uganda and Rwanda against Zaire,&quot; said Belga, quoting from a copy of the letter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had asked the United Nations to persuade the United States and other countries which he accused of supporting the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Army to act &quot;to stop this war of incalculable human damage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, news of the killing of the archbishop came as Pope John Paul II was appealing urgently to the world community to help the central African people affected by intense fighting in eastern Zaire, calling the situation there a &quot;catastrophe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As archbishop, Munzi Hirwa would have been the Vatican's chief representative in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire has 17.32 million Roman Catholics among its 43.8 million people, according to 1992 and 1994 figures. Christianity has existed in the vast African nation since Belgian colonial days, which ended with independence in June 1960.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ROME, Italy (PANA) - The heads of the African Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank are opposed to agricultural subsidies currently being applied by governments in Africa and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In plenary Thursday at the ongoing World Food Summit, the presidents of both institutions said subsidies had contributed to lower incomes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently well-intentioned but misguided practices&quot; aimed at cheap food prices for urban consumers through subsidies had only exacerbated the problem of lower farm incomes, ADB President Omar Kabbaj said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsidies, he added, &quot;contributed to the marginalization of the rural economy and to declines in the income and welfare of rural dwellers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And World Bank President James Wolfensohn told a news conference &quot;no country, in the long term, can live with subsidies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier he told world leaders at the summit that governments &quot;should reduce heavy intervention in the rural economy and concentrate on creating an economic and regulatory environment that fosters agricultural growth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Kabbaj and Wolfensohn said that the reduction of subsidies tended to nudge farmers to areas which are more efficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To compliment this, both banks have adopted new approaches to rid the poor countries of the worst types of poverty, providing mocro-financing to allow for easy credit for farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabbaj said ADB provides micro-credit to poor and vulnerable groups and has been giving credit to national and sub-regional development finance bodies so they could, in turn, lend to small and medium-scale enterprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both banks have also been working with or have policies in place to collaborate with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), who have considerable experience in implementing poverty alleviation programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will be making further strides in this area, with the finalization of a new micro-enterprise policy which will set the framework for extending appropriate credit to the poorest groups, using financial intermediaries such as NGOs and other grassroots organizations,&quot; Kabbaj said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have initially set aside some 20 million dollars (U.S) for this type of support.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria airways has sacked 250 more workers less than one year after firing 720 others as part of efforts to improve the efficiency of the financially troubled national carrier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The airline's spokesman, Chris Aligbe, said in a statement in Lagos Thursday that the 250 were sacked either for &quot;indiscipline or declining productivity, excessive leave and absenteeism.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sack &quot;cuts across the senior and junior cadre&quot; of staff, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A combination of debt burden and maintenance problem has reduced the airway's fleet from about 20 aircraft several years ago to only four operational today. Some planes were seized by creditors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The estimated 4,000 work force eats deep into the airline's scarce revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its managing director, Group Capt. Peter Gana, has promised to sanitize the organisation by instilling discipline and reducing the work force to the barest minimum.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said at a news briefing in Kinshasa on Thursday that the crisis in eastern Zaire was partly caused by the non-respect of the decisions of a national conference held four years ago by the political class.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference named Tshisekedi Prime Minister but the latter was relieved of the post months later by Mobutu.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to a question on the suggestion that a separate territory to be known as Hutuland be carved out as a way of solving the ethnic problem in Burundi and Rwanda, he said &quot;Zairians will never accept to surrender a square millimeter of their territory.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They will continue to be remembered for their great attributes as motivators, disciplined visionaries and perfect examples that we can always be,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambian President Frederick Chiluba has told South African President Nelson Mandela that it is &quot;impossible&quot; to postpone Monday's elections since the 11 opposition parties participating in the elections have opposed postponement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his letter, dated 14 Nov. to Mandela which was made available to PANA Friday, he also said that the proposition to postpone the elections was totally impossible because of the &quot;astronomical&quot; costs incurred spent by the participating parties and in view of limited resources.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Postponement of the elections scheduled for next monday 18 November, 1996 is a totally impossible proposition which the principal opposition parties taking part in the elections have also said they will not accept,&quot; part of the letter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba maintained there is no threat to the internal security and stability to warrant a draconian move like a state of emergency, as suggested, to facilitate the postponement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela early this week held private consultations with Chiluba in Pretoria.  He later sent South African constitutional court judge Richard Goldstone to explore possibilities of postponing the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition Zambia Democratic Congress, (ZDC) which is one of the political parties taking part in the elections, confirmed to PANA that it had refused to accept the suggestion of postponing the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not for the idea of extending the elections,&quot; said the party's general secretary, Derrick Chitala. &quot;We had made it clear that we would only agree if we were compensated the money spent on elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former President Kenneth Kaunda's United National Independence Party and seven other minor opposition parties are boycotting the elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - (IRIN Note: This document is in no way intended to be comprehensive, but offers basic information thought to be useful to the humanitarian community during the present crisis.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INTRODUCTION:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire -- Africa's third largest nation -- is located at the heart of the continent, and has become ever more embroiled in chaos since independence from Belgium in 1960. The sprawling country has vast mineral reserves, and regions such as copper-rich Shaba and diamond-rich Kasai are virtually autonomous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home to 1.2 million Rwandan and Burundian Hutu refugees in the east, Zaire is now wracked by a revolt in the eastern Kivu region led by Tutsi rebels, widely believed to be backed by soldiers from the Tutsi-led Rwandan army.  Refugees are again on the move, and the rag-tag Zairean army's flight from the rebels, coupled with President Mobutu's prolonged absence from the country, has demonstrated Kinshasa's growing inability to control events in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BASIC FACTS:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Area - 2,344,885 sq km, 905,365 sq miles</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">October 1990: Mobutu announces that full multi-party system will come into force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1991: Opposition parties come together under the umbrella of Union Sacree and take part in a national conference in August aimed at drafting a new constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">December 1992: National conference dissolves itself, and is succeeded by a 453-member High Council of the Republic (HCR) with Archbishop Monsengwo as its president. It declares Etienne Tshisekedi as prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">March 1993: Mobutu attempts to reassert political authority by convening a special &quot;conclave&quot; of political forces to debate the country's future, and a parallel administration is formed with Faustin Birindwa as prime minister.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">October 1996: Concern mounts over Mobutu's health and his leadership, as he prolongs his stay in Switzerland, and fighting between rebel ethnic Tutsis in South Kivu - known as Banyamulenge - and the Zairean armed forces engulfs the eastern Zaire region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">November 1996: Great Lakes region faced with another refugee crisis after Banyamulenge rebels oust Zairean soldiers in Bukavu, Goma and Uvira regions and thousands of people are again on the move. Kinshasa effectively rudderless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOME OF THE KEY PLAYERS:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MOBUTU SESE SEKO - Zaire's strongman president for three decades and arguably the one symbol of national unity, Mobutu has been absent since August when he had surgery for prostate cancer in Switzerland. He is currently in France. He came to power in a military coup in 1965 and has ruled since with cunning. In 1990 he embraced democratic reforms, but the transition has dragged on and Zaire has yet to hold elections. Mobutu has a magnificent palace at his home of Gbadolite, deep in the jungle of northern Equateur district. In recent years he has spent most of his time there, rarely visiting the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KENGO WA DONDO - Zaire's half-Polish, part-Rwandan prime minister is appreciated by the West for his willingness to reform the corrupt economy. A wealthy businessman, he was a prime minister under Mobutu's one-party system but during the transition to democracy moved towards the opposition ranks.  The transitional parliament elected him prime minister in 1994 as a candidate from the opposition acceptable to Mobutu's supporters, who are in the majority. His attempts to implement economic reforms reflected well on Mobutu, shunned by the West for human rights abuses and lack of democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ELUKI MONGA AUNDU - As army chief of staff, General Eluki commands Zaire's biggest armed force, a ragged body estimated at around 25,000, forced by low pay to survive on what they can forage or extract from the civilian population. Eluki is from the same Equateur region as Mobutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BARAMOTO KPAMA - General Baramoto commands the civil guard, most feared of the military forces by the civilian population. Well-trained and fed compared to the regular army, it is used to put down local disturbances and also has a combat role. Baramoto comes from the same Ngbandi ethnic group as Mobutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NZIMBI NGBALE - Commanding general of the Special Presidential Division (DSP), the most disciplined, best-paid and professional of Zaire's fighting forces. Their specific duty is to assure the president's security but includes defending vital national interests. Employed by the United Nations, a contingent of the DSP was used to guard Rwandan Hutu refugee camps in the east. Nzimbi has close family ties to Mobutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMANDA WA KAMANDA - A career politician, the interior minister is a centrist allied with Kengo, having once been close to Mobutu. In 1972 he was elected assistant secretary-general of the Organisation of African Unity.  Kamanda has been outspoken on getting Hutu refugees to return home, as both foreign minister and now interior minister. He is from the western Bandundu district close to the capital Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ETIENNE TSHISEKEDI - A onetime friend of Mobutu, Tshisekedi is now the main figure in radical political opposition to the president. He was arrested on numerous occasions before democratic reforms began. As prime minister elected by a national conference in 1992, he was shunted aside in favour of a Mobutu appointee in 1993. Tshisekedi refuses to accept Kengo's 1994 election and claims the job for himself. The opposition, and even Tshisekedi's own Union for Democracy and Social Progress Party, is divided. His origins lie in the diamond-rich Kasai region of central Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NGUZA KARL-I-BOND - Veteran opposition leader and political survivor, he has been everything from first commissioner (prime minister) under Mobutu's one-party state to a prisoner on death row. A former ambassador to the United States, he was a major player in the early days of the democratic transition.  He leads the Union of Federalists and Independent Republicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAURENT KABILA - A former Marxist who heads the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL), dominated by the Banyamulenge ethnic Tutsis now controlling much of eastern Zaire. He says the aim of the alliance is to put an end to Mobutu's rule and eradicate corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ADFL, formed on 18 October 1996 at Lemera, South Kivu, is composed of:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Parti de la Revolution Populaire, a Marxist-oriented group founded in the 1960s battling the government in the east. Prominent leader: Laurent Kabila, from Shaba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* &quot;Kissasse&quot; rebels, who follow military commander Andre Kissasse. They include fighters from the eastern Zaire Nande tribe and Kasai. Party: Conseil National de Resistance pour la Democratie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Mouvement Revolutionnaire pour la Liberation du Zaire. Prominent leader: Nindaga Masusu, reportedly of Bashi ethnicity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Zairean Banyamulenge Tutsis from South Kivu province, joined by the Banyarwanda Tutsis from North Kivu. Party: Alliance Democratique des Peuples (ADP), leader: Deo/Douglas Bugera (from Rutshuru), prominent member, Muller Ruhimbika (Banyamulenge).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, fighters within the rebel forces may include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Ethnic Luba dissidents from southeastern Kasai province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Shaba fighters drawn from 500,000 people who fled government terror in the southeastern Shaba province to Kasai in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Zairean army deserters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Elements from the Mai-Mai and Bangilima North Kivu Zairean militia - although they have reportedly fought on both sides of the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ECONOMY:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Main Exports - Copper, coffee, diamonds, cobalt, crude oil; mainly to the USA, EU and Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Main Imports - Refined petroleum products, heavy machinery, food and fuels; mainly from the USA, EU and Japan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - As thousands of people resumed their trek across the border into Rwanda this morning, doubts were cast on the need to deploy a multi-national force in Eastern Zaire to aid refugees. As of last night a human tide of some 200,000 people had crossed the border into Rwanda. UNHCR believes that as many as 300,000 more may be on the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rwandan Government and Zairean rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila both said on Saturday that there was no longer any need for sending an international force to Zaire. Kabila, apparent head of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire, said the &quot;job they wanted to do here has been done by us&quot;. On Thursday rebels ousted militia and former Rwandan troops from the camp of Mugunga, 15 kilometres west of Goma.  This sparked off the mass exodus back to Rwanda. The US Government has said that it will continue to prepare for an international humanitarian mission to Zaire but that it will not make a final decision for several days. The European Commissioner for humanitarian aid, Emma Bonino also cast doubt on the usefulness of a multi-national force if &quot;it could not disarm warring factions&quot;. Bonino blames &quot;American reservations&quot; for delaying the decision - approved by the UN Security Council on Friday - to deploy the Canadian-led force.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada, meanwhile, has voiced determination to proceed with the mission. &quot; Planning continues on track&quot;, said Foreign Ministry spokesman, John Bell. He said that despite the mass return of refugees, the humanitarian crisis remained. Hundreds of thousands of people still in Zaire were stranded without food, water or shelter. Yesterday AFP reported that planes carrying 24 Canadian soldiers were held up for some hours in Kenya pending the permission of the Rwandan Government to land in Kigali. The soldiers had been deployed to install the Goma headquarters for the Canadian commander of the force, General Maurice Baril. General Baril is due to travel to Germany on Tuesday to meet other military officials involved in the mission.  This morning aid agencies were struggling to cope with the sheer mass of people arriving at the border. UNHCR has described the return as the &quot;largest and swiftest&quot; homeward movement of refugees in memory and said that it had mobilised all available staff and resources to meet the needs of the returning refugees. Most new arrivals appear to heading towards the official transit posts in and around Gisenyi but aid workers report that streams of refugees can be seen in the hills heading directly for their former homes.  The first 50 buses laid on by UNHCR were due to start ferrying people to their home villages this morning from Nkamira some 21 kilometres from the Gisenyi border crossing. Doctors treating sick children said that their biggest problem so far was diahorrhea and vomiting. A Merlin official said that many children were badly dehydrated and in a state of collapse. In Goma, relief officials said that they feared a cholera epidemic. Some 25 confirmed cases amongst refugees have now been reported from the Goma hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attempts are being made to provide high protein biscuits to the new arrivals but aid workers in Gisenyi said that distribution is difficult because of the extraordinary numbers of people. WFP announced yesterday that it would begin to distribute food rations once the refugees are back in their home communes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata said yesterday that she was delighted at the mass return. She stressed, however, that the big challenge for the international community and UNHCR was &quot;to reintegrate returnees in conditions of security&quot;. Ogata said that UN Human Rights Field Officers would work closely with UNHCR Field Officers to monitor the returnees in their home communes. AFP has reported that observers in Gisenyi have said that they are concerned about the strain of the mass return on Rwanda's fragile political foundations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch/Africa yesterday stressed that any new camps established for refugees in Zaire must exclude anyone bearing arms, including the ex-FAR and militia. Failing to separate out armed elements, said the organisation, would simply repeat the mistakes made in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far there has been no agreement on access to the 500,000 or so Rwandan and Burundian refugees scattered in south Kivu. Aid workers are reported today to be continuing attempts to reach them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Renewed fighting broke out yesterday between rebels and Zairean forces around Sake northwest of Goma yesterday and there was speculation that Zairean troops may be planning a new offensive in the next few days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi's leader Pierre Buyoya said Saturday that Hutu rebels displaced by the fighting in eastern Zaire were travelling across Burundi and setting up bases in Tanzania. Buyoya said that he was concerned about the clouded relations between Burundi and Dar-es-Salaam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief agencies in Burundi, meanwhile, sent food, medecines, plastic sheeting, blankets, jerrycans and water purification tablets to Cibitoke province - the scene of some of the most intense fighting in Burundi - on Saturday for the 20,000 or so Burundians who have returned to the northwest from eastern Zaire. UNHCR reported that only one refugee turned up at Gatumba transit camp near Bujumbura yesterday. Altogether some 13,500 have crossed at Gatumba and most have been resettled in their home communes. Up to 20,000 more have returned spontaneously to Cibitoke.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - For the very top echelon of the Nigeria Police Force, one assignment has become very urgent in t he past few weeks: Tracking down a little know man by name Chris Iyayi. Until recently a zonal head of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, the environmentalist is believed to be currently cooling his feet in England after allegedly setting the Central Bank of Nigeria back by over N600 million.  CBN's loss, according to police investigation, was Pinacle Commerical Bank's gain. The bank's executive chairman before now was Macaulay Iyayi, elder brother to FEPA's Iyayi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources informed Theweek that Sani Abacha, the head of state, has waded into the matter by instructing the Sam Aluko led National Economic Intelligence Committee to dig into the issue. The head of state is said to have also instructed Ibrahim Coomasie, the inspector-general of police, to do everything possible to bring all the culprits to book. In compliance with the head of state's directive, the Federal Investigation and Intelligence Bureau is said to have been liaising with Interpol, the international police, on how the younger Iyayi could be repatriated back home to face the law.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information available to Theweek indicates that the scheme to defraud the CBN by the Iyayis may have started far back as July 1994 when Chris started the zonal office of FEPA in Port Harcourt. He had rented Pinacle Commercial Bank's property for office and residential purposes. With that, a business relationship was effectively established between FEPA and Pinacle, where Macaulay, the elder brother, held sway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For FEPA to be able to carry out its task of a pollution-free environment, an account was opened with the Port Harcourt zonal office of the Central Bank.  FEPA's Port Harcourt zone account number with CBN was 485. For this account, according to Evans Aina, director-general of the agency, believed to have been detained, the mandate given by the headquarters to CBN is that the limit of authority of Iyayi and his co-signatory is N50,000. Tony Ede, CBN's chief image maker, however told Theweek that no such mandate was given to the bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whoever may be telling the truth the Iyayis soon set to work in Port Harcourt. Documents available to Theweek showed that without clearance from the headquarters, the younger Iyayi between December 12, 1993 and August 7, 1996 issued a total of nine CBN cheques amounting to N1.115 billion in favour of Pinacle Commercial Bank. Further investigation revealed that the CBN actually credited eight of these cheques, amounting to N620 million, to Pinacle while the last one for N495 million was stopped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pinacle Commercial Bank, in whose favour the &quot;dud cheques&quot; were drawn, presented them to the CBN through the clearing house process and received full value for the eight cheques. By the time the CBN woke up from its slumber, Pinacle, through gross abuse of the clearing process, had overdrawn on its account to the tune of N786 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giving the background to the big scam, Paul Ogwuma, CBN governor, in a letter to Abacha, dated September 9, 1996 said that &quot;CBN in Port Harcourt unwittingly collaborated with FEPA officials while believing that he was assisting a federal government agency in a legitimate transaction.&quot; That may be so. But the manner in which the deal went raises some questions which could lead an investigator to concluded that rather than collaborate unwittingly, Udanoh, the CBN Branch Controller, may have actively abetted a crime. For one, it baffles observers that after Iyayi had issued two of such cheques, each for N100 million on the 12th and 15th December 1995, and drawn by PCB, Udanoh wrote to FEPA's Iyayi last January 10, asking him to explain issues relating to cheques. What this implies is that by last January, Iyayi's cheques had become suspect. It is however surprising that between that month and April 8, six similar cheques to the tune of N420 million issued by Iyayi were cleared by PCB at CBN. This Udanoh acknowledged in his letter to Iyayi dated June 3, 1996. Said he: &quot;we are surprised that from the date of our letter under reference January 10 to April 8, 1996, we have received some more of your cheques amounting to N420 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The million naira question is: why did CBN honour those Cheques? The question becomes more relevant when it is realised that FEPA never had up to N2 million at a time in its account 485. The view in financial circles is that it was not enough that, as he told the CBN, Chris Iyayi expected transfers to the account from FEPA headquarters. As it turned out, no money came from FEPA headquarters, as none was promised Iyayi. Financial experts are surprised that the CBN acted only after the ninth cheque for N495 million was to be drawn by Port Harcourt FEPA on August 8 in favour of PCB.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In these deals, Aina may have been left to hold the short end of the stick.  Although available evidence does not indicate that he connived with Iyayi, Aina's problem may not be over very soon. In his letter of October 12, 1996 to Idris Gidado, Secretary to the Government of the Federation and chairman, FEPA Governing Council, Aina had made reference to Abacha's circular which states that directors-general will be held responsible for any financial loss in their establishments. With this circular, it may not matter whether Aina was an accomplice or not, since it has proved that FEPA as an institution has been used to defraud the federal government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is more, Aina's claim that the agency's mandate to CBN clearly stipulates that no zonal office can sign or draw any cheque above N50,000 limit remains a contentious issue. In a letter titled &quot;Change of Authorised Operators/Endorsers Signatories&quot; addressed to the Senior Manager, Mandate Office, Banking Operations Department, Central Bank of Nigeria, FEPA had appointed A.K. Yerima, Chris Iyayi, O.O. Sode and K. Ogbara as signatories to account 485. Two of the signatories, one of which must be zonal head, that is Iyayi, were authorised to sign cheques. Only Iyayi and Yerima had their signature specimens in the document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter dated June 24, 1994 and typed on a plain sheet and not the agency's letterhead paper, also stated in part that for N50,000 and below, any two signatories could sign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If this letter is genuine, what it means is that contrary to Aina's claim, Yerima and Iyayi could sign for an amount over N50,000. By press time, Theweek could not determine the whereabouts of Yerima.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Iyayi, apparently aware of the seriousness of the issue at hand, has taken off. Interestingly, he is not denying issuing the dubious cheques.  While replying to Udonah's letter Iyayi, in his letter dated June 14, 1996 said: &quot;The cheques drawn in favour of Pinacle Commerical Bank were drawn with the hope that tranfers would have been made from my headquarters.&quot; Rationalising the issuing of the cheques Iyayi said further: &quot;When I started off this zonal office in Port Harcourt in July 1994, we rented Pinacle Commercial Bank properties for office and residential purposes. We decided to purchase these properties which were fully furnished and so after negotiations, we agreed on installmental payments.&quot; He concluded by saying that it was in expectation of the transfers to the account No. 485 that he issued those cheques.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theweek investigations, however, revealed that Iyayi was not saying the whole truth regarding PCB's property in Port Harcourt. Last September Aina had set up a two-man team, comprising A. Adegoroye, A FEPA director, and one Okoye, a principal internal auditor, which he sent to Port Harcourt to look into the fraud matter. The team reported: &quot;Meanwhile our two years tenancy for the FEPA office block owned by Pinacle Commercial Bank expired on August 31, 1996 and the bank has written to remind the agency to renew the tenancy being N1.4 million for the next two years as per the agreement.&quot; This contrasts sharply with Iyayi's claim that the agency has brought the rented PCB properties and that it was for the instalmental payment that the dud cheques were drawn in favour of PCB.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently foreseeing trouble, Chris Iyayi left Port Harcourt September 8, for Lagos with a promise to return to his base the following day. The next that was heard of Iyayi was a letter dated September 15, written from London, informing Aina that he had to make an urgent trip to attend to his &quot;very sick son who has been hospitalised since September 3 1996.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Chris may be out of reach at least for now, Macaulay of PCB has not been that lucky. He was nabbed by the security agents at the airport while trying to leave the country. He has since remained a guest of FIIB men at Alagbon helping them to crack the N1.115 billion mystery.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - An uninformed visitor to the ancestral home of Obed Azikiwe along Okosi Road in Ogbeabu village, Onitsha, November 2 would have mistakenly thought that Emeka Azikiwe, second son of the late Nnamdi Azikiwe, was there to inspect facilities for his father's burial ceremony slated for November 16.  But unknown to most people, Emeka has on that day accompanied Chuma, his elder brother, to the ancestral home where Onuorah Azikiwe, their uncle, and 18 other Ozo title holders from Ogbeabu village had gathered for a pre- initiation ceremony which would enable Chuma to take the prestigious Ozo title the next day, November 3. The initiation of Chuma into the Ozo title, according to sources, would give him an edge traditionally over other members of Zik's immediate household during and after the burial of the legend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere in Ogbeabu village in Inland Town, Onitsha, the Umuada Ogbeabu Ozomaocha (Zik's extended sisters) had risen from a meeting the previous week where they discussed the burial and resolved that Uche Azikiwe, wife of the late elder statesman, must not attend the burial ceremony of her late husband.  &quot;She should stay at Onuiyi Haven, Nsukka,&quot; the women said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uche incurred the wrath of the Umuada on October 20. On that day she had allegedly walked out on a meeting where the Umuada had asked her to apologise to Chuma, Ofala Okagbue, Obi of Onitsha, and one other highly placed Onitsha indigene over her &quot;abominable and libelous letter&quot; to Laz Unaogu, Minister for Special Duties and Chairman, National Planning Committee for the burial of Zik. In the letter, Uche had disclosed the remote and immediate cause of the squabbles between her and the first son of the Owelle. She insisted that the late elder statesman should be buried at Inosi Onira Retreat contrary to the earlier announcement by Chuma that Zik would be buried at Ogbeabu, their family home. The letter by Uche, according to the Umuada, tantamounts to washing Zik's dirty linen in public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Uche says that she was pushed to write the letter by &quot;Mr. (Chuma) Azikiwe's unrelented efforts to disgrace and disrespect and humiliate (her) late husband.&quot; In the letter, Uche said: &quot;My husband's wish was that he be buried in his 'Iba' (his personal homestead) at Inosi Onira Retreat, Onitsha.  That was in February 1996 at UNTH Enugu and immediately I contacted Abuja and Col. Mike Attah, the then military administrator of Anambra State, with regards to the reconstruction of Inosi Onira, Retreat which was gutted by fire in July 1994,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from the alleged insistence by the Owele that he should be buried in his own house, Uche contended that, based on Igbo tradition, which Onitsha is part of, other eminent indigenes of Onitsha such as Cecilia Arinze, Zik's sister; Akunwanne Sam Chudi, described as the alter ego to the late Owelle; Onuorah Ekpechi, private physician to Zik for over 30 years; Arthur Mbanefo and A.N.A Modebe, were of the opinion that a man is buried in his compound.  The only exception, Uche said, is if the person was a failure in life and had no house of his own, in which case he could be buried in his father's house.  Uche reasoned that to bury Zik at Ogbeabu is to liken him to such worthless persons in the society. According to her, the entire members of Azikiwe's household, excluding Chuma and his younger ones by his late mother, were unanimous that Zik should be buried at Inosi Onira Retreat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to convince the minister that Chuma is not a credible authority as far as the site and burial ceremony of the Owelle are concerned, Uche alleged that Zik parted ways with Chuma 13 years ago when Chuma &quot;intentionally&quot; excluded the name of Zik from the obituary programme and other activities for the burial of late Flora Azikiwe, Zik's late senior wife and Chuma's mother.  She stated further that during the quarrel between the Owelle and his son over the attitude of the latter to his father, Zik once drew the attention of Jonathan Onyemelukwe, Anglican bishop of the Niger, to the matter but nothing came out of the meeting held among the three. Uche claimed that when the mediatory efforts of the bishop failed, Chuma vowed in protest that Zik must be buried in the village at Ogbeabu whenever he died. She maintained that now that Zik is dead, to bury him the village, against his wish, would amount to according more recognition and respect to the wish of Chuma than that of Zik.  &quot;I will resist with the last drop of blood in my vein any move by Chuma or his cohorts to disrespect my late husband's wish to be buried in his personal 'Iba&quot; Inosi Onira Retreat,&quot; Uche said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To further justify her position, Uche pointed out that throughout the two months that Zik stayed in London clinic and the six months he stayed in the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital Enugu for treatment, Chuma neither visited nor wrote to inquire about the health of the man. &quot;On two occasions during the lifetime of the Owelle,&quot; Uche said, &quot;Zik in writing banned Chuma from stepping into any of his premises.&quot; She pointed out that the ban was yet to be lifted before the Owelle passed away last May 11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wife of the late sage argued further that the Obi of Onitsha, whom she accused of urging Chuma on, has no customary right to decide where the Owelle should be buried. The argument, according to her, is based on the fact that the Obi had no say and was not consulted to decide where other illustrious title holders from Onitsha who died before Zik were to be buried. Uche told Theweek at Nsukka that she does not speak with the press for now. However, one of her sons who spoke on her authority, mentioned Isaac Mbanefo, Odu of Onitsha, who died in 1994, and Philip Anatogu, Onowu of Onitsha who also died in 1994, as highly placed Onitsha indigenes who were buried in their personal homes without anyone asking the Obi to decide where they should be buried.  Uche, speaking through her son, maintained that the decision on where Zik should be buried is primarily that of his nuclear family and nobody else's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While accepting that Chuma, biologically is the first son of the Owelle, Uche's son argued that since he was not on speaking terms with their father for many years before he died, Chuma has no legal and customary right to decide what should be done to the remains of the elder statesman. &quot;Moreover,&quot; he continued, &quot;in a polygamous family (such as Zik's), decision as to where he should be buried should be that of the majority of the members of the family and not that of an individual.&quot; He said that Zik is survived by nine sons, all graduates, and that with the exception of the last two, the others are all independent. He discredited Chuma by saying that &quot;he is not married and has never been married, while most of his younger ones are married, thus making them more responsible men who should not be brushed aside in matters that affect their late father.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contrary to the argument by Chuma that his insistence that the Owelle should be buried in his ancestral home was informed by the culture and tradition of Onitsha people, Uche said through her son that &quot;the same culture and tradition that Chuma is purporting to uphold bars him from participating in the burial of the Owelle since they were not on speaking terms till death.&quot; She denied a newspaper publication that she recently visited Onitsha to plead with the Umuada over the matter. According to Uche, she has no quarrel with the women or any other person in Onitsha. To her, whatever quarrel that arises over her husband's burial &quot;is a family affair which should be handled internally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contradicting Uche, Maria Ikebuaku, secretary-general of Umuada Ozomaocha, told Theweek that their decision that Uche should not accompany Zik's corpse to Onitsha and should be excluded from participating in the funeral of Zik is irrevocable. Hear her: &quot;Uche has not done what we asked her to do for insulting our king and Chuma Azikiwe, so we have decided that she should stay put at Onuiyi haven, Nsukka.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Azuka Ndiwe, another leading member of Umuada, spoke in a similar vein. She told Theweek that nothing would make Zik to be buried at Inosi Onira. Said Ndiwe: &quot;The burial ceremony can be held at Inosi Onira but even if the government buries him there, we will exhume his body later and bury him at Ogbeabu.&quot; She argued that, were Zik a Muslim, he would have been buried long ago according to Muslim laws and custom &quot;but here we are telling them what the culture says and they are saying no.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither Chuma nor Emeka would like to join issue with their step mother.  Asked to comment on the preparations and burial arrangements for Zik, Chuma told Theweek at Ogbeabu that he was busy, adding though: &quot; I am the Owelle regent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chuma had wittingly or unwittingly marched on the stomach of his step mother during the official announcement of Zik's death. On that day, Chuma, after officially disclosing that Zik had joined his ancestors, added without recourse to other members of the family that would be buried at Ogbeabu, the family home. The rift deepened on May 28, when Chuma suspended all condolence visits to both Onitsha and Onuiyi Haven Nsukka. Few days later, Molokwu, Uche's eldest son, countered Chuma, saying: &quot;Chuma is not the spokesman of our family.&quot; From that moment, the squabbles among the Azikiwes became a national issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the controversy deepened last wee, some Onitsha indigenes who spoke with Theweek wondered why Zik should ask to be buried in Inosi Onira when he buried Flora, his eldest wife, at Ogbeabu. Whatever may be the case, Uche's wish seems to be the government's command. Lemmy Akakem construction Company, the firm handling Zik's Mausoleum, has gone far in the construction at Inosi Onira. The troubling question is, what happens--to Zik's family and his body-- after the burial?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - Tragedy befell the country last week as unconfirmed reports had it that 141 people, some of them prominent Nigerians may have died in a plane crash. The entire 132 passengers and nine crew member were feared dead in an air crash involving an ADC Airline Boeing 727 in which they were traveling from Port Harcourt to Lagos was reported missing few minutes to landing time.  Officials of the control tower at Murtala Mohammed Airport, Ikeja said they lost contact with the Flight ADC 086 airplane at exactly 5.05 p.m. last Thursday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately the plane was reported missing, several search and rescue operations involving the police, the air force, officials of the Federal Airports Authority for Nigeria and the fire service went in search of the missing plane. There were fears that the ill-fated plane had crashed into any of the swampy areas surrounding Lagos. By the early hours of last Friday, the rescue operations were combing such swampy areas around Ikorodu, Epe, Sagamu and Ijebu-Ode on the outskirts of Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by press time, there were no clues as to the whereabouts of the doomed plane. Unconfirmed reports had it that a pilot traveling on the same route as the affected plane said he sighted a ball of fire in the air around Ikorodu about the time the control tower said it lost contact with the plane. There were reports that the plane may have developed engine problem, caught fire and killed all the passengers on board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Opebi, Lagos head office of ADC Airlines, officials wee hard-put pacifying hundreds of anxious Nigerians and expatriates who besieged the office to get more information about the plane crash. Officials of the airline said they were still expecting the flight manifest of the plane from Port Harcout. Unconfirmed report had it that Claude Ake, a professor and national merit award winner was in the plane, as he was scheduled as a guest to Arne Ekseldt, the Swedish ambassador. Expatriates working for Schlumberger, an oil services company, and ED&amp;F Man LTD, a commodity trading firm, were also feared to be in the ill-fated plane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Augustine Okon, managing director of the airline was reported as saying that an official statement would not be ready until the situation was confirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - &quot;While women themselves lament and decry the continuation of the status quo, many continue to display a distinct hesitation and reluctance to take urgent decisive actions to rectify the situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such were the words of the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Ms. Elizabeth Dowdeswell as she officiated at the closing of a week-long biannual global meeting of the Women's World Banking (WWB) in Nairobi, Kenya, from November 4 to 8, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed if one judges by the official figures on the economic situation, very many ethnic groups in Africa would by now have starved to death because of the barren and unsustaining environment among other reasons - needless to mention persistent civil strife in some nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, women, men and children survive, thanks to women's astounding ability to get organised and adapt, although there are no statistics to reflect this state of affairs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One should not be quick to attribute this astounding ability to the waves of women emancipation. For long before the struggles for equality began, women were already culturally expected to keep the family going, depending of course on the natural resources available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) statistics indicate that the woman is the sole breadwinner in one out of three households throughout the world. Today, for every woman living in poverty, there are about four hungry children. Thus the size of a mother's income has a direct bearing on the nutritional health of her children. The higher her income, the less the likelihood that her children will suffer from hunger and malnutrition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women do not always receive remuneration for what they provide - food, water, fuel, care - but as these essential commodities grow increasingly scarce they more and more often must be paid for within the cash economy. The foregoing clearly explains why life or the quality of life depends upon purchasing power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such is the concern of the Women's World Banking (WWB), a non-profit making financial organization born in 1979 with the aim of building businesses and economies with a human face. The human face in this respect is creating innovative systems that help poor women entrepreneurs gain access to financial services, markets and information, enabling them to build their assets and economic roles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to WWB President Nancy Barry, the worldwide women's body with over 50 affiliates in more than 40 countries, is the only local global network opening access to finance, information and markets for women micro and small entrepreneurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To become an affiliate of WWB, the organization must be a micro- finance organization run exclusively by women and the women should hold no political responsibility whatsoever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nancy Barry explains this criteria with the belief that most governments and political ideologies do acknowledge that women are the cornerstones of human existence, yet they still fail to give due priority and resources to devise top quality policies on women's affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kenyan Women's Finance and Credit Trust (KWFCT) is leading in Africa with a clientele of 6,200 women. No wonder Kenya hosted the WWB global meeting which focused mainly on finding strategies of improving women's economic empowerment in Africa. The participants hoped to learn from the Kenyan experience of building financial services for her low-income women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other affiliates with small and growing micro-finance operations are finance trusts of the Gambia, Zambia, Rwanda and Uganda. According to the President of Duterimbere, the Rwanda Women's finance trust, Vinantie Rukarugonwa there are still constraints of institutional capacity to mobilize funds and also client connection and participation. She added that the loan tracking systems are still very poor. This, attributed to the recent genocide that left more than 70 per cent of the Rwandese women widows and orphans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea of giving loans to the low-income women is an excellent one but the lack of collateral often proves a major obstacle when one wishes to increase income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, what is happening is that African women are experimenting with peer pressure so that such groups can be the basis for further expansion. Some women use their monthly harvest as collateral to obtain credit fund loans. In this way, they also overcome the resistance of commercial banks to &quot; uneconomic&quot; small loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, the trend of feminism which is being followed may endanger the African family. The message ordinary women seem to be receiving is -- &quot;we are waging a war against men and the culture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems that most women's movements are advocating something similar to dividing roles equally. This attitude is causing problems for family life.  Men seem to be content with their traditional role while women are seen as revolutionary when they advance their notions. This brings tension which may have bad consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General violence against women is justified on cultural grounds. Culture itself cannot be changed overnight especially in Africa, where collective responsibility as a community is well expressed through the roles defined for men and women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waging war against men or against our culture is a non-starter. The militant approach will generally make men defensive and this will precipitate a break down in communication. Instead, men should be persuaded to respect women as mothers of the world and persons with talents and capabilities.  Women should also be encouraged to be proud of being who they are and advancing their cause as members with common objectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The development process has undeniably released many forces of change. It is crucial now to influence and intervene in the process to ensure that these forces create more opportunities than barriers for the poorest women to have more control over their lives and to have more choices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women's World Banking (WWB) is a worthwhile venture but it should begin dealing directly with the grassroots women for even better results.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Last September, the Kenyan government released its long-awaited findings on devil worship in the country, officially declaring that the practice was real and widespread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two-page government statement nevertheless drew curious reactions from a cross-section of Kenyans who publicly voiced their concern that the brief statement did not represent a full detailed report of the findings by the Presidential Commission of Enquiry on Devil Worship set up in 1994. The government statement, quoting self-confessed devil worshippers, revealed that the satanic cults practised rituals such as human sacrifice, the drinking of human blood, cannibalism and Black Mass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other rituals, according to the findings included incantations in intelligible languages, sexual abuse and rape, especially of children and minors, black magic, use of narcotic drugs and snakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the publication of this brief report prompted a group of Kenyan church leaders to hold prayers for the nation. Rev. Ibrahim Omondi, the coordinator of the prayers held at Nairobi's Uhuru (Freedom) Park on November 9, explained that the decision to conduct national prayers was also influenced by other factors which included a visit to a country suffering the wounds of civil strife, political and ethnic mistrust.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenyan church leaders drawn from various denominations had visited the Burundian capital, Bujumbura, in 1995, where they witnessed the extent to which civil war has affected the Central African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was after our visit to Burundi, where we prayed and praised God for His mercy on the Burundian community despite the troubled time of the nation, that we decided to form Kenya's Prophetic Destiny, an organization that would facilitate the hosting of national prayers,&quot; Rev. Omondi, who is also the founder of Kenya's Dove Christian Fellowship told APS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their visit, he said, led them to believe that Kenya was not immune to the kind of political set-ups and problems that have brought about fighting, killings and displacement of innocent human beings in Burundi, Rwanda and other African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Issues such as tribal and racial animosity that are at the core of killings between Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda and Burundi are already here with us. We also have corruption, mismanagement and other evil-related concerns that could easily lead our nation to what others already find themselves in,&quot; noted Rev. Omondi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is with such foresight that Kenyan church leaders, under the auspices of Kenya's Prophetic Destiny, a group of Christians called by God to see, hear, touch and feel the pain and anguish of the Kenyan nation, organised a day of prayers for the nation calling for repentance and reconciliation, under the theme Back to God, derived from the Book of Chronicles 7:13-14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his opening remarks during the prayers, Rev. Omondi noted that by coming together to pray for the nation &quot;God, will have mercy and bring hope and healing in our land, according to His promise in 2 Chronicles 7:14 that...'If my people, who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and will heal their land.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he officially opened the prayers, attended by nearly 3,000 worshippers drawn from various church backgrounds and beliefs, retired Anglican Archbishop Manasses Kuria, cautioned; &quot;We will not lend a hand to name calling, the pointing of fingers, nor will we apportion blame to any individual, group of people or organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We recognise that the sins of Kenyans are our sins. We will individually and collectively repent of these sins, turn from wickedness and seek reconciliations with other Kenyans and with God,&quot; he prayed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed out that Kenyans cannot honestly claim to have fared better than Burundians, for example, &quot;for we have shed blood among ourselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archbishop Kuria, who now runs a street children's home, the Jehovah Jire Children's home in Nairobi, was referring to what were believed to be politically motivated ethnic land clashes that rocked parts of Kenya in the 1991/93 period, resulting in loss of lives, displacement of thousands of people and loss and damage to properties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to be honest and pray for everything -- the victims of the land clashes, corruption within our institutions, mistrust, tribal and racial animosity among ourselves and lack of honesty within and among ourselves, which is all contrary to what God would want us to see, feel, touch and witness,&quot; he elaborated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisers had selected the prayers under three categories, namely prayers for reconciliation in the society, reconciliation with those in authority and reconciliation in the church. The prayers also took prophetic actions on concerns such as tribal, general and inter-racial tensions and the breakdown of marriages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading in the prayers for reconciliation in the church, Bishop William Tumsing of the Deliverance Church prayed that the missionary instituted churches on one side and the Pentecostal ones on the other would find solace and harmony to work together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We feel strongly that God should intervene and help us to overcome the sin of tension between the old and new churches. We know it exists, we know it is harmful. We know God will lead us into praying for repentance and reconciliation as one of the ways to battle it out,&quot; he prayed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Moderator of Kenya's Presbyterian Church of East Africa (PCEA) Dr.  George Wanjau, offering intercessory prayers asked that God would help Kenyans practice justice, humanity and honesty, and more so within the power corridors of the parliament, judiciary and the City Hall. He prayed for reconciliation with those in authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And dedicating prayers to reconciliation in the society, Retired Major John Seii, called for God's intervention &quot;so that seemingly conflicting&quot; ethnic groups can live in harmony as they did before the infamous land clashes, which gripped parts of Rift Valley and Western Provinces especially between 1991 and 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to call on God to come and live with us as part of our reconciliation and repentance. We need to say 'No' to tribal and racial animosity. We need to tell our leaders to stop to divide us on whichever lines,-- tribal, racial or colour,&quot; Seii prayed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other clergy, among them Daniel Seruwanga, Elizabeth Kamau, Wilson Mamboleo, Harry Das and Bishop James Ocholla, prayed for the end of &quot;racial animosity&quot; among the Kenyans of African origin, Asians and Whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to pray to God for the end of the racial animosity that exists among us, taking into account that although we are different in various human aspects, we are all the same in the eyes of God,&quot; they observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Ambrose Nyangao from the Baptist Church prayed that God would sustain Kenyan families and marriages. &quot;The fact that many families and marriages are satanically being put on trial, demands that we call God to come in and intervene for the present and future prosperity of the nation,&quot; he interceded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talking to APS, Rev. Omondi described the prayers as the beginning of a &quot; long journey.&quot; He said similar session would be conducted in other parts of the country, with the aim of bringing every Kenyan into the arena.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the most important factor of the exercise is to first believe in repentance and reconciliation, be ready to come to God and pray, with the aim to effect change in our day-to-day life,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - In both secular and religious circles, the choice of a key church leader is considered crucial to the process of general developments in most countries with a large Christian following. Kenya, with a national population of 26 million people, more than 60 per cent of whom claim to be Christians is no exception to such a norm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Church of the Province of Kenya (CPK), closely behind the Catholic Church in numerical strength, embraces members from different ethnic groups, all of whom have significantly contributed to the shaping of this East African nation which gained independence from Britain in 1963.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The search for the third archbishop of the Church of the Province of Kenya (CPK) which began in earnest two years ago when the long serving head of the church Archbishop Manasses Kuria retired, has taken interesting twists including amendments to the church's constitution so that the process could be hastened for the benefit of the faithful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the clock ticks closer to the November 20 election date, Anglicans and adherents of other Christian denominations are eager to know who will capture the church's top seat which is also being contested by the acting head of the CPK Bishop David Gitari (Kirinyaga Diocese).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from Gitari, there are four other bishops in the race. They include Bishop Benjamin Mwanzia Nzimbi of the Kitui Diocese (Eastern Province) Bishop Horace Etemesi of Butere Diocese, Bishop Stephen Kewasis of Eldoret Diocese and Bishop Joseph Wasonga of Maseno West.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts of church politics single out the ethnic factor as one of the most likely elements that will determine who will head the CPK into the 21st century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the 210-member electoral college of the church will not have it easy on November 20 as there are many other factors to consider in deciding who the spiritual head of Kenya's 3 million Anglicans will be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for ethnicity, the first archbishop of the CPK, Festo Olang came from the Luhya community while the second, Manasses Kuria belongs to the country's largest ethnic group, the Kikuyu. The Luhya, mainly inhabitants of Western Kenya are the third largest group after the Luo, neighbours in the west.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the exit of Archbishop Kuria in December 1994 upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 65 years, Gitari has been leading the CPK as both the archbishop and dean, steering the church through some of its stormiest periods, especially increased calls for more dioceses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most recent incidents in the CPK circles was the handling of the long-standing enthronement and consecration of the bishop elect of Kajiado diocese, Rev. Bernard Njoroge. The issue climaxed in a reported physical confrontation between the followers of the bishop -elect and those of Bishop Gitari, during which Rev. Njoroge was hurt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another was the case of the former bishop of Mount Kenya South Diocese, Bishop George Muiru Njuguna who was forced into early retirement in August 1995 following much publicised allegations of moral misconduct and misappropriation of church funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the candidates, 58-year-old Gitari is the senior most diocesan head in the church in terms of the number of years he has served as well as the position he currently occupies. He became bishop of Kirinyaga Diocese in Eastern Province in 1975.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Wasonga, represents a younger generation of CPK church leaders who are viewed as favourites among the youth members of the church. He comes from Nyanza Province in Western Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is also chairman of Kenya's largest grouping of Protestant churches under the 40-member umbrella of the National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) which includes the CPK itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Eldoret Diocese Bishop Kewasis from the Rift Valle Province, succeeded the late Bishop Alexander Kipsang Muge who died in a car crash in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Etemesi was elected the first bishop of the Butere Diocese in Western Province in 1993. With a background in communication, having been a past manager of Uzima Press, Etemesi also served as the Africa secretary of the London-based World Association for Christian Communication (WACC) prior to his appointment and subsequent consecration as bishop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The composition of the electoral college is aimed at making the election as fair and free as possible. It is made up of all the 22 diocesan bishops of the CPK, eight representatives from each of the dioceses, four being laity and four clergy except in the case of Nairobi diocese which is given four more electors in view of the fact that the archbishop automatically becomes the bishop of Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on the electoral process, retired Archbishop Kuria told this writer from his Buru Buru office of the Jehovah Jire Children's home, that he has no doubt the election will be free and fair. He compared the process to that of electing the head of the worldwide Roman Catholic Church. He at the same time appealed to Christians to pray hard so that God can show them who He has chosen to lead them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The elections come at a time when the CPK is at crossroads as it moves into the next millennium. First the church has found itself being increasingly challenged to tackle societal ills especially the question of poverty elimination, good governance, the housing crisis, problems of street children, urbanization, diminishing food security and the disabled among a host of other problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some observers say the CPK like other main line churches, has not seen rapid growth in terms of church membership. This slow progress CPK has been blamed on poor leadership and lack of spirituality in the teachings of the church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Infact, top leaders of the CPK, including retired Archbishop Kuria and Bishop Gitari have openly admitted that the church is facing a kind of moral and social crisis, citing actual incidents as obvious indications of this void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the political scene, the CPK has realised that it has to do more than in the past to pressurize the government to bring about the desired political and economic changes that Kenyans are advocating. The church's Justice and Peace programme has had to be strengthened and more funds channelled through the civic education programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This of course has not endeared the church to the establishment. The ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) party politicians have constantly accused the church of being the &quot;Church of the Politics of Kenya&quot;, wanting the clergy to confine themselves to the pulpit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the CPK has continued to stress its commitment to the salvation of man in totality -- economically, socially, spiritually and psychologically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics on the other hand have also voiced the need for the CPK to cleanse its house before pointing accusing fingers at others. They point out several instances where the church has not performed to the people's expectations.  The delayed enthronement and consecration of Rev.Njoroge of Kajiado diocese, the bishops' failure to speak with one voice on crucial matters such as tribal clashes and the life-styles of bishops themselves, are just a few of the weak areas these critics have focussed on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the electoral college meets, the members will have to search hard for the man who can give the CPK a new lease of life. The person to be elected will definitely have a heavy burden to carry in repairing the damage done to the image of the church, by giving it a new vision and mandate to serve Christians in totality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The huge challenges ahead of the CPK have in the recent past prompted several amendments to its constitution in order to bring it into the reality of today. The election of the third archbishop would not have been possible as the previous constitution had stipulated that all the seats must be filled before the election of the archbishop. Now the two dioceses without bishops can be represented by the vicar-general in the electoral college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on the election of the archbishop, the CPK Provincial Chancellor, lawyer Paul Kihara Kariuki, assured APS that all the necessary steps have been taken to ensure that the process is free and fair. He said that the whole exercise is being handled with all the confidentiality possible and that the question of rigging should be totally ruled out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He at the same dispelled fears of political interference which many Christians to whom this reporter talked to could not rule out. Since the CPK is the largest Protestant Church with a sizeable following, it is viewed as a force to reckon with by politicians and government because of the influence it can have on the faithful. There is no secret that politicians have sought the support and even blessings of the CPK bishops in those areas where the church is strong before venturing into politics. During past elections of the archbishop, some bishops have levelled accusation of political interference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first elections of the church after independence in 1963, Festo Olang beat Obadiah Kariuki.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the second elections held in November 1979, Manasses Kuria turned tables on a favourite candidate Henry Okullu, taking control of the CPK for the next 15 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The November 20 elections will be held at the All Saints Cathedral, Nairobi.  The results will be expected to be announced immediately unless unexpected complications arise. The winner will also occupy the grand Anglican Archbishop's residence next to State House, Nairobi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - The All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) secretariat has launched preparatory activities for the organisation's 7th Assembly to be held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from October 5 to 13, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the AACC has written to all its member churches all over Africa, asking them to launch preparations for the forthcoming Assembly.  Speaking to APS, the Assembly co-ordinator Rev. Setri Nyomi disclosed that each member church will have to plan when the launching should take place, &quot; but of course taking into consideration the time left, between now and October next year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Setri, who is also the executive secretary for Christian and Family Life Education Programme, together with the AACC general secretary, Rev. Jose Chipenda and his deputy Rev. Phylis Byrd, joined other members of staff in a ceremony to launch activities leading to the 7th Assembly which will meet under the theme, Troubled But not Destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The events during the launching of the forthcoming Assembly included a moving sermon by Rev. Chipenda, historical facts about the organisation's past assemblies and the symbolic watering of a palm tree, as a sign of &quot; growth and hope&quot; for this pan-African organisation of 142 member churches and affiliated national Christian councils in 39 African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first AACC Assembly was held in the Ugandan capital, Kampala in 1963 under the theme Freedom and Unity, one month after the Organization of African Unity (OAU) was established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second one was held in Abidjan, Ivory Coast (1969) under the theme Working with Christ in Africa Today, Lusaka, Zambia (1974) under the subject Living no Longer for Ourselves... But for Christ, Nairobi, Kenya, (1981) under the theme To Follow the Light of Christ; Lome, Togo (1987) under the theme You Shall Be my Witnesses, while Harare, Zimbabwe, hosted the last assembly in 1992, which discussed the subject, Abundant Life in Jesus Christ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Dr. Setri, the AACC committee, charged with the responsibilities of the preparation and the holding of the organization's next Assembly, has drawn up a budget of US$1.59 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Out of this amount, the member churches of the AACC are expected to raise some US$500,000 while the remaining amount will come from ecumenical partners.  He also announced during the launching here that the AACC staff members have already raised US$10,000 towards the Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the same gathering, which was also attended by Mr. Melaku Kifle, the Coordinator for Refugee and Migration Services at the World Council of Churches (WCC), Geneva and Mr. Lee Holland, the Africa Secretary for United Church of Canada, Rev. Chipenda reminded staff that Africa is &quot;really troubled but fortunately not totally destroyed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Phylis Byrd told the congregation that &quot;even in deep troubles, God has always guided His people and therefore the African continent and its people, should continue to embrace God, even when troubles become unbearable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The climax of the ceremony was the symbolic watering of the palm tree, placed at the AACC chapel, where the ceremony took place. Mr. Elias Nkanata, the longest-serving member of staff at the AACC, Mr. Lee Holland and Ms.  Angelique Bell watered the tree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr. Nkanata represents the history of the organization (he has served AACC for the last 31 years), Mr. Holland, the ecumenical partnership and Angelique Bell, represents the 'new blood' at the AACC, having joined the organization two months ago&quot;, explained Rev. Byrd.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The stage is set for a face to face meeting in the coming week between former South African president Pieter Botha and the chairman of the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Archbishop Desmond Tutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 30, an apartheid-era security policeman said Brigadier Jack Cronje claimed that Botha was fully aware of police death squads which targeted anti-apartheid activists in the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cronje told the commission that Botha, as chairman of the now- defunct State Security Council, would have been kept fully informed of the activities of the death squads.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cronje, a former member of a police death squad based on Vlakplaas farm outside Pretoria, is one of five ex-policemen to confess involvement in 40 murders in testimony to a Johannesburg hearing of the truth commission, which is probing political crimes during the apartheid era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The previous week, former police commissioner General Johan van der Merwe told the hearing that Botha ordered the 1988 bombing of a Johannesburg religious office in which 23 people were injured and that Botha was behind apartheid-era abuses. Botha has not yet commented on the claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cronje said on November 13 that police hit squads were established to keep in power the National Party (NP), which ruled South Africa under the apartheid system from 1948 until historic all-race elections in 1994, and to combat communism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Without the security police, the National Party would not have stayed in government one week,&quot; Cronje said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether security police hit squads could be considered the &quot;iron fist&quot; of the NP, he replied: &quot;Yes, it could be understood in that way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The security police were primarily there for political purposes, and the political purpose of the National Party government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cronje earlier told the commission that a crack army unit planned and carried out the 1986 murders of anti-apartheid activist Dr. Fabian Ribeiro and his wife Florence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cronje, according to the domestic news agency SAPA, told the hearing that the assassins were two Angolans who were flown to South Africa by the special forces, an anti-guerrilla military unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he believed Ribeiro had been murdered because of his involvement in recruiting members of the then-outlawed African National Congress (ANC) for training abroad and providing medical assistance to activists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ribeiro and his wife were gunned down in their home in Mamelodi black township, near Pretoria, on December 1, 1986.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on November 13, Archbishop Tutu, visiting the United States, said in Chicago that he hoped to arrange a meeting next week with former South African president Pieter Botha to discuss allegations that he had ordered apartheid-era atrocities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botha, now an octogenarian in poor health, was recently approached by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission which Tutu heads to privately provide answers about apartheid-era abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tutu, who is in the US to attending a general assembly of the National Council of Churches, said he had suggested that the meeting be held last week but said Botha felt this was too soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He (Botha) suggested this coming Friday (November 15). Unfortunately I'm in America,&quot; Tutu said. &quot;We are looking for (a meeting) some time...when I get back next week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September, convicted police killer, Colonel Eugene de Kock, who has been sentenced to more than 200 years in prison on 89 charges, including six murders, named Botha as having also ordered the bombing of a Johannesburg labour union office in the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botha and his successor to the presidency, Frederik de Klerk were both aware of numerous apartheid abuses, de Kock further claimed but the two ex- presidents have denied knowledge of any apartheid- sponsored abuses.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bensalah, Algeria - Some 12 people, including four women and three children, were slaughtered early on November 13 in this village in northern Algeria, in an apparent reprisal for opposition to Muslim extremists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to eyewitnesses, some 15 members of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) stole into Bensalah, a small village near the town of Blida, and slit the throats of the 12 civilians, 10 of whom belonged to the same family, witnesses said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the members of the family was a &quot;patriot&quot; of the self-defence group which protects the village from terror attacks, a group whose members the extremist Islamic groups, who have battled the government in Algiers for almost five years, have vowed to kill to avenge resistance to their uprising.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They also set fire to a van which alerted the other villagers, who saw the flames,&quot; one villager said, adding: &quot;The patriots came out into the night and fired shots into the air. The terrorists fled. We thought they would have then attacked a second family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A small group from the self-defence unit were guarding the village at the time of the attack, but they said their cover was trenched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killings brought to 76 the number of people killed this month. Attacks by Islamic militants have increased in recent weeks as a constitutional referendum called by President Liamine Zeroual looms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fundamentalists are opposed to the referendum, which is due to be held on November 28, and which if passed will strengthen presidential powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Blida region south of Algiers was the scene on November 5 of one of the bloodiest attacks of Algeria's war between the army and fundamentalist militants, during which 32 people were slaughtered by Muslim extremists in the mountain hamlet of Sidi El Kabir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same day, suspected Islamic extremists slaughtered a family of four, including a pregnant woman in a village near the hamlet, some 50 kilometres south of the Algerian capital, Algiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On November 11, a car bomb blast killed 10 people and wounded more than 20 in an Algiers suburb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The precise motives for the attacks remain unclear, but many fall into the category of revenge operations against the civilian population and against self-defence groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several thousand such groups have been set up, with the encouragement of the Algerian authorities, to ward off attacks by extremists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fundamentalists rose up in January 1992 after the army intervened to cancel elections that the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win. The ensuing violence has left tens of thousands of people dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities have been insisting for a year that they are now facing only &quot; residual terrorism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But part of the opposition disputes the claim, saying that in fact the security situation is worsening and will deteriorate further with the holding of the referendum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the legal opposition has just launched an &quot;appeal for peace,&quot; which has been supported by the FIS, now in exile abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FIS has also condemned attacks on civilians, but its armed wing, the Islamic Salvation Army, often claims responsibility for attacks on self- defence groups.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - Intense backroom lobbying is going on at the United Nations in New York in search of a successor to the current United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros Ghali, 73, of Egypt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boutros Boutros Ghali is not ready to retire, but the government of the United States of America has made it clear it will veto any attempt to re- elect the Egyptian for a second term on November 18 (today).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, because all his predecessors since 1945 when the United Nations was founded - Tygve Lie of Norway, Dag Hammarskjold of Sweden until he died in a plane accident in Congo in 1961, U Thant of Burma, Kurt Waldeheim of Austria and Javier Perez De Cuellar of Peru - all had second terms, African nations have been assured the continent retains its chance to the post for the next five years since the United States has threatened to boot Boutros Ghali through their veto in the security council.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year in Yaounde, Cameroon, African nations underscored their support for the embattled Ghali in the &quot;Yaounde Declaration,&quot; wherein they promised to stand by the incumbent despite the threatened veto by the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, African nations are also aware that if a stalemate results, they may lose their chance to other strong candidates from other continents such as former Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Bruntland, Mary Robinson, the 52 year-old President of Ireland or Japanese Sadako Ogata, the high profile United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the UN Security Council has made it clear that ideally an African should succeed Boutros Ghali, it only makes sense for Africa to back other candidates from the continent in order to forestall any victory by non- Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately, there are three potential successors to Ghali from Africa. The front runner remains Kofi Annan of Ghana, the UN Under Secretary General for peacekeeping who has strong support from the Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second candidate is Hamid Ayabir of Niger, currently Secretary General of the World Islamic Conference. But given fears of resurgent Islam, America may shy away from this candidate from Niger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third candidate from Africa with a reasonable chance of capturing the seat is Salim Ahmed Salim of Tanzania, the current Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Much as some (Western) media reports have predicted that Kofi Annan of Ghana will take the post if the United States is adamant about showing Ghali the door, a number of surprise candidates may spring up at the last moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With gender issues quite strong at the moment, Graca Machel, the widow of former Mozambican President Samora Machel may be floated as successor to Ghali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olara Otunnu, Uganda's former Foreign Minister and current head of the International Peace Institute in New York is also said to be interested.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The children were rescued from Sudan earlier this year by Bishop Paride Taban of Torit Catholic Diocese as they fled from Sudanese Antonov bombers which sporadically drop bombs in African villages in the Nuba Mountains under the control of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bishop told journalists earlier this month that the 47 Sudanese were &quot; desperate children without parents to look after them, but in need of education. We want to help them grow up into useful citizens.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been increasing incidents of rebels fighting the government of President Yoweri Museveni in Uganda, targeting Sudanese refugees in settlements near the Sudan/Uganda/Zaire border. The translocation of the destitute children from the border area by Bishop Taban is seen as a precautionary measure for their safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebels of the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF) led by Colonel Juma Oris renewed their threats to Sudanese refugees in late October/November saying that refugee camps run by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other international relief agencies should be vacated or face violence.  The threats have been confirmed by the UNHCR Public Affairs Officer, Wendy Rappeport. &quot;The operations have not been affected but there is some scare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 18, rebels attacked Palorinya refugee camp and killed 16 refugees. There have been a number of attacks on other refugee camps in the north-west and northern Uganda in subsequent weeks that resulted in extensive vandalisation of relief vehicles and equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is believed that rebels are acting according to Sudan government agenda which is to hit refugees by proxy (i.e. Ugandan rebels) and destroy any potential of the camps serving as supply or resting bases for SPLA fighters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of a peace that Sudan is likely to sign with Uganda in the coming weeks, Sudan is demanding that the more than 150,000 Sudanese refugees in northern Uganda be removed into locations at least 100 kilometres inside Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negotiations which could lead to a peace pact between Uganda and Sudan are at an advanced stage, according to Iranian sources. The Iranian President Ali Akber Rafsanjani initiated the talks between Uganda and Sudan after his visit to Africa last September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Ugandan officials late October in Tehran, declined to sign an agreement to end hostilities pending &quot;clarification&quot; from Khartoum regarding border incursions by Ugandan rebels alleged to be operating from inside Sudanese territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other reports in Khartoum, have suggested that Sudanese leader Omar el Bashir may visit Kampala soon to sustain the peace initiative in the region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - The All Africa Conference of Churches, (AACC) concerned about the plight of hundreds of thousands of refugees from Burundi and Rwanda who are in Zaire and Tanzania, is appealing for a peaceful end to the current crisis in Eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement here on November 14, the continental church body expressed concern that an &quot;explosive situation exists in the Great Lakes region involving citizens of Rwanda, Burundi and Zaire. Today, we are witnessing the possibility of an open inter-state war that can be avoided.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement, signed by the organization's General Secretary Rev. Jose B.  Chipenda said the AACC is pleased to see the Heads of State in the Great Lakes region meeting several times to find solutions to the situation which has developed after the death of President Melchior Ndadaye of Burundi in 1993 and Juvenal Habyarimana of Rwanda in 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But AACC lamented that the main issues relating to the crisis in the Great Lakes region have not been attended to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These include the return of refugees, land shortage, citizenship and integrity of national borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the return of refugees, the church organization noted that although the movement of people in Rwanda and Burundi traces back to the late 1950s continuing through the 60s and 70s, it has become more or less a way of life for the people in these two countries to flee home any time civil strife erupts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AACC, therefore, requested Heads of State in the region to work closely with the countries concerned to create conducive conditions and welcome back bona fide refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turning to land shortage, the AACC General Secretary observed that in situations where demographic explosions occur, there is always the need to develop a policy of good neighbourliness in order to encourage and enable citizens find jobs in neighbouring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AACC therefore, called for the issuing of international travel documents to the people so that they can place their skills in neighbouring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting that almost every group in Africa at one time or other came from somewhere, the AACC wondered how many years one should live in a host country before one is entitled to citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation of the Banyamulenge should be looked into if in reality they have lived in Eastern Zaire for nearly 200 years,&quot; the statement added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The continental church body also acknowledged the wisdom of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in declaring the inviolability of national boundaries inherited at independence, as stated in the OAU Charter and especially the Cairo Declaration of 1964.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AACC thus called on countries in the region to honour the inviolability of national borders and appealed for the ceasing of all cross-border incursions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement also highlighted AACC's stand that &quot;the intervention of forces should not be considered as a measure to solve the problems in the Central African region.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Christian communicators from Lutheran Churches in Africa have called for effective networking in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group of 21 editors of Lutheran church newsletters attending a seminar on church newsletters here from November 7 to 11, also challenged the churches in the region to facilitate this kind of collaboration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike in the past, where communicators would work comfortably in &quot; isolation&quot;, the situation today has changed, the seminar participants, drawn from 22 out of the 25 Lutheran churches in Africa observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the seminar, participants analysed news contents, lay-out, distribution of their newsletters/magazines and the general working conditions in their respective stations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzanian Seth Kitange, who was a resource person during the seminar, noted that although there has been a substantial increase in the number of church newsletters within the Lutheran churches in Africa in the past, &quot;their quality left a lot to be desired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While we must commend ourselves for the positive steps we have taken towards the institution of newsletters in our churches, we must also feel challenged to improve on them in the areas of news gathering, lay-out and distribution,&quot; advised Kitange who is also the General Secretary for the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania (ELCT) Northern Diocese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He singled out readiness to share experiences and ideas and exchange of publications as effective ways of improving the quality of the publications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seminar, which preceded a five-day conference of the LWF related Regional Communication Organizations (November 11 to 15), was jointly organised by the recently opened LWF Africa regional office in Nairobi and the department of communication in the LWF-Geneva office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing participants, Ms. Anneli Janhonen, Director and Editor- in-Chief, LWF Office for Communication Services, Geneva, introduced the forthcoming Ninth Assembly of the LWF, to be held from July 8 to 16, 1997 in Hong Kong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Like in the past, the media will be expected to play a vital role in the assembly. You are part of the media fraternity and therefore the world will expect you to play your part effectively. You may not be in Hong Kong, directly, but you will definitely be involved in one way or other,&quot; she told the Lutheran church communicators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LWF assembly will be hosted by the Hon Kong Lutheran Federation (HKLF), previously called the Chinese Lutheran Churches Hong Kong Association. Some 400 delegates from LWF member churches and a further 1,000 participants representing observers, advisers, ecumenical guests and the press will attend the assembly which also marks the 50th anniversary of the LWF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Bernhardur Gudmundsson, the Secretary for Communication Consultancy in the LWF Department for Mission and Development, challenged the Christian communicators to take their &quot;assignments&quot; seriously, as one way to &quot;entice&quot; churches to give more financial and moral support to the communication work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Collete Bouka-Coula, the head of the recently instituted LWF regional Office in Africa, addressed the issue of the All-Africa Lutheran Churches Information and Coordination Centre (ALICE), which was created by Lutheran churches in Africa in 1978.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the body was created with a good purpose, it faced many problems and at one time had to come to a halt, she told the seminar delegates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALICE was initially based in Arusha, Tanzania, under the auspices of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania (ELCT).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Bouka-Coula further told the seminar participants that the organization has had its own defects due to lack of flow of information. There has been discontinuity in the secretariat, she added, pointing out that at the same time, some members have not been giving their yearly contributions regularly while others have cut down their commitment altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on a positive note, Dr. Bouka-Coula said ALICE will be revived and its headquarters moved from Tanzania to Nairobi, Kenya, following recommendations made at a church leaders' meeting held at Limuru, Kenya in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The church leaders in Africa decided during their meeting in Limuru, Kenya, in 1992 to evaluate ALICE, and the committee of five made a recommendation to transfer the centre to Nairobi in conjunction with the All Lutheran Coordination Office (today, the Regional Office in Africa),&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also explained that &quot;the existence of ALICE has never been questioned either by member churches or the LWF secretariat in Geneva. The issue has been how to render ALICE more efficient in serving the churches.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Bouka-Coula in her presentation cited the high arrears of churches' membership fees, the lack of regular meetings of ALICE Board, the relocation of ALICE headquarters, the appointment of the new Board and the irregularity in sending articles to publish as some of the problems that bogged down this regional communication network for the Lutheran churches in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Up to 1993, the only assignment the Executive Secretary had consisted in publishing the Africa Theological journal,&quot; she noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LWF Regional Office for Africa became operational in July 1, 1996. Its objectives include the coordination of regional and sub- regional activities of the LWF's Department for Mission and Development (DMD) in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Bouka-Coula said the office for Africa, is also charged with responsibilities of projects' write-up and the coordination and consultation on various programmes related to Mission and Cities and Industrial Areas in Africa (MICIAA), leadership training and rural development consultative services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Bouka-Coula, a Cameroonian, who formerly worked in the LWF Geneva Office as Assistant Secretary for Africa Region, is designated as the Field Officer, for the new office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are an estimated 7.8 million Lutherans in Africa spread out in 17 countries representing 25-member churches of the LWF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Founded in 1947, in Lund, Sweden, the LWF is a confessional body bringing together 56 million Lutheran in 122 member-churches in 68 countries the world over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LWF's highest decision making body is its Assembly which normally meets every six years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previous assemblies have met as follows; Lund, Sweden (1947), Hannover, Germany (1952), Minneapolis, USA (1957), Helsinki, Finland (1963), Evian, France (1970), Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (1977), Budapest, Hungary (1984) and Curitiba, Brazil in 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between Assemblies, the LWF is governed by a 49-member Council which meets annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The staff of the LWF is headed by a general secretary, currently Dr.  Ishmael Noko from Zimbabwe. Its Executive Committee is headed by a president, presently Rev. Dr. Gottfried Brakemeier from Brazil.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The African elephant, which has been hunted for a long time for its tusks and meat, or for the damage it causes to crops, now lives in a limited space, following endless encroachment on its habitat by man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specialists blame the loss of natural habitat on several human activities such as deforestation, the building of barriers to block the elephants access to water and food, and the fragmentation of their environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In East Africa for instance, the territory occupied by elephants has been reduced from 87 to 27 percent between 1925 and 1975, while human population increased at a yearly rate of 2.9 percent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protection of elephants and land disputes between humans were the focus of discussions between African, European and American specialists last week in Dakar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wide-scale destruction caused by elephants have led, in a country like Kenya, to the creation of the Kenya Wildlife Service, which is waging a war against poachers and ivory traffickers to protect the endangered species.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Congo, about 15 scientists, academics and journalists set up in August in Brazzaville a non-governmental organization -- 'Elephant And Hippopotamus International' -- to fight against poaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initiative follows the massacre of over 200 elephants in the northern Congolese region of Sangha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Led by Antoine Mapangui, a specialist in environmental protection, the Congolese NGO is planning to set up a network for surveillance and warning to international opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NGO's policy is in line with the preservation measures taken by several Central African countries to protect endangered wildlife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The elephants' territory has also shrunk in West Africa. Populations are destroying the forest in search of firewood. Animals are now only found in protected areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In general, populations have difficulty accepting that wildlife be better protected than humans. In 1992 in Kenya, 48 elephants were culled after they killed 40 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, elephants play an important role in the conservation of biodiversity. They contribute to the regeneration of habitats through the dissemination and germination of seeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some specialists think that the impact of their growing density is rather negative. When their density is high, they have, for instance, managed to eat up the whole foliage in certain areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, scientists do not agree on the course of action to be adopted to check the impact of elephant activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advocates of control on elephants have opted for culling as a away reducing their nuisance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But those who favor protection play down the threat on biodiversity and adopt a rather cautious attitude.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are busy with the matter,&quot; he said, &quot;but a great of negotiations are required before we can make any deployment of our troops in that area.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - The dreaded and deadly Ebola virus has struck in South Africa for the first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Director of Communicable Diseases at the National Department of Health, Dr. Neil Cameron, confirmed Sunday night that a 46-year-old nursing sister at a Johannesburg clinic, Marilyn Lehana, had apparently contracted the disease from a Gabonese doctor.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the first known case of the disease being contracted in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lehana apparently contracted a strain known as Ebola Gabon while performing a procedure on a Gabonese doctor with multi-organ disfunction. The doctor arrived in South Africa late October from Gabon, where an outbreak had just claimed 17 lives. He has since recovered fully and was discharged a week ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although diagnosis of the fever has given cause of concern, experts do not foresee an uncontrollable outbreak of the disease in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 200 people, who have been in contact with Lehana and the Gabonese doctor, are being monitored for symptoms of the Ebola virus. The authorities say monitoring will continue for the next 21 days until the period of possible infection is over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International disease expert Dr. Bob Swanepoel said &quot;the world and South Africa has been given a wake-up call,&quot; pointing out that the ease of movement across the globe meant that an outbreak of Ebola fever could occur anywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola fever was first identified about 20 years ago. There have been about 1,000 victims to date, and death has occurred in 80 to 90 percent of the cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a hemorrhagic fever spread through close contact with bodily fluids.  Early symptoms are headaches and fever and, as the virus advances, uncontrollable bleeding and multiple organ disfunction occurs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident resulted from a meeting between the two leaders in Pretoria last week, after which Mandela suggested that Chiluba delay Monday's general elections in order to sort out the question of participation by former President Kenneth Kaunda.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reports say former Zambian Foreign Minister Vernon Mwaanga responded by attacking Mandela for interfering in the country's constitutional affairs, saying Zambia was mature enough to handle its own problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Zambia could not start receiving instructions from Mandela like school children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, Chiluba has banned senior party and cabinet members from commenting on the issue. &quot;No-one at the national executive committee of the ruling party, or indeed the cabinet, will be allowed to respond to any statements by any head of state...it will only be commented by me,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba added that Mandela had always sought peace in Zambia, South Africa and Southern Africa as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He has been instrumental in trying to bring dialogue between me and Dr.  Kenneth Kaunda to ensure that there is peace in the country,&quot; he said, &quot;and that's no interference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Mandela has never at any time sought to interfere in our internal affairs,&quot; said the Zambian leader, &quot;and if anything he has tremendous attachment to Zambia.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figures made available by oil experts at the 14th annual international conference of the Nigerian Association of Petroleum Explorationists, showed that the country currently has a reserve of 110 trillion cubic feet of gas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This translates to 20 times of the nation's crude oil reserves with 70 percent of the gas being flared at present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gas flaring is expected to end with the take-off of a gigantic liquefied natural gas project for the export of the commodity from 1999 to European markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statistics also put Nigeria's crude oil reserve at 20.8 billion barrels, after Libya in Africa with a reserve of 29.5 billion barrels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oil accounts for more than 80 percent of Nigeria's total foreign exchange earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With an average production of 1.87 million barrels of oil daily, the experts estimate that Nigeria's oil reserves can last over 30 years without exploring new ones.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fossils and stone tools were unearthed near the surface of a barren hill close to a dry river-bed at the Hadar site in the Afar highlands close to where &quot;Lucy&quot; was found in 1974.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An announcement by the team working under the auspices of the the Institute of Human Origins (IHO) of the University of California at Berkeley, published Tuesday in newspapers in Addis Ababa, said that an upper jaw of early Homo, the genus to which modern human belong, was recovered with primitive tools.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These remains may hold clues to the ancestry of living humans, for they represent &quot;the oldest family dated association of stone tools with a fossil of human ancestors,&quot; the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The short, flat snout and broad parabolic dental arch that was discovered link the fossil to geologically younger ancestors of Homo sapiens, the IHO statement said. However, it noted that the fossil lacks the long, narrow palate and projecting face that gives the skull of &quot;Lucy&quot; the ape-like visage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The main importance of the latest discovery is that it helps plug a gap in the evidence for the early evolution of human lineage and perhaps will help begin to forge links in time to Afarensis,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is in reference to &quot;Lucy,&quot; the most complete example of the small brained, big jawed, upright walking Australopithecus Afarensis (after the Afar tribe inhabiting Hadar) which, the IHO statement noted, is not known as yet to have made stone tools. The scientific team co-led by IHO's William H.  Kimbel, Robert C. Walter and Donald C. Johanson, had been conducting filed work at Hadar since 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team will continue to focus its field activities on filling important gaps in the fossil record. &quot;We're virtually starting from scratch in discovering the earliest evolution of our own lineage,&quot; Kimbel was quoted as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As in the past, Ethiopia will play a major role in providing the needed evidence,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria and the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group began talks in Abuja Tuesday, amid controversy over the absence of Canadian members of the delegation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian foreign ministry said in a statement two Canadian security men, who were to accompany their country's secretary of state to the meeting were denied visas because of their insistence to bear arms in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministry said the visa application for the two officers in question, whose names were not on the original list submitted by Canada, had erroneously created the impression that they were diplomats.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the identity of the security personnel was only established following further enquiries by Nigeria, the statement added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canada is a member of the eight-nation action group set up last November after Nigeria was suspended from the organization in the aftermath of the execution for murder of nine minority rights leaders, including the author Ken Saro-Wiwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commonwealth had in a statement ahead of Tuesday's meeting in Abuja, said Canada would not participate because of Nigeria's refusal to grant visas to the two security personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Nigerian foreign ministry described the allegation as not only &quot; false,&quot; but a misrepresentation of the facts of the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said the officials had insisted on carrying arms despite efforts to persuade the Canadian authorities that this contradicted the practice in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the light of the foregoing, any attempt to suggest other reasons for the non-issuance of the visas to the Canadian security personnel is misleading and mischievous,&quot; the statement added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria recently closed its diplomatic mission in Canada for economic reasons, although diplomatic sources blamed the action on Canada's tough action against Abuja.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Breaking ranks with the other Commonwealth members, Canada has been pushing ahead with unilateral sanctions against Nigeria, amid press reports that the country was also supporting Nigerian opposition groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the meeting between Nigeria and the Commonwealth delegation led by its chairman, Stan Mudenge of Zimbabwe, was being conducted without opening press statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian delegation is led by foreign minister, Tom Ikimi, while representatives of Nigeria's five newly-established political parties and officials of the transition agencies are also participating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commonwealth said in its statement that the status of Nigeria's transition programme was on the agenda of the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting is a follow-up to the one in London in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria had earlier rejected a fact-finding mission by the Commonwealth team, insisting that its suspension from the organization was unfair.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two officials from the American company were received on Tuesday by Congolese president Pascal Lissouba who asked them to submit to his government a feasibility study within 60 days, the sources said without giving details.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new airport, whose cost and source of funding have not been disclosed, will be built over three years at Mont-Barnier, 23 km (14.4 miles) south of Brazzaville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will have the capacity to handle one million passengers a year, which is double the current capacity of Maya-Maya international airport in the Congolese capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due the extension of the town, Maya-Maya airport is now in the middle of neighborhood areas, where people are scared by by the noise of low-flying aircraft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the sources, the two officials from the U.S. company will visit the international airport in Congo's second largest city, Pointe-Noire, on Thursday, to study the possibility of also building a new international airport in the town.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - A miniature oil extracting machine introduced by Africare to press edible oil from sunflower and other seed has proved popular among Zambian peasant farmers and individual households.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The machine, weighing only 50 kilograms, is known as the &quot;Ram Press&quot; and is manually operated. It was initially designed and developed by an American engineer for an oil processing project in Arusha, Tanzania.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ram Press was first introduced to Zambia some four years ago and is currently being manufactured and distributed by several Zambian companies, according to Africare officials who are the main makers and marketing agents of the machine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africare is an American private non-governmental organization engaged in a variety of projects to improve the quality of life in rural Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africare officials told PANA Wednesday that almost 2,000 of the machines have been acquired so far by peasant farmers in various parts of the country for cooking oil production for both domestic consumption and sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The machine has become so popular that we are not able to keep up with current demand,&quot; said an official who works in the marketing department at the Africare Lusaka office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ram Press is designed so that it could be easily moved and operated either outside or indoors. It is operated by raising and pulling down a long handle which drives a steel ram into the slotted cage. This compresses the seed and squeezes oil through openings in the cage. It is capable of producing between 10 and 12 liters (2.6 gallons) of cooking oil from a 50- kilogram (110 pounds) of sunflower seed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africare has ensured that all local manufacturers of the ram press also stock adequate spare parts to service the growing clientele. It has in addition trained a cadre of technical staff in various parts of the country to repair and make spare parts for the machine in local workshops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization has recommended a specific variety of sunflower seed called &quot;record&quot; for oil production because of its high oil content of between 28 and 45 percent. The ram press is able to extract up to 75 percent of the oil.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) - Rebels in southern Sudan have agreed to the unconditional release Friday of three officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross, according to a joint statement Wednesday by the Red Cross and the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) Bahr Gazal splinter group, controlled by Kerubino Kwanyin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Commander Kerubino agreed to release them,&quot; it said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deputy director for operations of the Red Cross, Paul Grossrieder, flew to Sudan and met with Kerubino for two days discussing the release of the officials held in Wunrok, near Gogrial, in southern Sudan, the statement added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Commander Kerubino agreed to have them transferred to Gogrial where their personal safety could be guaranteed. He also let an ICRC delegate meet with the five SPLA personnel arrested with the ICRC staff,&quot; when the plane mistakenly landed in an area controlled by Kerubino's group, thinking it was still held by the mainstream SPLA faction led by John Garang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A senior official from the government of Sudan took part in the discussions between Mr Grossrieder and Commander Kerubino and played an active mediating role,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plane carrying the three Red Cross officials was detained Nov. 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In April, Kerubino signed a peace pact with the government in Khartoum ending hostilities between them in southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he seized the plane, Kerubino said he had done so because it was carrying five armed soldiers of Garang's faction and 13 boxes of ammunition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the release deal, he has maintained that the Red Cross had deviated from its humanitarian mission by transporting weapons and ammunition to the Garang group. The Red Cross has agreed to an investigation to be conducted by independent personalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The joint statement said that the parties &quot;will take the necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such events.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Ninety-nine percent of Zimbabwean married women and 100 percent of its married men know at least one modern method of family planning, the United States-based Population Reference Bureau says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its report on an International Demographic Health Survey entitled &quot;Men and Family Planning in Africa,&quot; the bureau says more than 80 percent of the men know about withdrawal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over 60 percent of them, it says, are aware of abstinence and over 40 percent know about vasectomy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It says that 94 percent of married Zimbabwean women approve of family planning compared to 82 percent of the married men. It adds that 54 percent of the sexually active population in Zimbabwe practice modern methods of family planning with 6 percent using traditional ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey also notes that 47 percent of Zimbabwe's sexually active population use the female methods of contraception while only 6 percent used male methods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bureau says 38 percent of Zimbabwean men engage in sexual intercourse by the age of 18 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Egypt, Ghana, Kenya and Malawi, the average family in Zimbabwe has four children while West African countries tend to have more children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey also notes a high percentage of polygamous marriages in West Africa and, in particular, Senegal with 37 percent of all marriages being polygamous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Zimbabwe, 8 percent of married men are in polygamous marriages. Egypt has the lowest number of polygamous marriages with just 2 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the bureau notes that polygamous marriages produce fewer children than in monogamous ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example in Cameroon, the average family size among polygamous marriages is 16 children compared to an average of 10 in monogamous marriages.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Local Zambian election monitors declared Wednesday that the country's second multiparty elections held Monday were neither free nor fair due to limited voter participation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Incumbent president Frederick Chiluba and his Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) were reported to he heading for a landslide victory as final result of the polls were being collated late Wednesday.  The Committee for a Clean Campaign, which comprises several local election monitors and some civil society organizations, said that the election schedules had also highly disadvantaged the opposition parties and independent candidates.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Committee Chairman Ngande Mwanajiti said at a news conference that only 2.3 million voters had been registered out of an estimated 4.6 million eligible.  But only 1.1 million had managed to collect voters cards for the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that lack of inter-party dialogue between the MMD and the opposition had exacerbated a mood of uncertainty and undermined the entire electoral process.  &quot;The opposition parties were unable to gain mileage on any of the substantive issues,&quot; he said. &quot;Lack of preparedness was also exhibited by the Independent Electoral Commission which had fixed the elections on the day of appointment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He charged that the commission had failed to win the confidence of the major players. He alleged that the MMD and the opposition Zambia Democratic Congress were involved in rampant vote buying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The housing policy of MMD is certainly welcome, but the timing reveals that the exercise had a severe impact on the elections,&quot; Mwanajiti said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The examination of the elections results were determined, he said, by the voter registration, elections schedule, campaign activities, media coverage and election day itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that the campaign activities were characterized by misinformation, slander and other practices which are incompatible with democratic practice and acceptable international norms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 20 foreign monitors and observers were in the country to oversee the electoral process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They included the Organization of African Unity, personal representatives of the United Nations secretary-general, and church representatives from Europe, the United States and within Africa. These have not given their views on the conduct of the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the government has denied it manipulated the polls.  The MMD campaign committee chairman, Vernon Mwaanga, told a press briefing that it was not true that the government had failed to register an estimated 4.6 million eligible voters, a figure he said was unrealistic.  He said it was unfair for the committee to pass judgement on the elections even before all the results had been declared.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MBABANE, Swaziland (PANA) - A Swazi beauty queen and a South Africa man have been arrested in separate incidents in Swaziland on charges of illegal possession of drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mtombi Mngomezulu, winner of the last year's Swaziland Woman of Africa Award was arrested along with a man and a local taxi driver in Manzini, after she had collected a parcel at the local post office.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman said Thursday police acting on a tip off, intercepted the taxi and on examining Mngomezulu's parcel found more than one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of cocaine powder hidden in a secret pocket inside a small leather folder- type handbag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mngomezulu and the co-accused are due to appear in Manzini magistrates court on Friday, the police spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The penalty for illegal possession of drugs which is a non- bailable offence in Swaziland, is 15 years imprisonment or a fine of 15,000 rands (about 3,363 dollars) for first offenders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A front page story on the arrests in Thursday's Times of Swaziland said Mngomezulu was due to have left the country on Wednesday as chaperon to the current Woman of Africa' (Swaziland) Miss Sizakele Shongwe, who is featuring at the regional contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police also reported the arrest of a South African, Elvis Manzini, aged 27 years, after he was found with 50 grams (2 ounces) of metaphetamina powder hidden in his clothing as he entered Swaziland from Mozambique at the northern Lomahasha border on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KINSHASA, Zaire (PANA) - Gen. Eluki Monga Aungu, Chief-of-staff of the Zairean armed forces, has been suspended, Zairean television announced on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the reasons for this suspension have not been given, a member of the Zairean information minister's office, who required anonymity, told PANA that &quot;the general's views were too different from those of the government and the ministry of national defence&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eluki blamed the recent rout of the Zairean army in eastern Zaire by rebel ethnic Tutsis on the &quot;lack of support from the government&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His statement, made at a news conference, led to the deterioration of relations between the army command and the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, Eluki, on an inspection tour of the northwestern provinces of Upper-Zaire and Maniema, near the North-Kivu province, described as &quot;useless the deployment of a foreign force in Kivu, since the Zairean army can recapture the occupied territory&quot;, the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political analysts in Zaire were expecting the general's suspension following the routing of his troops and open differences between the executive and the military hierarchy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the suspension raises fears since the army is seen as the real holder of power in Zaire, where it has the reputation of being &quot;at the sole service of Marshal Mobutu&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was probably on his recent visit to President Mobutu, who is recovering from surgery for prostate cancer in France, that Prime Minister Kengo Wa Dondo was given the go-ahead to suspend Eluki, sources said in Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The irregular migrants, who have been in Ghana since September 1995, are fleeing the 13-year-old civil war between the Sudan Peoples' Liberation Army and the Khartoum government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legal officer in Ghana for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Ron Mponda, told the Ghana News Agency in Accra Thursday, that the migrants claimed to have chosen to live in Ghana because of the peace prevailing here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said it would be illegal for the U.N. agency to grant them refugee status. Under international law, one can only seek refugee status in one's neighbouring country unless that country is also facing some political upheaval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These people have crossed over five boarders to come to Ghana,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said they could have gone to one of the nine neighbouring countries whose citizens enjoy absolute peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see no reason why they should travel all the way to Ghana,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meeting in the Sudanese capital Wednesday, the Secretariat for Coordination and Mobilization in the congress called on every Sudanese to help raise the money for the army and popular defence forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government-owned daily newspaper, Al Engaz Al Watani, reported Thursday that public participation in the fund raising drive would demonstrate &quot;that the Sudanese people accept the challenge and are able to resist&quot; their enemies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Embassy in Khartoum said last week that Washington had earmarked 15 million dollars for military defence equipment for Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda to help them fight anti-government rebels being backed by Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newspaper said Sudanese anti-government forces, belonging to the Democratic Alliance Forces, were operating from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda.  Khartoum claims that the alliance has been attacking Sudanese border garrisons from bases in Eritrea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political parties dissolved, when President Omar Al Bashir seized power in 1989, have joined hands recently with the Sudan People's Liberation Army, operating in southern Sudan, and the Alliance Forces recently to try and overthrow the government with force of arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The secretary for mobilization and coordination of the National Congress, Adil Awad, said that congress was &quot;considering practical arrangements&quot; to boycott products of the countries supporting the punishment of the Khartoum government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The measure will be immediately effective if the Security Council issues any more sanctions against Sudan,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This weekend, the U.N. Security Council will consider the implementation of an earlier decision to ban external flights of Sudan Airways. This is in punishment for what the council maintains is Sudan's involvement in a bid to kill Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, in 1995 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The money was used to set up the program and pay for 126 projects for some 1,700 former rebels, Northern Province Governor Mahamadou Diagouraga said at a news conference.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initiated in May, the programme aims at reintegrating within 18 months about 9,000 former fighters from the various movements of the Tuareg rebellion and the Ghanda-Koye Black Patriotic Movement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first phase of the program, which ended Oct. 1, centered on paying demobilization allowances totalling 640 million cfa (1.28 million dollars).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diagouraga said that each of the 9,000 fighters registered under the peace agreements had been paid 105,000 cfa (210 dollars).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - South Africa's bank rate was increased by 1 percent Thursday, in the wake of a slow but steady increase in inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Stals, the governor of the Reserve Bank (South Africa's central bank), has announced a decision to raise the country's bank rate from 16 percent to 17 percent. This increase will inevitably be followed by increases in mortgage, overdraft and hire-purchase rates, and will more than likely dampen hopes of a bumper christmas spending season. The decision to increase the bank rate was influenced by figures released Thursday by the country's Central Statistical Services. These show that South Africa's inflation rate has reached 9.2 percent and is creeping dangerously close to double figures once again.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stals said decisive action had been necessary to depress the inflationary pressures arising from excessive depreciation of the rand over the past year.  This had to be done to restore both external and internal financial stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local economists have described the decision to increase the bank rate just before Christmas as a brave step.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It shows just how serious the country's economic plight is,&quot; said a senior banker, &quot;but when everything is considered, I think it is a good decision for the longer term.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African Chamber of Business (SACOB) said the decision to increase the bank rate was to be expected but the tightening of monetary policy constituted a severe blow to short-term economic prospects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While SACOB appreciates the reason for the step,&quot; said Ben Van Rensburg, director of Economic Policy, &quot;a rise in interest rates at this time will have a negative effect on business and consumer confidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group welcomed on Thursday the release of three Nigerian human rights activists, but criticized the military regime in Abuja for denying the group access to meet detained opposition leader Moshood Abiola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a press conference in Harare after a two-day visit to Nigeria, the group's chairman and Zimbabwe Foreign Affairs Minister, Stan Mudenge, said the release of the three was a positive development towards Nigeria's respect of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We welcome the releases announced yesterday of three detained persons,&quot; he said. &quot;At the same time, we regret that we are unable to visit any detainees, including Chief Abiola.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three included one of Nigeria's human rights leaders, Gani Fawehinmi, whose wife and the United States government have been lobbying for his release because of ill-health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eight-nation group has been calling for the release of all those detained without trial in Nigeria. The Nigerian government has since June released 23 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mudenge said the group comprising Britain, Canada, Ghana, Jamaica, Malaysia, New Zealand, South Africa and Zimbabwe would continue to press for the release of Abiola and other detainees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abiola has been in detention on treason charges since June 1994 for declaring himself president on the first anniversary of the election which he claimed to have won, but which was annulled by the former military regime of Gen. Ibrahim Babangida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While in Nigeria, the group met the military ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, traditional rulers, representatives of five opposition political parties, heads of various transitional institutions and chairman of the National Human Rights Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement released after the three-hour meeting, Abacha called &quot;for equity, justice and understanding in handling internal problems of member states in keeping with the original objectives which informed the setting up of the historic body of British colonies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged Commonwealth member states to strengthen the organization and hold regular meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth in November 1995 following the execution of a human rights activist and eight other Ogoni leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commonwealth Ministerial Group, set up at the November Commonwealth meeting in New Zealand, was mandated to investigate human rights abuses in Nigeria and monitor progress towards a return to democratic and civilian rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mudenge dispelled rumors that the group was divided over the Nigerian issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are only meeting in the new year to analyze the information we have and make recommendations and it is only then that we might know whether there is a division or not. At the moment, there is no division,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the rebels dared to attack the country again, they will be crushed and followed up to their bases,&quot; he told journalists at Mpondwe border post, in Kasese, the last area to be secured by the Uganda Peoples Defence Forces on the border with Zaire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ADF is a combination of Ugandan a Moslem fundamentalist sect reportedly funded by the government of Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clad in a military uniform and carrying an AK-47 rifle, Museveni said: &quot;We respect our neighbors sovereignty and territory. But those who attack us will be dealt with severely.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his government had got in touch with President Mobutu Sese Seko to arrange a meeting between the two governments. &quot;We want to talk to the Zairean government to find measures to deal with the problem of Zaire-based Ugandan dissidents who attacked the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said more than 200 rebels had been killed during the one week of bitter fighting and several of them arrested. He did not give the number of those rebels arrested.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwe Friday accused the United States of being undemocratic by blocking the renewal of Boutros Boutros-Ghali's bid for a second term of office as United Nations secretary-general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Robert Mugabe said his government continued to support the candidacy of Boutros-Ghali despite the U.S. position.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are very critical of the Americans. It is something we cannot accept.  How can one nation dictate to the world like this?&quot; Mugabe told journalists. &quot; The world should read from this lesson...the practice is not democratic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States this week voted against a second five-year term for Boutros-Ghali. The other 14 members of the Security Council voted for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American government accused the Egyptian, whose term expires on Dec. 31, of being too slow in pushing U.N. reforms and threatened that his candidacy would further delay U.S. payment of the 1.4 billion dollars it owes to the world body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three African members of the Security Council, Botswana, Egypt and Guinea-Bissau, are consulting with African states on the way forward.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe on Friday said his government will not be &quot;bullied&quot; by dismissed nurses and junior doctors into re-engaging, saying they should first re-apply as directed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the nurses and junior doctors had shown indiscipline by striking in the first place, leaving patients dying in hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot be bullied by any arm of the civil service. That is ...  indiscipline and we would like to put a stop to it,&quot; Mugabe said in an interview with journalists.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the government position was still that the dismissed doctors and nurses should re-apply and go back to work before negotiations can start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We expect the nurses to come back to work in the manner we have prescribed.  They should write and appeal. Their issue of salaries does not just relate to them, it relates to others in the civil service as well and we are aware of that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nurses, went on strike on Oct. 21 demanding that government look into their demands for increased night duty allowances and the introduction of risk allowance. They were joined by junior doctors 10 days later, who want better working conditions and on-call allowances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But government dismissed 2,000 nurses and 300 junior doctors and so far only 153 nurses and 10 foreign doctors who were wrongfully dismissed, have appealed against their dismissals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe said it was up to the dismissed health workers to follow the channels that had been prescribed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government, he said, had now committed itself to review the salaries of all civil servants every year with a view of improving them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The salaries are low and every year we should be looking to try and improve them,&quot; he said. &quot;This is why we have committed ourselves to pay them 60 percent increments staggered over three years since last year. We will continue to do that until we are satisfied.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile the dismissed health workers on Friday said they would not re- apply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have sent a letter to public service, labor and social welfare minister Florence Chitauro asking for their terminal benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We wish to advise the government that after exhausting all channels in trying to reach an amicable solution to the health crisis, we feel that time has arrived to ask for our terminal benefits,&quot; the letter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot procrastinate this decision as it will compromise health delivery. Re-applying is out of the question as we have stated time and again.  &quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thursday's Times of Swaziland quoted Swaziland police spokesman, Inspector Paul Zishwili, confirming Miss Mngomezulu's arrest in Manzini and that she was being held in custody pending her appearance in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When PANA checked with the police independently concerning the Times of Swaziland story the police did not suggest there was any error in the report.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior police drugs unit officer added that Miss Ngomezulu was arrested along with a Nigerian illegal immigrant, Pascal Nelson Nnaboike and a Swazi taxi driver after she had collected an express delivery parcel at the Manzini post office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On inspection by police the parcel which had been sent from Brazil was found to contain over 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of cocaine powder hidden in a secret pocket in a leather folder type handbag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was surprise and confusion last night when Mngomezulu, telephoned the Swaziland television studios Thursday night during a news broadcast denying her arrest and stating she was in fact in Johannesburg as chaperon to Swaziland's competitor in this year's Woman of Africa regional contest in Johannesburg, Sizakele Shongwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swaziland police this morning for the first time denied the Times of Swaziland report Thursday that the arrested Ntombi Mngomezulu was the former Woman of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the police denials are countered by the Times sources at the University of Swaziland where the former award winner, Ntombi works in the library.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper's editor told PANA Friday they will continue to investigate the possibility of a cover up of the latter's involvement in drugs as she is related to the royal family. Certain members or close associates of the royal family were also rumored to have been involved in drugs smuggling earlier this year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - The Nigerian military government has named a multi- sectorial 170-member committee to chart a new economic course for the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team, set up Monday to fashion the country's economic blueprint, labelled &quot;Vision 2010,&quot; is headed by Ernest Shonekan, businessman and former head of the Interim National Government in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has as members 10 serving ministers, as well as former ministers, technocrats, captains of industry, traditional rulers, media representatives and academics.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministers on the committee are those of finance, petroleum resources, industry, national planning, science and technology, agriculture, power and steel, transport, communications and education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 40 economists in the team, include Sam Aluko, Pius Okigbo and at least eight foreigners, among them, Brian Anderson of Shell Petroleum Development Corporation, Jim Massey of Mobil, Ingvar Heide of Elf and Theo Oerlements of the Liquefied Natural Gas of Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those from the media are Wada Maida, managing director of the News Agency of Nigeria and Peter Enahoro, administrator of the mass circulation Daily Times of Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also 11 women on the committee including, former Commerce and Tourism Minister Bola Kuforiji-Olubi; Grace Alele Williams, a former university vice-chancellor and Alhaja Abibatu Mogoji, of the Lagos Market Women Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation with some 100 million people, has since independence in 1960 seen its economy shift from an agrarian to an oil- dependent one, after the country struck the so-called black gold in the 1970s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oil now accounts for at least 80 percent of the country's total foreign exchange earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee was to be inaugurated Wednesday by Nigerian head of state, Gen. Sani Abacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To strengthen its economic programme, the Abacha regime has held two annual economic summits in which Shonekan, the man Abacha removed from office in November 1993, has served as a key player.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, the military government has won qualified support even from critics for its economic reform policies, which have led to a reduction in inflation and relative stability of the national currency, the naira.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwe will continue trading in Ivory products even during the forthcoming convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), a senior government official said Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Willis Makombe, acting director of national parks, said ivory carvers and traders were bracing up for anticipated high demand during the CITES meeting to be held in June, 1997 in Harare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today Zimbabwe trades locally in ivory that is why we have ivory articles in the shops and each time there is an international conference business is brisk,&quot; he told a meeting of the Wildlife Society.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said, the government was going to put up signs in the shops dealing in ivory to warn foreign buyers that it was possible their articles could be confiscated in their home countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want the delegates to check with their countries first before they buy the ivory articles,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ivory trade, especially in Southern Africa, is embroiled in controversy as the international community insists that elephants should remain listed on appendix 1, banning utilisation and trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Southern African countries meeting August in Maseru, Lesotho, unanimously agreed to press for the downgrading of the elephant from appendix 1 to 2 which would allow for sustainable utilisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike in other African countries where the elephant population is threatened with extinction due to poaching activities and mismanagement of wildlife resources, most of Southern Africa has accrued a huge population that is now resulting in animal-human conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For instance, Zimbabwe has a herd of at least 60,000 while its carrying capacity is about 30,000 elephant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are fears the downgrading would trigger illegal trade and poaching would resurface.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As government, we are aware that there could be repercussions to the downgrading but we are ready for that,&quot; Makombe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intensive lobbying among the African countries was underway, he said, and Environment and Tourism Deputy Minister Edward Chindori-Chininga had just returned from a two-week trip to West Africa to drum up support for the downgrading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, Zimbabwe has ivory stocks worth millions of dollars and the ivory is accumulating at about five tons every year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Government believes that wildlife resources should be utilized for the economic benefit of the country,&quot; Makombe said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The Zimbabwe Tourism Authority says it is embarking on an aggressive marketing drive in Europe and Asia to promote the country as a premier tourist destination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporting this Wednesday, the Zimbabwe Inter-Africa News Agency said the authority's newly appointed chief executive, Joseph Chigwedere, has proposed to work on niche market areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The major market focus will be on Germany, whose nationals are known worldwide for their passion for travel. The United States and Australia are also targets for Zimbabwe's marketing drive. The authority has identified these countries as likely to be the fastest growing source of tourists for Zimbabwe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are getting about three flights a week from Australia and we think by the end of the century, we will have daily flights, either ending up in Johannesburg or Harare,&quot; Chigwedere said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The marketing campaign will also be carried out in Britain, still a major source of tourists for Zimbabwe, as well as the Far East, with particular attention being paid to such countries as Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chigwedere said the authority will also target the Arab world, encouraging wealthy tourists from Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates to visit Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We also want to develop the regional and domestic market. South Africa, because of its proximity, is still a significant market for us but we have to be selective and identify markets which are high-yielding but low volume,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The local market is also important and we are trying to instill a culture of taking a holiday, particularly among the young blacks,&quot; he added. &quot;It is critical that we develop the local tourists for us to prosper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the authority will be registering all tourist establishment and ensure that standards were maintained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will help indigenous Zimbabweans wanting to enter the tourism industry, currently the fastest growing in the country, with annual earnings exceeding 100 million U.S. dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1995, at least one million visitors came to Zimbabwe, mostly from Germany, the United States, Britain, South Africa and Zambia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambia's opposition will soon mount non-violent country-wide demonstrations in protest against the newly elected government of President Frederick Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing this in a press conference Wednesday, the chairman of the Opposition Alliance, which groups eight political parties, Roger Chongwe, claimed Chiluba's government was &quot;illegitimately&quot; elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the joint press conference also addressed by former President Kenneth Kaunda, Chongwe said the demonstrations were aimed at sensitizing and drawing attention to a 'sham and fraudulent&quot; electoral process.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chongwe demanded for an interim government to be formed, saying the alliance will not recognize Chiluba's government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chiluba must earn the respect of the people. We are appealing to the public to agree to the proposal of an interim arrangement to oversee the electoral process,&quot; Chongwe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He condemned government's continued attack and harassment of the local monitoring teams which have declared the Nov. 18 elections not free and fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The call by Chiluba to put the police and army on alert is abuse of power by those in authority. Since when did Zambians vote with armed para-military officers manning the polling stations? If chiluba was popularly elected, why has he now turned to the military and not the people? It becomes dangerous when a government relies on the military,&quot; Chongwe noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He charged that the elections were not free and fair and that is why the international community had boycotted monitoring the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He named the United Nations, the Carter Foundation, National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, the European Community, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany and the West-minister Foundation as some of the organizations that had refused to monitor the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda charged at the same press conference that the United States, Britain, Japan and Sweden whom the government has accused of funding local monitoring teams to declare the elections not free and fair, were being &quot;insulted&quot; by Chiluba's government for supposedly interfering in Zambia's internal affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These donors are being insulted by Chiluba right, left and center. Chiluba thinks I am so powerful that I just told the US, Britain, Sweden and Japan that Chiluba is bad, stop giving him aid. How can Chiluba think I am that powerful, who am I?,&quot; Kaunda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda who quoted Chiluba's speech at the 1992 OAU summit in Senegal where he had called on the OAU to intervene in African countries which were not practicing good governance, wondered why Chiluba was now criticizing regional leaders who commented on Zambia's political impasse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alliance at the same press conference revealed that more people who had not registered had voted during the just-ended elections. Statistics quoted from the Electoral Commission and released at the press conference revealed that the percentage of people who voted were more than those registered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the constituencies cited was the northern Mansa constituency where a total of 12,322 votes were said to have been cast while the total number of registered voters was 10,145.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alliance, which comprises Kaunda's United National Independence Party and seven minor political parties had boycotted the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambia Democratic Congress which participated in the elections said after the results that the elections were rigged. The congress also announced that it will not recognize Chiluba's government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last August, the government issued a licence authorizing Esso, a U.S.-based oil conglomerate, to exploit an oil reserve off the coast of Pointe-Noire in southern Congo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shell of the U.K. and ELF of France also operate in the same area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the contract, the government would get 40 percent of crude oil when total total production does not exceed 100 million barrels. Esso would retain 60 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if crude production ranged between 100 million and 200 million barrels, the share of the Congolese state would rise to 42 percent against 58 percent for Esso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If production is between 200 and 300 million barrels, Congo's quota would be 44 percent and Esso 56 percent, but if the crude exceeds 300 million barrels, Congo would get 46 percent against 54 percent for Esso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under another article of the contract, Esso is required to pay Congo a bonus of three million dollars and to contribute funds towards development projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American company is also to provide about one million dollars to finance a social project and a similar amount for development projects in northern Congo's Cuvette Basin.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - South Africa has tightened its border health control measures after recording its first Ebola-related death Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move is aimed at preventing the general spread of deadly infectious diseases to and from the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action follows the death here on Sunday night of the first person in South Africa to contract the dreaded Ebola fever, which results in the death of up to 90 percent of its victims.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was a 46-year-old nursing sister - Mrs. Marilyn Lahana - who contracted Ebola fever after treating a Gabonese doctor late October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African National Department of Health has communicated the new regulations to representatives of companies which airlift patients into South Africa from other African countries for medical treatment and with the agencies which organize medical treatment for foreigners in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further discussions on the measures are to be discussed during meetings on ways of ensuring effective cross-border control of infectious diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of the World Health Organisation initiative to revise global measures on how to control infectious diseases across borders - Dr. Brian Gushulak - will address the meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, everyone suspected of having been in contact with either the Gabonese doctor or Mrs. Lahana is still being closely monitored, but none of the 300-plus people involved have shown signs of developing Ebola fever yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Gauteng Health Department director for AIDS and communicable diseases, Dr. Liz Floyd, has warned that further cases could still develop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is an anxious time for the people on the monitoring programmes,&quot; she said. &quot;We have our fingers crossed, but we are not out of the critical 21-day period yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebola is considered one of the most dangerous viruses in the world because so little is known about it. It is transmitted through close contact with body fluids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first major outbreak of Ebola occurred in Zaire in 1995 when more than 250 people died of the disease.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - With the last two bodies recovered from the wreck of the Ethiopian Boeing 767 jet which crashed Saturday near the island of Grand Comoro, the airline released Thursday, the names and nationalities of the 50 survivors and 125 victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eleven survivors were also flown Thursday to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from Nairobi, Kenya, where they were later discharged from hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fifteen other survivors have remained in Nairobi for further treatment.  Another 23 survivors are under hospitalization in the French territory of Reunion, some 2,400 kilometres south-east of the Comoros.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jetliner was hijacked Saturday by three Ethiopians, minutes after it took off from Addis Ababa for Abidjan in Cote D'ivoire. It was to make transit stops in Nairobi, Brazzaville and Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hijackers ordered the captain to fly them to Australia. But refusing to believe the captain had fuel only for a flight of one-and-a-half hours, they forced the pilot to remain in the air until the plane ran out of fuel and crashed near Moroni, capital of the Comoros.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last two corpses recovered were an Ethiopian and a Nigerian. All three hijackers were among the dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopians, with 22 dead, head the list of victims from 37 countries. There were nine Ethiopian survivors, among them the captain and co-pilot. Five flight attendants were among the dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numerically, Nigerians are second on the list of the dead. Only four of the 22 Nigerians on board survived. Among the 21 Indian passengers seven survived, among them an infant. Two of the 12 Malians also survived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All nine Sri Lankans died as did eight of the 14 Kenyan passengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number of victims from Congo has been revised to three with two survivors. Seven of the eight Israelis died while two of the five Britons survived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other survivors were from Italy (4), United States (4) and one dead, Ukraine (3) and one dead, Liberia (2) and two dead, two each from Benin and Sweden survived. One Japanese survived and another died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following 18 countries each lost one national:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chad, Cote D'Ivoire, Egypt, Germany, Hungary, Korea (south), Lesotho, Liberia, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Sweden, Somalia, Yemen and Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The remaining task is of positive identification of the remaining corpses.  Then, they will be placed in coffins, already purchased in Kenya and South Africa and taken to Moroni. These corpses will then be flown, either from Addis Ababa or Moroni, to the homes of the victims for proper burial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of mourners, including media colleagues, turned up both at the late journalist's residence and at the muslim cemetery in the Kenyan capital, to pay their last respects.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, President Daniel Arap Moi has sent a message of condolence to the president and the people of Hungary following the tragic death of the country's ambassador to Kenya, Antal Annus, in the same plane crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annus was returning to Nairobi from Addis Ababa in the ill-fated plane after presenting his credentials to the Ethiopian government. He was seriously injured in the crash and died in a Nairobi hospital while undergoing treatment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KINSHASA, Zaire (PANA) - Zairian radical opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi returned here Wednesday and reaffirmed he has been asked by President Mobutu Sese Seko to form a government of national unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His claim was refuted by Mobutu a few days ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his return, Tshisekedi, the leader of the Union for Democracy and Social progress, was cheered by at least 10,000 of his supporters who had lined up along the Patrice Lumumba Boulevard linking the Ndjili airport to east Kinshasa, where his party's headquarters is located.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former prime minister returned from a week-long visit in France where he visited Mobutu, who is recovering from prostate cancer surgery in Cap Saint-Martin, near Monaco principality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition leader's return was being eagerly awaited in the Zairian capital following his claim, after his meeting with Mobutu last Thursday, that he had been given &quot;full powers to form a government of national unity&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said the conflict in eastern Zaire was an &quot;internal Zairian affair&quot; which should be settled through talks with rebel leader Laurent Kabila. He finally said that Prime Minister Kengo Wa Dondo's cabinet was a &quot;Government of the West&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tshisekedi's claim was denied 24 hours after he made it by Ngbanda Atumba, a special advisor to Mobutu. He challenged Tshisekedi to prove that he discussed political issues with the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its reaction to Tshisekedi's call for talks with Kabila, the Zairian government said it had decided to take sue him in court, describing the move as &quot;treason&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, in a statement read Tuesday on Zairian television, the Zairian information minister, Boguo Makeli, denied a widespread rumor here that Tshisekedi was arrested on his return from France.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to reports from Algiers, soldiers, communal guards and self- defence groups have been put on maximum alert and are patrolling towns and villages.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The forces are very &quot;visible&quot; in the hinterland, especially in the Algiers region, where members of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) are concentrated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers in the Algerian capital say that unlike during the 1995 presidential election, the army seems to have taken the backstage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, communal guards and armed civilians are on the forefront of the alert and their numbers could reach 200,000 men, according to independent sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The security forces will be in charge of guarding the 8,000 polling stations. With three million inhabitants, Algiers is the largest constituency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to reports, several road blocks have been put up at the entrance to major towns since Monday and were reinforced Thursday by armored vehicles.  In Algiers and the Algiers region, the road blocks have been in place for months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lately, bloody attacks by armed groups have intensified. In the first three weeks of November, 150 people were reported killed in a series of massacres.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - South Africa will sever diplomatic ties with the Republic of China (Taiwan) and establish full diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China (mainland China), next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pretoria's new position marks a departure from President Nelson Mandela's reported undertaking to visiting Taiwanese Vice Premier Hsu Li-teh in August this year that South Africa would not break diplomatic relations with Taiwan in favour of mainland China.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing the decision Tuesday, Mandela expressed regret because Taiwan had given its support to South Africa's transition to democracy, and to the country's reconstruction and development programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela's African National Congress government had inherited its recognition of Taiwan from the white-dominated regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to President Mandela, continuation of this situation was &quot; inconsistent with the country's role in international affairs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African leader said his Government would not abandon relations with Taiwan overnight, but would arrange a smooth transition which would lead to an eventual end of diplomatic relations by the end of next year. He added that all other relations with Taiwan would remain intact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president explained that the possibility of dual recognition had been ruled out after it had become evident that this was unacceptable to Beijing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the president justified the decision to the fact that the People's Republic of China is a major player in world affairs recognized by virtually all major countries in the world. The two governments would soon hold talks on the establishment of an embassy in South Africa, he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambian President Frederick Chiluba who was re- elected last week for a second and last term in office 10 days ago, dissolved the cabinet on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A state house spokesman quoted the president as saying that ministries will be run by permanent secretaries until the a new cabinet is appointed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His Ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) emerged victorious in the Nov. 18 general elections, in which it scooped 131 of the 150 parliamentary seats at stake.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten seats went to independent candidates, five to the National Party, and two each to the Zambia Democratic Congress and Agenda for Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba managed to get almost all his cabinet ministers back into parliament. Only two cabinet and two deputy ministers lost in the parliamentary elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government had lost 11 members of his first cabinet, appointed in 1991, within a period of two years through resignations. Among those who resigned was Vice-President Levy Mwanawasa. The ministers who left alleged that the government was corrupt and that some of their colleagues were involved in drugs trafficking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the opposition Agenda for Zambia has called for fresh elections and urgent formation of an interim government to resolve contentious issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party's president, Akashambatwa Mbikusita Lewanika, declared at a press briefing Thursday in Lusaka that the just-ended elections were not free and fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a matter of fact and not opinion that the elections failed the test of the democratic process and they were not free and fair or just for all the stake-holders,&quot; Lewanika claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Nov. 18 elections, which President Frederick Chiluba had declared as free and fair, were unacceptable and undemocratic to the Zambian people since the electoral process was manipulated to &quot;cheat and get the results that Chiluba desired to have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are requesting that an interim government be established and come up with a new constitution and electoral process and also resolve other outstanding issues before fresh elections take place,&quot; Lewanika said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lewanika came fourth to Chiluba in the presidential elections contested by five candidates. His party got only two of the 150 parliamentary seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambia Democratic Congress and the Opposition Alliance, which consists of eight political parties, have also declared that the elections were not free and fair and that they will not recognize Chiluba's government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former President Kenneth Kaunda's United National Independence Party, which is a member of the alliance, intends to hold non-violent country-wide demonstrations in protest against the government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The only game in town right now is the one played by millions and perfected by a small handful, which happens to include Ernie Els and Wayne Westner. I only know that because I checked out the World Cup of Golf site (http://www.wcgolf.com/narrowcast/welcome.ht ml), which went up shortly before the tournament, won by the South African duo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The site itself earned several hundred thousand visits during its brief stay on top of the South African web hit parade, proving that golfing fans have not neglected the Internet while glued to live TV broadcasts. In fact, when you peruse golfing sites on the web, you notice a strange anomaly: golfing sites consistently boast larger graphics - and often more system- hungry added extras that demand added extra plug- ins for your browser - than almost any other sporting category on the Internet.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There can be only one conclusions from this observation: the designers of golf sites assume their prospective visitors fall in the income category that dictates fast, high-end computers with high-speed links to the Internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If that is the case, then the rest of this column is safe for the golfing classes only. The rest of you can come along, but mind the heavy system demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Cup of Golf site may have served its purpose, but it remains a useful resource for those who want to go over the action again, or get some insight into just how South Africa ran away with the title. It features Real Audio broadcasts from the tournament, Quicktime Virtual Reality (that's one of the plug-ins you need, and even video footage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The guide to the Erinvale Country Estate and Golf Club is meant to include 3-D flyovers of each hole, but perhaps my browser was just too low-class to find them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This weekend, the single most important golfing site in the world is the 1996 Nedbank Million Dollar Golf Challenge (http://www.milliondollar.co.za/).  Again, you have to dodge the graphics: the opening menu can only be accessed via a vast image map, no less than 62kb in size, with no text option for the bandwidth-less-abled. The big added extra here is a Million Dollar Golf Challenge screensaver for Windows 95, a mere 11,5Mb in size. That dwarfs the funky map of the course, at a mere 100kb, from which you can access details and photos of any of the holes, drinking holes and accommodation options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The menu aside, the information design of the site is excellent, with quick access to the basic facts and figures which, after all, is what a site like this is intended to provide. There are many superb international golfing sites on the web (mostly with big graphics), but to find out more you'll have to visit the online version of this column at http://www.mg.co.za/mg/pc/pcrev ie1.htm</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Nigel Bruce has been editor of Finance Week for 10 days now after jumping ship from rival publication Financial Mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce does not feel he has to excuse his abrupt move uptown to the ailing Finance Week: &quot;I had absolutely no choice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Days before he handed in his letter of resignation, Bruce and Times Media Limited (TML) managing director Roy Paulson talked about the Finance Week takeover. Against Paulson's instructions, Bruce allowed one of his columnists, David Gleason, who was about to take up the reins at Finance Week, to write a farewell column in the Financial Mail.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a dramatic move and after months of speculation and denial, Gleason took over Finance Week and is the single largest shareholder in the company. Bruce, who is now also a shareholder, said at the time of his disagreement with Paulson that it was his prerogative to use whomever he wished for editorial contributions. That brought to a head the already turbulent relationship between Paulson and himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was clear that I would have to leave TML at some stage as it had become difficult to work there with a board and managing director with no publishing instincts and no idea of the criteria to be used when making senior editorial appointments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce does not pull any punches as he sits in his stark office, no paintings on the wall, surrounded by simple and cheap office furniture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He first attacks Johnnic, the holding company of TML which, he says, has a &quot; history&quot; to it, one sure to overshadow the current board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The board of directors of TML, on which Johannesburg Consolidated Investments is strongly represented, never appeared to have any interest in the editorial quality of the newspapers or in the political developments that shaped them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce is adamant that TML's managers do not have their priorities in order.  &quot;Instead of investing in Financial Mail and Business Day, they chose to starve the business publications. What do they do? They invest in a popular magazine division and a girlie magazine (Playboy); the latter of which has since closed down. None of those magazines, as far as I know, are making a profit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce cannot resist picking holes in the stable that he was affiliated to for 21 years, 11 of which he spent at the helm of Financial Mail. &quot;Solid management is lacking all round,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes that the takeover by the National Empowerment Consortium (NEC), headed by Cyril Ramaphosa, is likely to be problematic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problems are already beginning to loom ... We have a chairman (Vaughn Bray) and an managing director (Paulson) who form a cosy cabal. We will have to see whom the board decides to appoint as managing director after Paulson retires. Also, the pending Financial Times/ Pearsons Group deal is an issue of dissent,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce argues that &quot;at no point&quot; did the NEC talk to him about its feelings regarding editorial independence. &quot;For over a year, no one came to discuss the issue which concerned all TML editors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce was involved in drafting an editorial charter long before the deal was concluded in an effort to &quot;preserve the traditions of all the newspapers&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only through strong shareholding can the traditions be preserved,&quot; he says, adding that that is lacking in the current board's composition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruce does not seem to be liked by many colleagues in his profession. When talking to him you can see why. He comes across as brash, pompous and a strong contender for the &quot;I am always right&quot; award. If he can help it, he does not hand out compliments. He has the following to say about two key people who are the new owners of TML.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the chairman of Johnnic, Ramaphosa, he says: &quot;He may be a good unionist but when it comes to commerce and business he is an innocent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the chairman of New Africa Investments Limited, Nthato Motlana: &quot;If you are not laudatory towards him, he accuses one of racism. He has not got the foggiest idea of what his business is about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a first interview since he changed publications, Nigel Bruce spoke frankly about his new role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What do you plan to do with Finance Week?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I plan to make it a rip-roaring success in the business arena. We plan to cater for those readers with disposable income at the top end of the market.  Our coverage of stories will be more controversial, while at the same time, an entertaining read. We also plan to increase our editorial staff but have not as yet approached any of the Financial Mail's (FM) staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How much will it cost and how long will it take to overtake the FM on circulation/advertising?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't think it will be necessary to overtake the FM in order to make our mark. Yes, our circulation and advertising will be increased in due course but I don't think it is necessary to compete outright with the FM which is aiming, according to Business Day, at reaching a younger and larger black market. Capital is not an issue as the newspaper is well-financed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What was your biggest failure at the FM?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not being able to manage shareholders sufficiently to allow them to understand their political susceptibilities which led to their sale of Times Media Limited (TML). I also feel I failed by not seeing TML's business titles become international but I had no support from the managerial staff. I was unable to forge relations abroad as well as edit a publication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had TML stayed in white hands would that have affected your decision to stay?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not an issue of colour. Secure ownership in accord with the editorial traditions of a newspaper is important. My concern at the time was the editorial independence of TML publications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the appointment of Cyril (Ramaphosa), when they made threatening remarks, they did not at any time discuss whatever reservations they may have had with the editors concerned. Had TML remained a secure company, I would have reconsidered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Who should succeed you at FM and why?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't know whom they have in mind but I know that the Financial Times favours Peter Bruce (editor of Business Report) as a likely candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What are you able to do at Finance Week that you were unable to do at the FM?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am now able to create incentives for colleagues. At the FM I looked after my editorial colleagues in ways about which the managing director knew very little. I was able to use an ambitious and profitable surveys programme, paying my colleagues an additional fee for doing this freelance work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What are your thoughts on the newly formed South African National Editors' Forum?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a bad thing when editors of newspapers want to regulate the industry.  It seems they are eager to form some sort of guild. Newspapers have to cater for the demands of the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You cannot trade off white editors' concerns about press freedom against unqualified commitments to implement affirmative action when it might not be appropriate in the market concerned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Television news has an average of six Audience Ratings (ARs) and just manages to slip into the All Media and Product Survey (AMPS) figures of the top 10 television programmes on the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) channels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But six ARs, according to media directors from local advertising agencies, is &quot;just not good enough&quot; for what should be the flagship programmes of SABC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite poor ARs, advertisers are still encouraging clients to buy air time as an advertising spot around the news is regarded as &quot;prime''.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lindsay Smithers-FCB media director Tony Banahan says the ratings are &quot; terrible&quot; but the News on SABC is &quot;one of the few programmes that the top end of the market watches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The market you are trying to reach is often people with disposable income and they are news and current affairs addicts,&quot; he says, adding that the news is the best the SABC has to offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the old days it would have been in the region of 20 ARs and the ratings we are now getting for the news are not half as good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reasons for this are twofold: people are tired of being faced with bad news and badly presented news and the broadcast area of SABC 3 is limited, reaching a small target audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saatchi &amp; Saatchi group media director Julie Dunstan says to monitor the ARs of adults across all channels is &quot;not a true reflection&quot; of the penetration of adverts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fragmentation in the market and a drop in ARs was expected following the relaunch of the new national public broadcaster, she says. And advertising around news bulletins depends largely on which target market one was aiming to reach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With all the bulletins in vernacular languages, you can plan your target market carefully,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other comments by media directors on the ratings received by news among adults included: &quot;Appalling ratings but time will tell if it'll improve&quot;, &quot; Viewers may watch the news but it is mainly for the headlines as excerpts are far too long&quot; and &quot;The ratings will slowly improve as audiences become accustomed to the changes which have happened and still are happening at the SABC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two weeks ago (November 11 to 17), the ARs for the news on SABC 3 were about seven, the same as the ARs for local soapie Egoli on M- Net, which also rated between seven and 7,5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The highest ratings for that same week went to local comedy Going Up on SABC 1 on Wednesdays, reaching 14,6ARs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A close second was another locally produced comedy, Suburban Bliss on SABC 2 on Mondays, which topped 13,2 ARs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The top 10 SABC programmes for children highlighted some interesting factors. The news on SABC 1, which is mainly in Xhosa and Zulu on Tuesdays and Fridays respectively, had high ARs among children - higher than adult viewers in the same language group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Xhosa news had 15,3 children's ARs, while Zulu news had 14,2 ARs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suburban Bliss on SABC 2 (Mondays) and Touched by an Angel on SABC 3 (Tuesdays) were favourites among children, reaching 21,2 and 8,1 ARs respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even when studying the top 10 programmes of the English and Afrikaans- speaking adults, news only reached about eight ARs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, average viewing time was only two hours per week, whether they were English, Afrikaans or Nguni/Sotho-speaking audiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media directors argue that television programming is no longer compelling viewing and news bulletins are no exception.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It is understood that the South African Broadcasting Corporation's (SABC) board has decided behind closed doors that 5FM will no longer play music that is older than 10 years. A 5FM staffer who refused to be named for fear of reprisals says the station was informed that its music format will change in a bid to reach a younger target audience.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">A SABC representative denied that such a decision was made.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SSAW's confidence in the strength and solidity of the South African management team has meant it has not been necessary to bring in any foreigners. Among the new portfolio announcements for management are Sandra Fisher, appointed as deputy managing director of the Gauteng office; William Leach, as South Africa Group chief executive as well as retaining his managing director's position and Tso Modise as joint deputy chair of the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NATIONAL PARTY assistant secretary general Marthinus van Schalkwyk this week charged that SABC board chair Dr Ivy Matsepe- Cassaburi should &quot;break her silence about speculation from African National Congress ranks that she could be appointed as Free State premier&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Schalkwyk says it cannot be justified that the Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Broadcasting has recommended her for the position of chair of the new SABC board while she is being considered for premier.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Press Council of South Africa, established in 1992 in response to pressure from former president PW Botha, will finally be dissolved next year following much debate on the future of this adjudicator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will be replaced by an ombudsman and an appeal panel which should be up and running by March next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Press Council chairman Kobus van Rooyen says there are two main reasons for closing-up shop.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first is the historical circumstances under which the Press Council was formed: &quot;Pressure was brought to bear on the press to bring its house in order by the government of president Botha which placed the media under state supervision and that has tainted the council.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second reason is that it is timely to bring the Press Council in accordance with the Constitution which enshrines freedom of expression: &quot;It has become necessary to make a fresh start within the Bill of Rights and it is necessary to end the perception that since government pressure has led to its founding, that it is not entirely independent and objective.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Rooyen also argues that the current council structure is too all- inclusive, adding that a separation of powers is essential. &quot;The powers of adjudicating should be the sole power of the ombudsman and he or she should not get involved in debate concerning press freedom. The main objective should be to remain impartial and allow other structures to take up various fights in the media.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Press Council and its predecessor, the Media Council, turned out to be a model of independent adjudication and a &quot;shield and sword against government's attempts to gag the press&quot;, Van Rooyen said. Yet an ombudsman could do this and more, including assessing complaints from the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advertisements will be placed nationally and nominations will be accepted for an ombudsman and four appeal panel members. A chief justice, or respected professional from the legal fraternity, will be approached to oversee nominations and finally make an appointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The successful candidates will have to serve for a period of five years and will be paid a nominal fee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freedom of Expression executive director Jeanette Minnie welcomed the move.  &quot;Since the mid-Eighties the media has been reluctant to introduce its own voluntary watchdog body in the face of press restrictions and States of Emergencies. Now in a new climate of press freedom it is encouraging and timely to see the role players in media taking steps towards having a body to monitor activities in the industry.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THE South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) is paying 216 000 pounds annually - more than R1,7-million at the current exchange rate - for its broadcasting office in London, half of which has been standing empty for about two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This at a time when the SABC is dogged with controversy regarding the state of its coffers. It has appealed several times to the Minister of Post, Telecommunications and Broadcasting, Jay Naidoo, for funds from the state Budget in an effort to balance the corporation's books.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also at a time when radio current affairs programmes have been ordered to cut down on live reports from international correspondents in order to save money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An SABC official in the finance department confirmed this week that the London office was renovated about two years ago to make place for six more radio reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the reporters - who were meant to file for SABC radio in six indigenous languages - never arrived as the plan, dreamed up in Johannesburg, was squashed on the grounds that &quot;it would be too expensive''.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the change of mind came too late as desks and equipment for the six were already placed in the renovated premises and had to be paid for.  Furthermore, the SABC was paying extra rent for the reporters' accommodation in one of the prime sites in London, just off Oxford Street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently only TV reporter Conrad Burke and a lone cameraman are using the large offices, which used to be the haunt of former SABC television editor Cliff Saunders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burke said this week that his operation was &quot;mean and lean&quot; in contrast to the Saunders regime and referred questions about rent to the SABC head office in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SABC's media department denied this week that accommodation for radio staffers existed in London, and quoted SABC Radio News editor Barney Mthombothi as saying that there had never been a plan to send radio reporters to London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, a number of SABC and other journalists the Mail &amp; Guardian spoke to refuted this and have commented on how large and extravagant the premises in London are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burke said that the SABC was busy reviewing its resources and that the cost- effectiveness of the office would come under review. &quot;I don't think that these offices should be closed down, because once you have closed down an operation like this, it is very difficult to start it up again,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In the 1990s, most governments are almost prisoners of international opinion, even in medium-sized countries such as South Africa.  Economic policy is determined not only by realities, but by impressions that filter through a small community of commentators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those in responsible positions need to recognise that unless they take account of the credibility factor in their statements and actions, they may suffer the consequences. This does not mean they must accept orthodox policies, merely that they must have a strategy for maintaining credibility.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The labour market is a good example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are told South Africa suffers from &quot;labour market inflexibility&quot;, that investors are put off by the regulations and trade union power, and that it has &quot;the highest unemployment in the world&quot;. Although there is no evidence to support those claims (except for what all agree are woefully inadequate data), the images feed into financial brochures and shape perceptions of the country's policy. In turn, policymakers are pushed into contemplating reforms to gain credibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To counter the problem to some extent, a reforming democratic government can respond by generating up-to-date, legitimate information. Take employment.  Critics claim South Africa has &quot;jobless growth&quot; and &quot;ever- rising unemployment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only last week, a leading international financial newspaper stated that &quot; official unemployment is 33%&quot;. In fact, there have been no unemployment figures since October 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we show, the figure then was exaggerated by over-estimating the number of unemployed and under-estimating employment. Since then, there has been economic growth, and there is reason to believe employment has risen, much of it unrecorded, because of its informal character, the growth of out-sourcing, contract labour, and so on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet invalid claims of jobless growth are used to justify draconian proposals, including lower wages for low-paid (black) workers. Unemployment is serious, but it does not help anybody to exaggerate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar problems arise with the assertion that the labour market is inflexible. Our review concluded that there is no evidence to support this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than repeat the arguments, let me mention some examples. Some observers make much of industrial (bargaining) councils as a source of inflexibility and unemployment. However, not only are a dwindling minority of workers covered by them, but the number covered by &quot;extensions&quot; may be matched by the number covered by &quot;exemptions&quot;. The scope and application of council agreements are such that it is a system of flexibility, which may wither away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take clothing. There are seven main industrial council agreements, two others negotiated between employers and the South African Clothing and Textile Workers Union, and one wage determination, divided into four areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For any grade there are about 60 minimum wages differentiated by area, including traineeships. There are numerous &quot;exemptions&quot;, granted on an ad hoc basis. The minimum wage for a labourer varies from R285,50/week in the greater Cape Town area, covered by the Western Cape industrial council, to R163,00 under the Isithebe agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wage determinations set much lower wages for the same jobs, and different minima co- exist within small geographical areas. With little bureaucracies all over the country, the system is so flexible that one wonders whether it is worth having.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another example is the flexible arrangements that apply to industrial estates scattered across the country. The Temporary Removal of Restrictions on Economic Activities Act of 1986 ceased to have effect in March 1994. But as proclamations issued under the Act have not been withdrawn, they still apply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Firms operating in those areas are thus exempt from wage regulations and key sections of the Labour Relations Act, Wage Act, Basic Conditions of Employment Act, and Machinery and Occupational Safety Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although one can document the flexibility inherent in South Africa's labour market, an image of &quot;inflexibility&quot; is created by assertions and a too- literal reading of labour laws, leading us back to the issue of credibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Globally, as employment and payment systems become more flexible, labour forces are fragmented, whereby more people are detached from statutory regulations, welfare systems and institutions. Insecurity is rife, taxes and welfare contributions are avoided or evaded, and inequities are glaring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there is no dichotomy of &quot;insiders&quot; and &quot;outsiders&quot;, there are diverse patterns in which the core of full-time employed workers is a dwindling proportion of the total. As laws are modified to protect non- core groups, the statutory system is likely to become so complex that the capacity to implement it and to monitor its outcomes is eroded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics say regulations create a straitjacket, while workers feel they have inadequate protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statutory regulations must set broadly accepted parameters of decency. To complement those, there should be encouragement for what we call voice regulation - mechanisms for bargaining between representatives of all labour groups, in conditions conducive to security, flexibility and economic efficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Achieving a good balance between statutory and voice regulation is delicate.  That is why a negotiated incomes policy is needed, based on a national, regional and company level policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At national level, the much-used term &quot;social accord&quot; is unfortunate, conveying an impression that government, business and labour representatives will go into a huddle and emerge with a blueprint involving wages, prices, taxes, interest rates, and much else. This could at best be a credibility- raising experience that would dissolve in mutual recrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is needed is a step-by-step process in which representatives bargain over desirable trade-offs. The National Economic Development and Labour Council has been moving in that direction. International norms should be the guiding principle. For example, agreement might be reached on reducing the undeniably long workweeks in return for measures to lower labour costs and raise productivity. Similarly, there might be negotiations on fiscal measures to compensate regions and enterprises hit by economic restructuring, or on narrowing the income gap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many issues could be negotiated at national level through such progression bargaining (the opposite of United States-style concession bargaining).  Others would be better negotiated at regional or sub- regional level, which is why we hope regional employment and development councils will emerge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To succeed, there must be a programme of worker education and genuine effort to involve those on the margins of the business and worker communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In flexible labour markets, incentives to good practices have more prospect of success than sanctions against bad. Of course, laws should identify and penalise unacceptable practices. Yet encouraging the good would discourage the mediocre as well as the bad, and shame the perpetrators of both. And encouraging good practice is also in the spirit of the era.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Western Cape is relying on several &quot;mega-projects&quot; to help it cope with the expected national economic downturn and still maintain its growth edge over other provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of Economic Affairs Chris Nissen told a conference on regional economic prospects this week it was &quot;rather pleasant&quot; to be in a province with above-average growth. But it had to be aware of the &quot;harsh realities&quot; facing the country as a whole and the need to ensure sustainable growth.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wesgro economist Wolfgang Thomas said this meant that the Western Cape had to get to grips with the new environment characterised by government spending cuts, trade liberalisation and the need to restructure broad sectors of the economy to make them more competitive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Western Cape hoped to soften the inevitable pain this would inflict on the economy by launching several mega-projects to promote job creation and stimulate economic activity to offset the expected downswing in consumer demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Western Cape was still expected to beat national average growth of about 3% of gross domestic product this year by clocking up 3,6% to 4,2%, a slowdown was expected next year in line with the national average.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Nissen and Thomas warned against complacency about the ability of the Western Cape to beat national growth levels. Unexpected hiccups such as the recent floods on the south-eastern part of the province could, for example, prove to be a major setback.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mega-projects the Western Cape is banking on include the R6,8-billion Saldanha Steel project now under way, infrastructural projects in anticipation of the bid for the 2004 Olympic Games, extensions to Mossgas, the expansion of Cape Town's airport and harbour, the redevelopment of District Six, the multi-million rand Capricorn science park and a planned R500-million convention centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairman of Cape Town's economic development and property committee Hanief Tiseker said a site in Sea Point near the Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront had been identified as the best possible site for the centre. It would have to be financed through a joint venture with the private sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tourism has emerged as the big growth sector in the Western Cape but Tiseker warned that a great deal would have to be done to jack up the availability of accommodation and international flights at peak periods as well as service levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said there were plans to increase the number of hotels to 115 from 100 between now and 1998. The number of rooms would be increased by 41% to 9 202 from 6 520.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thomas said tangible development projects under way included the provision of housing and extensions to the V&amp;A Waterfront. Although several other mega- projects were &quot;being talked about ... one of the challenges facing us is that we must move more of those projects from the talking phase to the actual implementation phase&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said a major problem with measuring growth in the Western Cape was the lack of reliable, disaggregated data for the province.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It could be the most unlikely of marriages, both in terms of historical differences and future ambitions. Yet the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut (AHI) and the National Federated Chamber of Commerce (Nafcoc) have agreed to begin working towards a single body representing business in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Partnership Initiative, as the tentative union is termed, is set to unite the efforts of South Africa's largest black and Afrikaans chambers of business in an attempt to &quot;serve and promote the economic interests of their members and of South Africa&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The partnership is still at the honeymoon stage and like any newlyweds, they are extremely nervous at upsetting their new- found partners. Both chambers are reluctant to discuss specific success achieved so far. However, their members, they say, are already reaching out across the divide into successful joint partnerships.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea for the union was first mooted at a bosberaad (informal conference) earlier this year and the executive committees of both AHI and Nafcoc are hoping that by early next year a more formal arrangement can be finalised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At present they are happily engaged in joint meetings to outline the future of the union in a &quot;spirit of goodwill&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although an unlikely wedlock, considering the diverse backgrounds the two chambers represent, they perhaps have more to learn from each other than any other two groupings in the South African economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider the example of Gencor - which was used as a vehicle to empower the Afrikaans people of South Africa by so-called English business - and the recently concluded sales of Johnnic and JCI by Anglo American to various black consortiums, realised in the name of black empowerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union with Nafcoc, says AHI executive director Jacob de Villiers, was born almost naturally because of the urgent need to unleash the potential of the economy and the country's human resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We knew, when the AHI started up in 1942, that we needed to help our members to gain access to information, capital and technology so that the Afrikaans community could become integrated into the business environment,&quot; De Villiers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A situation that is currently faced by Nafcoc's members and black business in general. By reaching out towards Nafcoc, De Villiers hopes that through the Partnership Initiative, AHI can impart some of its knowledge to Nafcoc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We knew that by reaching out to them and by helping them forward we would be helping the country forward,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a strong need at present to help black business gain a measure of access to those resources, which they have been previously denied, says De Villiers, if we plan to develop a successful economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The inequalities of the past placed a heavy burden on society, the economy and the individual. Black empowerment involves the need to do what is necessary to bring them into the economy as equal partners,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Villiers said AHI's strong membership and their integration into the formal business environment, along with the chamber's well developed sakekamers (business chambers), can contribute to the success of the venture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nafcoc executive director Phillip Machaba said at the initial meetings there were obvious apprehensions from both sides about the union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Barring the divergent backgrounds and objectives we might have had, there was a feeling that there is a need to concentrate on the areas of commonality that we both hold and move towards a sounder South African business environment,&quot; Machaba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of those areas of &quot;commonality&quot; is to promote economic empowerment and entrepreneurial development at all levels and the sharing of mutual resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The level of Nafcoc members' businesses is not at the same level of AHI; we hope through this exercise there can be a transfer of skills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is one of the many benefits that Nafcoc is hoping to gain from the Partnership Initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The members of both AHI and Nafcoc have taken on board the new partnership with vigour, according to Machaba. Already he has received indications that members have begun making tentative contact with AHI members, though they are treating the initiative with a measure of caution until it has been more formally developed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal, hope the two groups, will allow them to develop new capacity for both their members and their organisations. Future plans are to share resources for mutual benefit and develop joint policy and lobby for those policies together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they are not yet at the stage where either AHI or Nafcoc is willing to give up its respective individuality. On certain issues, such as land expropriation, there is bound to be an agreement to disagree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will not sacrifice or compromise our position just for the sake of coming together,&quot; Machaba said. But this, he felt, will facilitate debate between the two organisations, although he stresses that it is not a panacea for the ills of the past - rather a move towards addressing those issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sceptics have raised concerns about the AHI/Nafcoc Partnership Initiative.  They doubt whether the two chambers have any hope of an effective merger and question the need for a union.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Gross domestic product (GDP) figures for the third quarter were in line with expectations at an annualised rate of 3,2% growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This relative decline, after the unexpectedly strong growth in the second quarter of 3,5%, was only to be expected, says Bernie de Jager, head of the Reserve Bank's economics unit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Growth in the second quarter was particularly strong as consumers brought forward their purchases in anticipation of rising prices as the currency tumbled, so we expected a softening in the third quarter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But such spending gave rise to artificial growth, which is no longer sustainable with the latest increase in the cost of credit, and lower expectations of income growth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agriculture is up on the last quarter, thanks to a bumper crop of maize, most of which is harvested between June and September. An increase of 54,6% annualised growth was registered, compared with 41,2% last time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cause of the decline was manufacturing output, down 0,5% on the last quarter as consumers tightened their belts, and mining which fell 7%, in line with the general decline in gold output this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not all doom and gloom, however. De Jager says we needed a slowdown to prevent inflation spiralling out of control. The latest evidence of a rise in consumer prices had to be checked, he says, before we're back to the bad old days of double digits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With most economists factoring in the third quarter decline, overall growth is still on track for 3% this year, but is seen as slowing dramatically to between 2% and 2,5% next.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Analysts believe Mzi Khumalo's Capital Alliance-led African Mining Group has paid a premium for Anglo American's mining house, JCI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal, announced this week with Anglo's interim results, saw the consortium purchase a 34,9% stake in the mining house for R2,8- billion at R54,50 per share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One analyst said the fundamentals showed that JCI was substantially inflated at R50 per share.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consortium, which includes Co-ordinated Network Investments, African Renaissance and the Women's Development Bank, managed to clinch the deal from under the nose of Cyril Ramaphosa's New African Investments Limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in the Johnnic deal, Anglo will continue to retain an interest, holding some 12% of JCI. The African Mining Group consortium has, according to Anglo, the right of first refusal on its remaining stake if it decides to sell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's premier mining house has a market capitalisation of R7,5- billion and a controlling interest in South Africa's top gold mine Western Areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capital Alliance is a relative newcomer to the financial market, but since Khumalo assumed the mantle as executive chairman he has managed to pull off several coups for the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many analysts first started to sit up and take notice when it secured the services of former deputy managing director of Standard Corporate Merchant Bank, Mark Barns, last month as group chief executive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also managed to pull on board Arnold Shapiro, formerly senior portfolio manager at Old Mutual. His ability to bring these two heavyweights from the financial sector into the company's fold is viewed as an endorsement of the respect with which Capital Alliance is now held in the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capital Alliance Holdings has in the last six months been on a major acquisition drive, which saw the group acquire the entire issued share capital of Capital Alliance Bank (formerly NDH Bank), Capital Alliance Securities (formerly Ryan Anderson) and Capital Alliance Limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khumalo, a former Umkhonto weSizwe cadre, who spent 12 years on Robben Island, formed his own management consulting company, MK &amp; Associates in Durban in 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1994, in conjunction with McCarthy Retail and Rand Merchant Bank, Khumalo formed Capital Alliance. Latest results for the six months to September showed taxable income attributable to ordinary shareholders reached R25-million, with earnings per share rising to 35,2 cents from 26 cents.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - South African businesses have the highest expectation of fraud in the world, according to a new survey by the international consultancy, KPMG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the second survey of its kind to be conducted in this country, KPMG found that 66% of respondents had experienced some kind of fraud in the past year, 88% believed incidents of fraud to be on the increase, and 62% saw it as one of the biggest problems in business today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reasons given for this increase in white-collar crime were a weakening of social values (75%), economic pressures (70%) and inefficiencies in the justice system (66%). Other explanations included lack of government intervention, not enough emphasis on prevention and detection, more sophisticated criminals and insufficient penalties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But of the 1 000 businesses targeted in the survey, only 129 replied. Says Petrus Marais of KPMG's investigative unit: &quot;Many big corporations see fraud as an internal matter; there is a natural reluctance to broadcast such problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In addition, no one single person handles such issues in the large companies, so it takes a lot of work on their part to co- ordinate all the information needed to accurately respond to our questionnaire,&quot; says Marais.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, reported fraud cost more than R186,6-million in the past year - although many respondents believed this to be a conservative and unreliable measure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">External fraud, defined as product theft, false representations, extortion/blackmail, bribes, false invoices and credit-card misuse - the biggest culprit, with 1 400 instances - accounted for the majority of fraud cases (57%), while incurring 25,1% of the total financial loss reported in the survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Employee fraud cost companies the most (70,8%), while clocking up 39,9% of occurrences, with inventory theft top of the list (380 cases).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Management fraud was fairly innocuous by comparison, coming in at 3,1% of occurrences and 4,1% of cost. False financial statements, abuse of expense accounts and unnecessary purchases were the top offences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interestingly, although a high percentage of respondents claimed to be aware of the risks of fraud, 14% of cases were discovered only by accident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Internal controls caught up with 40% of offenders, while 28% were down to a targeted investigation by management; 22% owing to notification by another employee, and 19% owing to customers blowing the whistle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KPMG says most companies had already established anti-fraud measures but felt more initiatives were necessary to counter the growing problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Louw, chairman of the investigative accounting division, recommends the teamwork approach, involving external auditors in conjunction with management and internal auditors through audit committees, as well as risk- management processes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A starting point in the fight against financial crime is double-checking on new employees, following a corporate code of conduct and tightening internal controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most surprising aspects of this year's survey, says Marais, is just how many respondents (about 60%) reported incidents to the police, despite a widespread lack of confidence in the judicial system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This could be because the police are now prepared to register complaints without an affidavit being lodged, and because the King Commission's report on corporate governance has heightened awareness among company directors of good practice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the small size of the sample in the first survey conducted in 1994, comparisons would be invalid, says Marais, but KPMG hopes the next survey will trawl an even greater number of South Africa's biggest companies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - South Africans in India seem to be rather unpopular with their countrymen at present, which seems unusual. The rigours of a tour to India usually unite a nation in sympathy at the distress suffered by their loved sporting heroes! Even the English, great laughers at themselves, have chuckled at the loose bowels and general sufferings of their cricketers, rather than criticise them for their grumblings and complaints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What South Africans seem to be forgetting is that Indians are so used to the same complaints that they would be lost without them! Only very rarely is offence taken, and even then it does not last long. So long as the nation is accused of over-hospitality and not lack of it, then anything can be tolerated. True, the cricket-lovers are terribly enthusiastic and are invariably over-powering, but this is better than apathy, yes?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concept of personal privacy is a rare one in India. It simply does not exist for the majority of the population, and is therefore not a consideration when approaching the immensely popular South African team for an autograph or a handshake. No matter how inappropriate the moment!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from privacy, the biggest trouble spots appear to be cuisine, toilets, travel and practice facilities. Let it be repeated immediately, none of these difficulties are new. And as with any argument there are many factors to both sides of the argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indian food is heavily oil-based which, according to the South African fitness trainer Paddy Upton (who doubles as dietary expert), is as useful as steriods are to an athlete prior to a drugs test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apart from the fat implications,&quot; explains Upton, &quot;unclean oil is 10 times more likely to cause stomach upsets and diarrhoea than dirty water. The other problem is with chilli, curry and heavy garlic. Only four members of our party - Daryll Cullinan, Allan Donald, Bob Woolmer and myself - can actually eat spicy food without suffering afterwards. Despite asking every chef in every hotel and every ground to cook without oils, butter, chilli and garlic, we often get all four.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The explanation, as Upton concedes, is that his &quot;no-go&quot; ingredients are considered to be the essence of a good meal! The other problem, in the smaller centres, is the lack of experience in preparing Western &quot;tomato- based pasta dishes&quot; and &quot;grilled chicken&quot; that appear to be the basis of Upton's requests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two arguments spring to mind. Why don't the South Africans make an attempt to &quot;do as the Romans do&quot; when in Rome? The second, far more relevant point, is why on earth can't Indians be prepared (logistically, not spiritually) to supply a simple meal that would apparently satisfy the culinary demands of everyone from New Zealanders to Zimbabweans to Englishmen? The answer is simply one of organisation. Preparation has never been a popular Indian degree subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subject of travel itineraries is trickier and, possibly, murkier. While the South African press contingent have enjoyed at least three superior hotels throughout the tour, and have frequently endured more social flying hours than the players, the team are told that they are being given &quot;priority treatment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to one Indian Airlines official, they are being booked on the &quot; first available flight every day that they travel&quot;. While this may sound undeniably preferential, the reality is that the team have now reached double figures in pre- 6:00am wake-up calls in order to make an inevitably arduous trip to the airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The press, meanwhile, have risen several hours later and enjoyed a late breakfast before joining the team for their afternoon net session. Part of the problem is the necessity to use Indian Airlines (the official carrier) rather than the private airline that has couriered the press. But the reality is that someone within the corridors of power knew how tiring the &quot;priority&quot; schedule would be. No doubt the same thing occurs elsewhere in the world ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poor toilet facilities, despite sounding the least important complaint, are actually inexcusable. At five of the last seven venues I have been unable (or unwilling, perhaps) to use the public facilities. Being well dressed and able to communicate with the right people, I have discovered the private toilets of administrative officers and association presidents whenever needed. They have been clean, dry, flushing and even stocked with tissue paper. The toilet facilities within the teams' changing rooms have often been none of these things. Paddling into puddles and then pouring buckets of water down toilets to flush them may sound vaguely amusing to the casual reader, but competitive spirits can be more challenged by such things than even defeat itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no excuse. Money is plentiful within the game, but too seldom is it channeled fairly and correctly. A decent place to relax for 10 minutes with the morning newspaper should be every sportsman's right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the lack of net facilities has angered coach Bob Woolmer more than anything else. Throughout the tour he has complained of inadequate training facilities, but his words went unheeded because of the team's success. Now, when they lose, he says that he has been pilloried for &quot;sour grapes&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I see 60 000 capacity stadiums almost everywhere we go,&quot; says Woolmer, &quot; but when I ask - three days in advance - for three nets to practice in, we are given two pieces of old fishing net with holes in it. We are then told that there is no money for nets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woolmer finds this difficult to believe. But he is only half right. There is more than enough money to buy several thousand nets, but the men in charge of fiscal operations do not regard nets as their priority. The men that tell Woolmer there is no money, therefore, are telling the truth. They accept Woolmer's wrath as calmly and as placidly as they have accepted every other coach's indignation. The Indian team use the same nets, it must be said, but then their preparation habits are generally 10 years out of date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'My biggest fear,&quot; says Woolmer, &quot;is that the team will return to South Africa for another six Tests completely out of form! They haven't been able to keep themselves in touch.&quot; Incidentally, Woolmer's complete disregard for the issue of sour grapes makes it very likely that he is not suffering from the indigestion of defeat at all. &quot;I have said nothing different now to what I've said all along.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyway,&quot; he adds with a smile, &quot;I should bloody well hope I'm suffering from sour grapes. I hate losing!!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the South African team face the most difficult challenge on their still- young reborn international career, pehaps their difficulties can be placed in one last perspective. India's most famously recognised possession is its poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon this background are frequently painted the out-of-context complaints of &quot;spoilt&quot; Westerners. For tourists there is no excuse; come to India and you'd better &quot;do as the Indians do&quot;, and shut up if you don't like it. But for professional workers, trying to perform at their best in an alien environment in which they did not choose to be, conditions should be better.  You see, poverty can be a powerful camouflage and Indians do sometimes hide.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Shooting Stars of Nigeria and Zamalek of Egypt, the clubs who will contest the biggest club event on the African soccer calendar, need little introduction to South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stars, who host the first leg on Saturday before travelling to Cairo for the return match two weeks later, eliminated African Champions Cup title holders Orlando Pirates in the quarter-finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high-profile clash produced two intense matches with the Buccaneers winning 1-0 in Bloemfontein through an early penalty kick converted by midfielder Dumisa Ngobe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a similar score in the return match, this time favouring the Nigerians, and with the teams level on aggregate the tie was decided by a penalty shootout which Stars won 4-3.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zamalek have made two excursions to the home of South African soccer at FNB Stadium with Kaizer Chiefs defeating them 2-1 in the first leg of a 1993 Champions Cup tie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Amakhosi lost the return match 1-0 to fall under the away-goal rule and Zamalek went on to win the trophy a record-equalling third time by defeating famous Ghanaian club Asante Kotoko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This triumph qualified Zamalek for the African Super Cup, an annual showdown between the Champions Cup and Cup-winners Cup holders, and the Egyptians flew to the other end of the continent to confront compatriots Al- Ahly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zamalek triumphed 1-0 in a dull, defensive match which attracted 20 000 to Soccer City on a grey, wet afternoon. Sense has since prevailed regarding the venue with the champion club staging the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any contest between skilful, inspirational West Africans and disciplined, technically gifted North Africans carries enormous potential and this match could produce one of the greatest finals in the 32-year history of the cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clubs also met in the 1984 decider with Zamalek winning 2-0 in Cairo and 1-0 in Lagos against a Stars side that included Rashidi Yekini, who went on to become one of the best forwards on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That three-goal victory margin is unlikely to be repeated as Stars appear capable of providing much stiffer opposition this time, especially in the first leg at the 50 000- capacity Liberty Stadium in Ibadan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stars have lost only once there, a shock 2-1 defeat by Zimbabwe visitors Dynamos 15 years ago in a match this writer was privileged to attend as a member of the Harare delegation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dynamos returned there this year with considerable less luck, crumbling 5-1 to the rampant Nigerians, who had struck four past Gabonese club Mangasport in the previous round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goal supply dried up somewhat after that with just one against Pirates and two against JS Kabylie from Algeria in the semi- finals. Little known Kalu Umar is the leading individual scorer with five of the 14 goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zamalek are more renowned for defensive qualities than attacking prowess and they found the going even tougher in the semi- finals, scoring just once in two outings against the Tunisians from CS Sfaxien.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunrise of Mauritius were surprisingly stubborn first-round opponents and after receiving a bye when cash-strapped Mozambicans Desportivo withdrew, they comfortably disposed of inexperienced Moroccans Meknes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Egyptians would obviously love to win in Nigeria, a draw would leave them well placed ahead of the second leg at the 120 000-seat Nasser Stadium in the heart of Cairo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stars must know that a one-goal advantage would do little for the blood pressure of their squad, a two-goal lead would permit them to sleep peacefully, and a three-goal victory would virtually end the final as a contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But whoever lifts the trophy with no name, the record books will have to be updated because if Stars triumph they will be the first champions from Nigeria, and the first club to lift the three African Football Confederation trophies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should Zamalek emerge victorious they will jump above Canon Yaounde of Cameroon and Hafia of Guinea in the Champions Cup honours list with four titles and claim they are the greatest club in African history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the champions are seeking glory in south-western Nigeria, the curtain comes down on the CAF Cup in Morocco, where Kawkab Marrakech host Tunisian outfit Etoile du Sahel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This competition for national championship runners-up may be only four years old, but it often produces stronger line-ups and more exciting finals than the older, more prestigious Cup-winners Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Etoile, whose team contains several of the Tunisian team beaten by Bafana Bafana in the 1996 African Nations Cup final, conceded an early goal in the first leg only to bounce back and win 3-1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victims of Marrakech include Stade Tamponnaise, the team from Reunion that upset Sundowns in the second round, and the Moroccans have averaged 2.3 goals per home match in previous rounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the first all-North African final of a cup named after jailed Nigerian political Moshood Abiola and initially dominated by Nigerian clubs, and Etoile are attempting to become the first side to successfully defend the title.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was this overwhelming sense of dual purpose which ultimately persuaded Weah to don his boots in the United States, albeit against his principles.  They had turned their back on his stricken homeland, displaying apathy towards an ailing nation which he couldn't understand or accept.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Weah's head ruled his heart: &quot;With all the problems we've got at home, I have always got to remember to go out on the field and do my best whenever I can, so that people will say, 'George Weah, Liberia'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His movement on the football field speaks eloquently for African footballers, his voice away from the pitch pleads the cause of his war- ravaged country. &quot;I am not a politician,&quot; he says, &quot;I just have strong feelings for my country I cannot hide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weah's dedication to promoting his devastated country extends beyond preaching and playing. He is benefactor, as well as captain, of Liberia's national team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He dips into his own pocket to provide kit for the squad, air fares for exiled players, and match-winning bonuses to inspire his colleagues - as if playing alongside the most popular man in Liberia isn't incentive enough.  (After all, not many 30-year-olds have a set of postage stamps released in their honour.) When his country appeared in its first African Nations Cup, a proud Weah was in tears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He estimates he has spent 20% of his earnings in European football on his family and friends, and monthly phone bills home cost several thousand rands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Weah, personal wealth is not as important as spiritual health. When Ars.  ..ne Wenger brought the 22-year-old powerhouse of potential from Cameroon's Tonerre Yaounde to Monaco in 1988, Weah stuggled to balance enthusiasm for his personal break with fears about the broken land he was distanced from. &quot;I didn't know whether my parents were alive or dead,&quot; he recalls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His mother went to Ghana as part of an exodus of refugees and was looked after by the family of Abedi Pele, playing down the road at Marseille. Wenger had brought another three Liberians to France to help Weah to settle and the four friends would stay up at night listening to the BBC World Service for the precious little information which seeped through the news blackout. &quot;It destroyed them all,&quot; remembers Wenger. &quot;George didn't play well that year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Painting out a career against such a distressing backdrop, moving forward while retaining your roots, took tremendous mental strength. Wenger speaks warmly of his prot_g_: &quot;He was really determined to be successful and had a strong belief in his quality. But at the beginning nobody thought he could be somebody because he was a bit clumsy and slow.&quot; Every week Weah would tell his manager he wanted to play, and every week the reply was that he had to wait and to work on his development. He was raw, and Wenger laughs at the memory of his debut: &quot;A disaster, he was absolutely useless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some months later he had a run in the team which, in Wenger's eyes, established him as the best player in the world at that time. His form owed much to an instant rapport on the pitch with Glenn Hoddle. &quot;We played with only defenders plus Hoddle and Weah and we scored four goals every time,&quot; recalls the man now picking the team at Arsenal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wenger plays down repetitive speculation that Weah might join his new team, perhaps in the summer when Ajax's brilliant young striker Patrick Kluivert is expected to move to Milan. Perhaps even sooner if the powers that be at the San Siro take a dim view of his alleged butt last week which left Porto's Jorge Costa with a broken nose. It will be surprising if the Italian champions allow such an important player to leave, especially as it took them long enough to find a man capable of filling Marco van Basten's boots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the opening day of this season's Serie A scudetto, Weah reaffirmed his position as Milan's supreme striker with one of the finest individual goals ever seen. Weah carried the ball from one goalmouth to the other, bypassing eight Verona opponents, in 14 seconds. It wasn't only Italian observers who were hysterical in their praise. Weah celebrated in typically modest fashion by enjoying a quiet dinner with team-mate Edgar Davids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Away from football he is unassuming and unaffected by the trappings of stardom. When he was crowned Fifa World Footballer of the Year in January, he invited his mentor Wenger on to the stage and gave him the award. &quot;That was a symbol of his generosity,&quot; says the Frenchman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weah only wishes other international figures could join in the spirit of giving he finds so natural, notably Bill Clinton. America, having created Liberia in 1847, is a nation powerful enough to quell its increasing capacity to self-destruct through brutal civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every Liberian looks up to the United States,&quot; says Weah. &quot;What have we got to show for it? Nothing. If I could speak to Bill Clinton, I'd tell him that America has just not been fair to the Liberian people. To make us believe in democracy and human rights, the United Nations should go in and take over. The alternative is just letting us die as a people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like a modern-day Muhammad Ali, Weah is as motivated by injustice as sport.  The reigning African Footballer of the Year also devotes time to Unicef programmes, and returns to his roots as often as possible. A footballer last sold for $10-million can be seen in the streets of Monrovia, surrounded by swarms of Liberians, wearing jeans and a Bob Marley T-shirt. He knows he is an inspiration simply by going there. But that isn't enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the killing continues - it is suggested over 200 000 people have died during seven years of fighting - and hunger and poverty still afflicts his compatriots, &quot;George Weah, Liberia&quot; will persevere on the field, with football, and freedom, in mind.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - History is overwhelmingly on South Africa's side for the first Test against France in Bordeaux on Saturday, but the weather isn't. It was always going to be a shock to the system moving from the southern hemisphere humidity of Buenos Aires to a northern hemisphere winter, but as with the standard of the opposition, it's one thing to anticipate adversity, another to cope with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snow flakes were dancing when the squad arrived in Paris on Monday, and on Tuesday night in Lyons the heavens opened in almost African fashion.  Unfortunately the rain was not accompanied by Africa's largely temperate climate. But the Boks won 36-20 and Wayne Fyvie's dirt trackers went some way to expunging the memory of a disjointed performance against the French Barbarians in Brive.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But both games revealed the problem of coming to terms with an unfamiliar leather ball and the numbing effects of the weather on handling ability. The Boks constantly lost the ball going forward because it was a) more slippery than they were used to and b) colder than they were used to. If the Test side make the same errors on Saturday the tour could lurch into crisis with a first Test defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there are solid reasons to believe that South Africa will start favourites against the Tricolors. To deal with history first, the overall record between the sides is 14 wins for the Boks against five for the French, with a remarkable five draws. France have won only once on home soil, that being the last time the teams met in Paris in October 1992. Otherwise South Africa have won seven out of eight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bordeaux is another famous link to past encounters. In 1913 South Africa won 38-5 in the wine capital to record their highest points difference against the Tricolors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another interesting parallel is the two-Test tour, which in 1992 under Naas Botha was shared 1-1. Botha himself was the catalyst for an against-the-odds first Test win in Lyons, kicking his side to a 28-15 victory before the French got spectacular revenge with a 29-16 win in Paris a week later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The way things are going at the moment Andre Markgraaff would give his eye teeth for a kicker of Botha's ability, even if it would totally disrupt the pattern he has painstakingly put together on this tour. Markgraaff has said publicly that he intends his team to win Tests by scoring tries, but on foreign soil, in extremely foreign conditions it would seem like carelessness if the Boks could not fall back on place kicking to win in extremis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the Test, in addition to history, the Boks have a few playing matters on their side as well. Firstly Markgraaff must be hugging himself with glee over being able to select the same team for three Tests in a row. By contrast Jean-Claude Skrela has had to mix and match his team due to injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Markgraaff has been very careful not to gloat and has spent some time talking up the abilities of the new players, but even a country as filled with backline talent as France must struggle to replace a great pair of wings like Phillipe Saint-Andr_ and Emile N'tamack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Markgraaff said in the week that the game is won and lost before it reaches the wings, but these two are living proof of the limited truth contained in that opinion. In 1994 it was Saint-Andr_ who, in the dying moments of the 1994 Test against the All Blacks in Auckland sparked the so-called &quot;try from the end of the earth&quot; which seized victory and a series win in New Zealand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for N'tamack, it was his try in the dying minutes of the World Cup match in Pretoria which beat Scotland 22-19 and allowed France to avoid the All Blacks in the quarter- finals. N'tamack and Saint-Andr_ will be replaced by Richard Dourthe, a converted centre, and David Berty, the Toulouse player who is known in France for his inability to translate club form to Test form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other problem for the French is at lock where the great Olivier Roumat and the rumbustious Olivier Merle are unfit and replaced by Fabien Pelous and Hugues Miorin. The prodigious form of Mark Andrews and Kobus Wiese would suggest an edge for the tourists both in the scrums and lineouts and, perhaps crucially, in the rucks and mauls from which Markgraaff wishes to build his game plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Barbarians were very successful in preventing the Boks from getting quick ball from these breakdown situations, not least because the referee allowed them to live offside and come over the top. The Boks must hope for a better application of the laws on Saturday, although they should be able to gain confidence by looking back on the Puma Tests where Gary Teichmann did not allow spoiling tactics to affect his outlook on how to win the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is natural for South Africans to be pessimistic about their ability to beat good teams like France, doubly so in tour, but there is enough character in this Springbok team to overcome whatever odds they might mentally have stacked against themselves. Expect a frustrating, but ultimately successful campaign to trample out the vintage in Bordeaux.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - After two years in regression, Sunday's Soweto Marathon aims to recapture some of the lustre that led many to believe it would become the &quot; Comrades&quot; or &quot;Two Oceans&quot; of the standard marathon distance when it was launched in a blaze of hype in 1993. Towards this end Sunday's race boasts the added attraction of hosting the African Marathon Championships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although a marathon was first staged in Soweto in 1991 when 700 finished the Coca- Cola Sowetan Marathon, the present Soweto Marathon, on the first Sunday of December, was only born in 1993 under a three-year sponsorship deal with M-Net. Taking place in the general euphoria leading up to the 1994 elections and billed as a &quot;Run for Peace&quot;, that race attracted a field of 3 200 and the people of Soweto came out in their thousands to create a carnival atmosphere. But a fall- out with M-Net, and changes of sponsors over the past two years saw a waning interest on the part of athletes and spectators alike.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the good of athletics it is important to arrest this trend. A successful, high- profile race of this nature in an area like Soweto can go a long way towards creating the athletics culture so necessary for the growth of the sport in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The novelty of running in Soweto has worn off for those umlungus who have aIready run the race and the general climate of violence in Gauteng could prevent others from undertaking the venture. Also, although it is the first qualifier for next year's Comrades, it comes too late for most athletes with their sights set on the Natal classic. However, Comrades runners form the largest constituency among local marathon runners and it is important to cater for their needs if the race wants to attract a big field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one of the toughest marathon courses around, Soweto will never be a venue for fast times or personal bests. That alone will be a deterrent for top international athletes, and with the rapidly weakening rand it will become increasingly difficult to entice the top runners when they can earn considerably more overseas. It will obviously take time to build the profile of the race but for that to happen the City of Johannesburg needs to perceive it as a cultural asset which is worth supporting and developing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for Sunday's race, the main interest will lie with the battle for the African Marathon Championships which is sadly for men only. The outcome of this race-within-a-race should also account for the victor of the Soweto Marathon unless there is a major surprise - which could perhaps come from seasoned distance star Meshack Mogotsi who is making his marathon debut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of South Africa's top marathoners - nor those from the rest of the continent for that matter - will be present but even so the four selected to wear the green and gold, with three to count, should comfortably win the team and individual prizes. Although Africa has many of the world's best over the 42.2km distance, glory for one's country is a poor substitute for financial gain, especially when a top marathon runner has only three or four good races in his legs to escape poverty and secure a comfortable future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed South Africa's biggest drawcard, Josiah Thugwane, will be lining up in Japan a few hours before the Soweto Marathon gets underway as he collects his first handsome payback at the Fukuoka Marathon after the Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nine countries indicated they would send full teams to the championships with five others confirming lesser numbers of athletes. However, even though entries closed on November 8, Athletics South Africa only began receiving names this week and the nine teams are now down to five with the outside chance of a late show by Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only Kenya - whose three unknown athletes have times of 2:14 or 2:15 which would he dangerous if run at altitude - could provide a threat. That leaves the odds favouring a repeat of South Africa's wins from the inaugural championships in Abidjan two years ago when Andries Pilusa's victory also led his team home first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fastest man in the field is 1995 South African champion Martin Ndivheni, but he may still be feeling the effects of September's Berlin Marathon where he finished fifth in an excellent time of 2:10:21. Also in the South African team is Adam Motlagale who finished one place ahead of Ndivheni to take third at this year's national championships in Cape Town. The other two team members, Simon Mphulanyane and Desmond Witbooi, have yet to break 2:15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year's defending women's champion, Jowaine Parrot, is absent on Sunday and the favourite is ultra specialist Helene Joubert who will be going for a hat-trick of victories after winning the race in 1993 and 1994.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - OPEN SPACE: SIX CONTEMPORARY PLAYS FROM AFRICA edited and with an introduction by Yvette Hutchinson and Kole Omotoso (Kagiso, R42,95)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MY LIFE AND VALLEY SONG by Athol Fugard (Hodder &amp; Stoughton/ Witwatersrand University Press R25,95)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRAITOR ON THE ICE by John Kench (Mallard, R35)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT requires a certain commitment and patience to obtain and read plays, so it would seem to be a small miracle that local publishers continue, year after year, to offer drama to an ever-slackening reading public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three books of plays, published this year, are examples of what is considered by publishers' editors as worthwhile material in this domain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Open Space, edited by Yvette Hutchinson and Kole Omotoso, claims to not offer a defence of particular cultural practices but rather to explain how it is that African drama came to be what it is. The introduction situates its content, in the routines of African daily life where rituals are still valid and are still believed in.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intended reader - the drama student - is offered a method of analysing and contextualising plays with consideration to structure, plot and the playwright's point of view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The selected texts help build an understanding of African drama. There are explorations of colonialism from different corners of the continent in Reza de Wet's A Worm in the Bud and Ferdinand Oyono's Houseboy, while economic problems in contemporary Africa are investigated in Zakes Mda's The Hill and Tewfik Al-Hakim's The Donkey Market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exotic ritual, political satire and questions of gender are also features of the six plays of Open Space. Each is individually introduced to offer the student a well-rounded insight into the commonality of a drama that has retained an African identity despite exposure to European forms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Athol Fugard, on the other hand, has recently taken off on a road of his own. Concentrating his efforts on a variety of youthful experiences - particularly those of young women - he has begun a cycle of plays that evoke the type of workshopped drama undertaken by groups of actors in the late Seventies and early Eighties, a style of which Fugard was an important forebear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his plays My Life and Valley Song, Fugard claims to enter into a dialogue with his girls, employing no fixed agenda, using diaries in which the youngsters express their hopes, dreams, fears and nightmares. The result is two plays (which were staged) that are charming, naive and sincere. What can be gleaned is that the young women's transitions from girlhood to adulthood are used as a metaphor for South Africa's democratic coming of age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although it is doubtful whether theatre practitioners will use the text to restage these plays, the background notes to the productions, as well as the interview conducted by Witwatersrand University Press managing editor Pat Schwartz with Fugard, indicate a means of achieving a form of performance text, and a style that is accessible to all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fugard has definitely softened with age, and his seasoned system of achieving his ends stands as an example to educators of how to deal with the complexities of South African experience. But what both Open Space and My Life display is an underlying anxiety which peppers the creative expression of all those who dwell on our continent. Even Fugard's young women tell stories of conflict between the traditional and the contemporary, and one senses a deep-seated fear of patriarchy in traditional family environments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, John Kench's Traitor on the Ice is an unperformed text. Set in the Arctic circle, it concerns three Russian explorers who are on an expedition to test the powers of the &quot;new Soviet man&quot; under extreme conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What follows is a somewhat satirical play - based on the real-life adventures of the Soviet explorer Ivan Papanin - that is supposed to be a type of Three Stooges on ice. References are made to &quot;Comrade Stalin&quot; throughout, and it becomes obvious that Kench - known for his books on South African furniture and wines - has a big problem with archaic communism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moments of intended humour fail as the three characters bumble their way through the Arctic. Traitor on the Ice is a non-starter which will probably gather a lot of dust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The publishing of drama is a complex field, one often undertaken by publishers as an act of faith. It is interesting to note, then, how faithful publishers are to their playwrights, reproducing their new works, year after year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - God Bless Africa, a three-part documentary to be shown on SABC3 on December 19, 26 and January 2, is one of those rare, valuable TV animals - a locally made historical documentary. They've always been few and far between on our TV stations, but now that we perhaps have the time and the will to recover our history, we're faced with a new problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the exchange rate as bad as it is, film-makers simply cannot afford the expensive fees for visual material charged by international archives. And a lot of our history is stored in vaults in Europe, explained Lesley Lawson, the director and researcher. &quot;Work like this is getting harder and harder to do,&quot; she said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The series is the first ever history of the missionaries undertaken for TV and it grew out of Lawson's directorial and research work on the history of the ANC - Ulibamba Lingashoni: Hold Up the Sun - flighted in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">God Bless Africa opens with President Mandela's visit to Genadendal, the first mission station in the country, established in 1737. Mandela has acknowledged his debt to mission education by renaming his residence after this station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It then plunges straight into the ambiguities of mission activity, and raises the fact that missionaries often told local people their culture was evil. However, the irrepressible Bishop Tutu adds that freedom would not have come without the missionary message, &quot;because they also brought one of the most fantastic things, the gospel of Jesus Christ, and the Bible, which turned out to be one of the most revolutionary things available&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I knew the missions were important formative forces for many of the ANC leaders,&quot; says Lawson, &quot;but I also had in mind that they were the standard bearers of colonialism, the spiritual and ideological wing of the colonial forces. But none of the ANC people I interviewed would say that. I decided there was much more to the role of the missions than I had thought and I wanted to get to the bottom of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before there had either been church histories, which were thus hagiographies, or Marxist critiques, but there is now a new historical view of missions, looking at personal histories and values as much as social forces. It looks at individual missionaries and converts and who they were, in a much more complex way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also, it's clear that missionaries were the only film-makers who even saw black people and filmed black life from about the 1920s onwards. I realised there was a wealth of material in church archives. We didn't have enough money for everything we'd like but we did find rare footage in England and Germany. There is an American archive too, but we couldn't locate it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first part, Frontiers, we're taken through early history, with comments from contemporary church people. The second part, called Transformations, carries the story further and discusses the lives of early converts and how difficult it was, and is, to marry two cultures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, marriage was one of the big areas of conflict, with polygamy seen as a grievous sin by the church and leading to heartache and disruption when, for example, second and third wives were renounced. It also looks at the first black missionaries, like Tiyo Soga, ordained in 1856, and the role of mission education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third part, called Divisions, enters the 20th century and discusses the evolution of apartheid, especially within the Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk (NGK), which established separate churches in 1880.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was not only the Afrikaans church that had this philosophy. By the turn of the century, the indigenous clergy were the backbone of the mission church, but they were seldom regarded as equals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They responded by breaking away to form their own churches. The first, the Ethiopian church, was established in 1883, with Zionist churches soon following, led by figures like James Dwane and the prophet Isaiah Shembe, who established a village on 1 000ha of land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, the apartheid state launched an all- out assault on missions, putting an end to their educational efforts as well as driving off labour tenants in terms of the Group Areas Act. Bernard Spong, the last missionary sent out here by the London Missionary Society in the 1960s, describes the closing of Tigerkloof School as a result of the Bantu Education Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the face of these assaults, most stations decided to close. The apartheid state ruined lives and opportunities, not to mention totally destroying excellent resources. But some of them, including Tigerkloof, have since 1990 been reconstituted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawson interviewed few academics for the series, concentrating instead on people in the church. &quot;We decided to interview people for whom the history is part of everyday life, making it relevant to the here and now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was concerned as an outsider to make a film with an insider perspective and not to make a film that would offend church leaders. Indeed, the criticisms of the missions come from the church leaders themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Said Mfundi Vundla at the launch of the Independent Producer's Organisation (IPO), held at the Film and Video Market in Cape Town: &quot;We all know it, we've all heard it said so often: 'South Africa's got everything it takes - the stories, the skills, the locations' Yet our industry is producing fewer feature films than some neighbouring countries and our television industry is outperformed by countries half our size in other parts of the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some independent producers have decided to tackle the problems inhibiting film production - they met in June this year to discuss forming a joint body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then a national workshop was held in late October, after months of groundwork and consultations in Johannesburg and Cape Town. Over 100 independent producers attended and the idea of an organisation received unanimous support.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were some fairly big names on the list - Carl Fischer and Feizel Mamdoo of Endemol Productions (formerly Toron Productions), Mfundi Vundla (Soweto Green) and Eddie Mbalo (Flat 27) - so I wondered what exactly &quot; independent&quot; meant?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Mark Newman, a member of the steering committee and a successful documentary producer/director in his own right,&quot;We define an independent producer as someone who is not employed by or has a shareholding in a broadcaster. Also, people in government or involved in distribution are excluded from the category.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Newman, &quot;ordinary members&quot; would qualify on the basis of a proven production record, but the organisation will also embrace aspiring and emerging young talent with affiliate membership rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IPO used Britain's Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television (Pact) set-up as a role-model because its aims are pretty similar: to represent the specific needs and interests of producers; to promote the economic and cultural interests of the local film and TV industry; to develop growth strategies for the industry; to regulate contracts; and to lobby interested parties to create a more productive local film and TV culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Newman put it, &quot;We want to kick butt with government and broadcasters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On top of all this the IPO will offer basic benefits like information networking, legal and business clinics and services, a lobbying channel, industrial business regulation, business and production advantages, international relations, training and development opportunities and the like.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funded by membership dues, the body also hopes to institute a production levy on all films or television programmes made by members. This will involve 25% of the production budget for features and 5% for television productions (based on the UK model) - but the IPO still awaits the response of broadcasters and financiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numerous umbrella film organisations actively supported the new body. The Film and Allied Workers' organisation (Fawo), which has subsequently closed down, and the South African Film and Television Institute (Safti), lent active moral and even financial support. Other organisations, like the Black Filmmaker's Association, Women in Film and the National Television and Video Association, among many others, have all lent their support and committed themselves to a healthy collaborative relationship with the IPO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IPO member Feizel Mamdoo explains the dynamism of the alliance, &quot;The IPO is being born in a different situation to the past. Whereas then producers may have had ideological differences, in the post- democratic context people have recognised that we have to pull together. There's a definite sense of a step towards maturity from all the players.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newman laughs off the petty back-stabbing all too prevalent in the movie business, &quot;It's so obvious, the need for something like this, everyone's shaking hands because they all feel the sense that there's a vacuum in terms of where the industry should be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mamdoo said, in his address at the October workshop, &quot;Our industry has suffered racial and ideological divisions as a consequence of apartheid and has been distorted in access to training and opportunity, in decision-making and economic power and in artistic expression.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a reforming public broadcaster, an independent broadcasting authority and government actively developing policies for the film industry in terms of local content and international co-production treaties, it appears the time is ripe for the key independent film and TV producers to take a united stand - so that the individual producer can have a say in determining these policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Mamdoo explains, &quot;The vision of a producer's organisation goes beyond the mere establishment of some kind of democratically appointed committee. It goes beyond the idea of an organisation that is merely reactive in nature. It is instead envisaged as a dynamic and proactive organisation implementing positive programmes to advance the interests of producers and the industry as a whole.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the unwieldy PC feel of much of the jargon, the need has clearly been identified by everyone - from the &quot;big guys&quot; to the small &quot;fax machine and a dog&quot; operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's not all coming up roses. Newman expresses his exasperation at the limited vision of the public broadcasters - &quot;The SABC have called in some management consultants at a cost of R6-million to help downsize their operation. They're a monolithic conglomerate and no one there seems to have the common sense to develop feature films of any sort. It's run by administrators, not filmmakers like Channel Four or the BBC. This organisation is our last chance, if it doesn't lead to the local industry putting South African culture on the world map through film, then I give up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the moment though, there's no need for such despondency, the new organisation possesses all the skills, talent and, above all, zeal to help make some far-reaching changes to an industry all too bogged down by complacency, bad will and incompetence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Bellville's bureaucrats might not know about art, but they know they don't like Mark Coetzee's art. They won't allow his images of nude males in the gallery run by the Bellville branch of the South African Association of Arts (SAAA). And the SAAA, whose president Conrad Thys has voiced his opposition to censorship, has proven impotent in acting on it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The storm in a loincloth began after Coetzee won the Volkskas Atelier Award four years ago. This included a sojourn in Paris. On his return he was contractually obliged to exhibit in one of the 23 SAAA galleries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coetzee said Bellville was not his first choice but his preferred gallery had left the SAAA. He then approached Bellville, as it was close, asking branch administrator Johan Coetzee if the gallery needed to see his work first, as a courtesy, even though this is unprecedented for an Atelier winner.  The gallery assured him it was unnecessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But attitudes stiffened after Coetzee disclosed the contents of his work.  While the Bellville members probably have no problem admiring pictures of naked women, pictures of men in similar states of unadornment are a different ball game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The person whose ethical sensibilities were pricked most was town administrator Sakkie De Villiers. He declared the work &quot;should not be accessible to the public&quot;. The Association's Coetzee adopted a more pragmatic approach. He requested, without having seen the offending work, that certain images be omitted or restricted to an area reserved for &quot;dirty&quot; work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I refused,&quot; says Coetzee, &quot;because this would have been censorship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even SAAA president Conrad Thys appears to be bowing to Bellville's moral minority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thys said all SAAA branches were autonomous and Coetzee's is not exempt from selection. He rejects the artist's request not to exhibit at an SAAA gallery because this would also amount to bowing to censorship. Coetzee, he suggests, should submit his work to an independent selection panel set up by head office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Coetzee rejects the SAAA's flaccid response as &quot;hypocritical&quot; and plans to bring his battle of the bulges before a special hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What really bothers me is that these double standards restrict open debate.  And now my show hangs in the balance.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The King of Radio Zulu is dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cyril Bongani Mchunu, known to his loving fans as &quot;Kansas City&quot;, was the DJ King of Radio Zulu. He was also widely rumoured to be one of the kingpins of payola - an intricate network of bribery between record companies and broadcasters. And, as fans wept over his untimely death last week, the murkier aspects of his private life came to light.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mchunu died last Thursday at the Durban City Hospital at the age of 46. The official cause of death was tuberculosis - for which he had been hospitalised many times. But insiders from Radio Zulu say that according to gossip TB may not have been the sole cause of death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When he returned from the clinic in Kwamakhuthu, the station's management acted peculiarly. They seemed to want to keep his illness under wraps,&quot; recalls a former colleague. &quot;But even though he was obviously ill, nothing could keep those male hormones of his inactive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His former colleagues at Radio Zulu, now Ukhozi FM, and SABC's Ngomgqibelo/Kamokibelo, remember him as an extraordinarily charismatic personality and a real &quot;people's person&quot; who helped make Radio Zulu the most popular station in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it seems that Mchunu didn't simply court controversy over his health and legendary sexual appetite. Informed sources cite his undisguised relish for money as another weakness. &quot;He would do anything for it,&quot; they say, &quot;even accept bribes from recording companies to play certain records.&quot; In fact, Radio Zulu was widely perceived as a hotbed of payola and prior to his death, Mchunu in particular was under media scrutiny. Many believe that his lavish house, cars and lifestyle bore more than a coincidental relationship to payola payouts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mchunu embodied the best and worst of the African dream. Born to a poor rural family, he matriculated while working as a clerk. In 1972 he joined Radio Zulu, where his charisma and communication skills soon catapulted him into the position of programme compiler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 1975, Akulalwa, the &quot;party time programme&quot; was launched, transforming Mchunu into a radio icon. And his star shone even brighter with the Saturday Evening Top 20 and a phone-in show Zakhala Izingcingo on Sundays. His TV debut co-hosting Ngomgqibelo/Kamokibelo was no less successful. In 1990 he won an Artes for Best Presenter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while his career sailed along seamlessly, the pieces of his personal life were more jagged. And his marriage to the niece of his dead wife further dogged the man who was often teased about having &quot;the freedom of the city&quot;.  Recalls a close friend: &quot;He was an incredible guy. But he did what suited him - straddling a western lifestyle and reverting to tradition as the mood took him, spending like a maniac, screwing around, getting the record companies to dance to his tune. He believed he was invincible.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A United States company has offered to build a factory in Namibia if it receives a contract to supply pipe for a controversial project designed to drain water from the Okavango River, which feeds the Okavango Delta in northern Botswana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Namibian government, desperate to ease the pain of drought facing the country and Windhoek in particular, plans to take water from the river in a move that conservationists argue would put the delta at severe risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month two executives from Owens Corning, a company based in Ohio with strong South African interests, met senior figures in the Namibian government to express an interest in supplying pipe - made from fibreglass - to build the 250km final section of Namibia's Eastern National Water Carrier, which will divert water from a point on the Okavango River near Rundu in northern Namibia to Windhoek, several hundred kilometres away. The pipe will draw 700 litres of water a second from the river. The executives said that the pipe could be manufactured at a local, purpose-built plant.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Okavango is the third-largest river in Southern Africa. It flows from its birthplace in the Angolan highlands down through Namibia and into Botswana. There it hits the flat plains of the Kalahari and spreads out in a dazzling array of channels that make up the world's largest oasis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delta provides a home to a vast array of wildlife and the tourism it brings is Botswana's third-largest foreign currency earner. The residents of Maun, a town at the foot of the delta, are terrified that the pipeline will reduce the amount of water the delta receives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the moment, a lack of rain in the Angolan highlands has left the area drier than at any time in living memory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kehemetswe Saozo makes his living punting tourists through the delta's reed beds. &quot;If the water dries up it will be the end of our lives,&quot; he said, referring to Namibia's plan to pipe the water. &quot;All the things of our lives are solely dependent on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Namibians argue that the amount of water they want to take will be negligible and that, because of the drought, they have no choice. &quot;If we don't build the pipeline and the rains fail again ... To put it bluntly we'll be in the shit,&quot; said Piet Heyns, the senior Namibian water engineer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This view is not well accepted in Maun. &quot;They say the pipeline is the alternative,&quot; said Professor Lars Ramberg, director of the University of Botswana's Okavango Research Centre. &quot;Well, I'd like to see some other alternatives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year, for the first time, the annual flood that usually fills the delta did not reach Maun. The town's water, drawn from boreholes, is drying up. While engineers desperately try to work out how fast the water table is dropping, the area's white residents worry for their businesses. But at least they can always move elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not so for the black population. &quot;I don't like this pipeline very much,&quot; said Tawana Moremi, the delta's paramount chief. &quot;We should buy more planes and bomb it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although far-fetched - Botswana has no history of violence towards its neighbours - confrontation between Namibia and Botswana is an idea often raised. Botswana recently tried to buy tanks from Europe but the deal was scotched, most think by a plea from Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There has been the suggestion that the Batswana want to buy tanks to shoot at the Namibians because they want to steal water from the Okavango,&quot; said Heyns. &quot;That is nonsense, the two things are not connected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were told in June that Namibia had a serious drought problem,&quot; said Momemi Sekwale, leader of Botswana's delegation to Okacom, a commission set up by Namibia, Botswana and Angola to ensure prudent use of the river. If Sekwale is angry that Namibia has superseded Okacom, then he does not show it: &quot;The position of Botswana is that we cannot oppose a feasibility study, under the circumstances we can only ask to be kept informed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the question remains as to whether it is safe to interfere with the delta's one supply of water. The Okavango is robust enough to survive anything except the water being turned off. If that happens a Garden of Eden returns to Kalahari dust. -0-</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The struggle for the return to Ethiopia of the Aksum obelisk, looted by fascist Italy in 1937 and so far not returned, has passed through several different stages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The movement has witnessed: a petition by 500 prominent Ethiopians, among them a former Prime Minister, Lij Mikael Imru, and many leaders of culture; a petition by several thousand Addis Ababa University students; the founding in Addis Ababa of an Aksum Obelisk Return Committee; a demonstration in the Addis Ababa stadium, in which the vast crowd chanted, of the obelisk, &quot;Let it Return!, Let it Return!&quot;; innumerable messages of support by prominent scholars of Ethiopia and Italy (to cite but one example of each, Professor Sven Rubenson and Professor Denis Mack Smith); statements by prominent African diplomats and scholars (for example the ambassadors in Addis Ababa of Nigeria and Zimbabwe, and the Egyptian Antiquities Department); unanimous resolutions by the Ethiopian Federal Parliament and the Assembly of Region 1; a letter from the Ethiopian Patriarch, Abuna Pawlos V, to the Pope of Rome; a petition by 13,000 inhabitants of Aksum; the placing of a placard on the obelisk, stating that it belongs to Ethiopia, and must be returned forthwith; and, most recently, a voice of support from the Secretary-General of the Organisation of African Unity, Dr Salim Ahmed Salim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the most recent phase of the struggle scores of letters have been addressed to diplomats and prominent personalities throughout the world.  Several such letters are from Americans of Italian descent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One such letter was written to the United States ambassador in Rome, Reginald Bartholomew, on 1 July of this year, by Professor Pascal J. Imperato, an Italo-American, who holds the prestigious title of Distinguished Service Professor in the Department of Preventive Medicine and Community Health in the State University of New York. An Africanist of note, he writes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the Italian-Ethiopian war, the Italian government removed an obelisk from Aksum in Ethiopia. It presently stands in the Piazza di Porta Capena in Rome in front of the headquarters of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As an Africanist with a special interest in the Horn of Africa, and as an Italian-American, I am both puzzled and troubled as to why successive Italian governments have not returned this obelisk, despite repeated requests by the Ethiopian government. This is all the more difficult to comprehend since the Italian-United Nations peace treaty of 1947 calls for the return of Ethiopian patrimony looted during the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The obelisk's location in an area of dense vehicular traffic exposes it to significant pollution-induced erosion and damage. This alone strongly persuades in favor of its removal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Italy is a country where there is a very high level of consciousness about the importance and value to national identity of historic and religious treasures. Thus Italy's continued retention of a major historical monument looted from another country defies its own values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I should be grateful for whatever efforts you could undertake to resolve this long-standing issue&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another letter was despatched by Professor C. Gamst, an American anthropologist of partial Italian descent at the Department of Anthropology of the University of Massachusetts at Boston. On 24 October he wrote to Ferdinando Salleo, the Italian Ambassador to the United States, to say:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This letter requests your assistance in the return by the Italian government to Ethiopia of the great Aksumite obelisk, taken as Axis war booty from a prostrate Ethiopia, as discussed below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have heard that the Italian government, at long last, is considering its treaty responsibility to return the Great Obelisk of Aksum, stolen by the Fascists in 1937, from Ethiopia which they invaded and violated. This colossal theft is, of course, among the first war crimes of the various Fascist aggressors during World War II, a devastation with which they engulfed the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The grand monument of Aksum is a magisterial manifestation in architecture and art of the cultural heritage of the citizens of Ethiopia. The present Italian government, successor to that of the Fascists defeated by the United Nations in 1943, should speedily restore this looted monument to its original Aksumite location, and at no cost to the government and people of Ethiopia.  Such a return of its war loot by a post-Fascist government of Italy is now more than a half century overdue. I am sure that the current government of Italy will, at long last, desire to do the right thing as a legitimate member of the family of nations - immediately to restore the great Obelisk to Aksum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As an Italo-American on my mother's side (nee Aida Rosa Durante, daughter of Pasquale and Rosa Durante), I find the Italian war crimes against persons and property in Ethiopia unconscionable. I request your excellency's assistance in this matter of effecting justice, long denied, regarding the Great Obelisk of Aksum&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another American scholar of Italian descent, Professor Norma Comrada, of the University of Oregon, at Eugene, also wrote to the Italian Ambassador in Washington, on 13 September, as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am writing in regard to the Ethiopian obelisk which now resides in Rome.  My understanding is that the Italian government indeed intends to return the obelisk to Ethiopia, and that this will happen in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;May I add my voice to those who applaud this action? It would be both generous and appropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Thank you for whatever indication you may give to your government that the return of the obelisk is supported by many Americans, as well as Ethiopians and other concerned people&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A further letter was addressed by President Rajeshwar Singh and Secretary Baman Alif of C.I.A.O., the Court Interpreters' Association of Ontario, Canada, to Professor Federico Mayor, Director-General of UNESCO. They wrote, on 30 August:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We the undersigned, officers of the Court Interpreters Association of Ontario, C.I.A.O., of Canada, present our compliments to Your Excellency and have the honor to petition your Goodself and through you, your International Organisation, UNESCO, to intercede on behalf of the People of Ethiopia with the government of the Italian Republic for the return of the Ethiopian Obelisk from Rome to Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Obelisk, dating back to the 4th century A.D., was looted by the Italians by the special order of the Italian dictator, Benito Mussolini, in 1937 during the Italian occupation of Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In 1947 Italy signed a peace treaty with the United Nations. In article 37 of this treaty, Italy agreed to return the obelisk to Ethiopia. To date, the obelisk still stands in Rome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We now appeal to your organisation, UNESCO, as an arm of the UN, dealing with cultural affairs, to appeal to the Italian Government to abide by the treaty signed with the UN nearly one half century ago&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Neville Smith, of Ottawa, wrote to the Italian ambassador in Ottawa, Canada, on 17 September, saying:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two years ago I visited Ethiopia, and in Axum saw the ancient splendid obelisks. I learned that one of the most historic had been removed to Rome. I understood that negotiations were underway to have this returned to its rightful home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Recently I heard an interview with Professor Richard Pankhurst on CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would be interested to hear if talks are proceeding, and if so when the obelisk might be expected back in Ethiopia, thus righting a wrong dating from old wars and brief colonialism&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numerous letters were also despatched from Britain. A public-spirited British woman, Sylvia Ayling, wrote to the Italian Embassy in London, on 8 September, to declare, in part:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Publicity has recently been given in the Guardian newspaper to the fact that the Aksum Obelisk at present has been standing in Rome since 1937. And I was reminded last week of many other unethical acts committed by fascist Italy during the Second World War, when Professor Mack Smith, author of an acclaimed biography of Benito Mussolini, was interviewed on the World At One (the Radio Four new television programme)...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would be fitting, as the Millennium approaches, that consideration be urgently given to what would appear to be the very just demands made by the Ethiopian people, in accordance with Article 37 of the Italian Peace Treaty with the United Nations, to return the obelisk. I add my own appeal, as a European whose conscience has been stirred&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A letter demanding the obelisk's immediate repatriation was also despatched to the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in Rome, on 23 October, by the well-known British Labour Member of Parliament, and former rernowned actress, Glenda Jackson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The time has at last arrived for the Italian Government to &quot;come clean&quot;; and to announce to the world a timetable for the immediate return of the obelisk to the country whose people sculpted almost two millennia ago.</SPAN></P>
