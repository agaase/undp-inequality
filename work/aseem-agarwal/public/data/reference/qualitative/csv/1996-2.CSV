Some 20,000 spectators watched the finals at the National Stadium in Sururele, a Lagos neighbourhood, with the 100 metre race for men and women as major highlights. African track queen Mary Onyali-Omagbemi beat all comers in the women's 100-metre race, finishing in 10.67 seconds. She also won gold in the women's 200-metre race. Davidson Ezinwa, nother United States-based sprinter, won the men's 100-metre dash with a time of 9.86 seconds. But the times are subject to confirmation because officials said they were manually recorded.  Two of Nigeria's four athletes, Chioma Ajunwa and Clement Chukwu, made impressive comeback after serving their four-year ban by the International Athletics Federation. Chioma came second behind Onyali-Omagemi in the 100-metre women's race and picked up the gold in the long jump. Chukwu, on the other hand, placed third in the 400 metres behind policeman Sunday Bada and Jude Monye who placed first and second in the explosive race. Two other returnees Charity Okpara and Innocent Asonze were not as lucky.  (DOCUMENT) US Groups Plan March and Vigil Against Dictatorship in Zaire","387 words"," Africa News","","",
